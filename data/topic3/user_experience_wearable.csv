"Benchmarking Wearable Robots: Challenges and Recommendations From Functional, User Experience, and Methodological Perspectives","Diego Torricelli, Carlos Rodriguez-Guerrero, Jan F Veneman, Simona Crea, Kristin Briem, Bigna Lenggenhager, Philipp Beckerle, Diego Torricelli, Carlos Rodriguez-Guerrero, Jan F Veneman, Simona Crea, Kristin Briem, Bigna Lenggenhager, Philipp Beckerle",2020 Nov 13,"Wearable robots (WRs) are increasingly moving out of the labs toward real-world applications. In order for WRs to be effectively and widely adopted by end-users, a common benchmarking framework needs to be established. In this article, we outline the perspectives that in our opinion are the main determinants of this endeavor, and exemplify the complex landscape into three areas. The first perspective is related to quantifying the technical performance of the device and the physical impact of the device on the user. The second one refers to the understanding of the user's perceptual, emotional, and cognitive experience of (and with) the technology. The third one proposes a strategic path for a global benchmarking methodology, composed by reproducible experimental procedures representing real-life conditions. We hope that this paper can enable developers, researchers, clinicians and end-users to efficiently identify the most promising directions for validating their technology and drive future research efforts in the short and medium term.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33501326/,2022-11-27 11:26:36 PM
Human Factors and User Experience Issues with Ventricular Assist Device Wearable Components: A Systematic Review,"Jessica Lea Dunn, Erez Nusem, Karla Straker, Shaun Gregory, Cara Wrigley, Jessica Lea Dunn, Erez Nusem, Karla Straker, Shaun Gregory, Cara Wrigley",2019 Dec,"Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) provide continuous mechanical circulatory support during in- and out-of-hospital care. However, limitations of the external wearable components influence patient quality of life. There is insufficient understanding of the issues with such components that combines a holistic viewpoint from both human factors and user (including patient and caregiver) experience perspectives. This paper comprehensively details the issues with VAD wearable systems and proposes a way for human-centered design to bridge the gap, addressing such issues synergistically. Through the review the authors investigated: the user issues caused by wearable components of VADs, and how human factors issues correlate to the VAD user experience. A Boolean search (""ventricular assist"" AND ""human factors"" AND ""experience"") for peer-reviewed studies published between 2008 and 2018 returned 338 titles, with 35 relevant studies selected using a PRISMA process for inclusion in cross-study analysis and synthesis. This paper provides design recommendations for the issues found in the literature. Four key focus areas to inform the future design of VAD wearable components were identified-'Power Supply', 'Wearability and Travel Freedom', 'The Female Experience' and 'Intuitive Handling'. Using design to drive innovation could result in VAD wearable components which better meet or exceed users' quality of life goals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342334/,2022-11-27 11:26:50 PM
Enhancing Home Health Mobile Phone App Usability Through General Smartphone Training: Usability and Learnability Case Study,"Richard Harte, Tony Hall, Liam Glynn, Alejandro Rodríguez-Molinero, Thomas Scharf, Leo R Quinlan, Gearóid ÓLaighin, Richard Harte, Tony Hall, Liam Glynn, Alejandro Rodríguez-Molinero, Thomas Scharf, Leo R Quinlan, Gearóid ÓLaighin",2018 Apr 26,"Background:
        
      
      Each year, millions of older adults fall, with more than 1 out of 4 older people experiencing a fall annually, thereby causing a major social and economic impact. Falling once doubles one’s chances of falling again, making fall prediction an important aspect of preventative strategies. In this study, 22 older adults aged between 65 and 85 years were trained in the use of a smartphone-based fall prediction system. The system is designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring various gait and balance parameters using a smart insole and smartphone, and is also designed to detect falls. The use case of the fall prediction system in question required the users to interact with the smartphone via an app for device syncing, data uploads, and checking system status.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to observe the effect that basic smartphone training could have on the user experience of a group that is not technically proficient with smartphones when using a new connected health system. It was expected that even short rudimentary training could have a large effect on user experience and therefore increase the chances of the group accepting the new technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All participants received training on how to use the system smartphone app; half of the participants (training group) also received extra training on how to use basic functions of the smartphone, such as making calls and sending text messages, whereas the other half did not receive this extra training (no extra training group). Comparison of training group and no extra training group was carried out using metrics such as satisfaction rating, time taken to complete tasks, cues required to complete tasks, and errors made during tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The training group fared better in the first 3 days of using the system. There were significant recorded differences in number of cues required and errors committed between the two groups. By the fourth and fifth day of use, both groups were performing at the same level when using the system.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Supplementary basic smartphone training may be critical in trials where a smartphone app–based system for health intervention purposes is being introduced to a population that is not proficient with technology. This training could prevent early technology rejection and increase the engagement of older participants and their overall user experience with the system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29699969/,2022-11-27 11:27:00 PM
Embedded Model Predictive Control for a Wearable Artificial Pancreas,"Ankush Chakrabarty, Elizabeth Healey, Dawei Shi, Stamatina Zavitsanou, Francis J Doyle 3rd, Eyal Dassau, Ankush Chakrabarty, Elizabeth Healey, Dawei Shi, Stamatina Zavitsanou, Francis J Doyle 3rd, Eyal Dassau",2020 Nov,"While artificial pancreas (AP) systems are expected to improve the quality of life among people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the design of convenient systems that optimize the user experience, especially for those with active lifestyles, such as children and adolescents, still remains an open research question. In this work, we introduce an embeddable design and implementation of model predictive control (MPC) of AP systems for people with T1DM that significantly reduces the weight and on-body footprint of the AP system. The embeddable controller is based on a zone MPC that has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies. The proposed embedded zone MPC features a simpler design of the periodic safe zone in the cost function and the utilization of state-of-the-art alternating minimization algorithms for solving the convex programming problems inherent to MPC with linear models subject to convex constraints. Off-line closed-loop data generated by the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova simulator is used to select an optimization algorithm and corresponding tuning parameters. Through hardware-in-the-loop in silico results on a limited-resource Arduino Zero (Feather M0) platform, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed embedded MPC. In spite of resource limitations, our embedded zone MPC manages to achieve comparable performance of that of the full-version zone MPC implemented in a 64-bit desktop for scenarios with/without meal-disturbance compensations. Metrics for performance comparison included median percent time in the euglycemic ([70, 180] mg/dL range) of 84.3% vs. 83.1% for announced meals, with an equivalence test yielding p = 0.0013 and 66.2% vs. 66.0% for unannounced meals with p = 0.0028.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33762804/,2022-11-27 11:27:01 PM
Novel Bluetooth-Enabled Tubeless Insulin Pump: A User Experience Design Approach for a Connected Digital Diabetes Management Platform,"Sandhya S Pillalamarri, Lauren M Huyett, Aiman Abdel-Malek, Sandhya S Pillalamarri, Lauren M Huyett, Aiman Abdel-Malek",2018 Nov,"Background:
        
      
      Medical device technology is evolving at a rapid pace, with increasing patient expectations to use modern technologies for diabetes management. With the significant expansion of the use of wireless technology and complex, securely connected digital platforms in medical devices, end user needs and behaviors have become essential areas of focus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This article provides a detailed description of the user-centered design approach implemented in developing the Omnipod DASH™ Insulin Management System (Insulet Corp., Billerica, MA) Bluetooth®-enabled locked-down Android device handheld controller (Personal Diabetes Manager, PDM). Key methodologies used in the PDM design are described, including how the science of user experience (UX) was integrated into new agile product development. UX methods employed included heuristic evaluations of insulin pumps, iterative formative usability testing, information architecture studies, in-home ethnographic visits, participatory design activities, and interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over 343 users participated in UX research and testing. Key design choices informed by UX research included updating the layout of critical data on the PDM home page, providing access to requested contextual information while a bolus is in progress, and creating an easy-to-understand visual of a 24-hour basal program. Task completion rates for comprehending information on the PDM home page were 87% or greater. The System Usability Scale result for the design prior to limited market release was 84.4 ± 13.4 (out of 100; n = 37).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The UX process described in this article can serve as a blueprint for medical device manufacturers seeking to enhance product development. Adopting UX research methodologies will help ensure that new diabetes devices are safe, easy-to-use, and meet the needs of users.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30304951/,2022-11-27 11:27:01 PM
Augmenting Critical Care Patient Monitoring Using Wearable Technology: Review of Usability and Human Factors,"Evismar Andrade, Leo Quinlan, Richard Harte, Dara Byrne, Enda Fallon, Martina Kelly, Siobhan Casey, Frank Kirrane, Paul O'Connor, Denis O'Hora, Michael Scully, John Laffey, Patrick Pladys, Alain Beuchée, Gearoid ÓLaighin, Evismar Andrade, Leo Quinlan, Richard Harte, Dara Byrne, Enda Fallon, Martina Kelly, Siobhan Casey, Frank Kirrane, Paul O'Connor, Denis O'Hora, Michael Scully, John Laffey, Patrick Pladys, Alain Beuchée, Gearoid ÓLaighin",2021 May 25,"Background:
        
      
      Continuous monitoring of the vital signs of critical care patients is an essential component of critical care medicine. For this task, clinicians use a patient monitor (PM), which conveys patient vital sign data through a screen and an auditory alarm system. Some limitations with PMs have been identified in the literature, such as the need for visual contact with the PM screen, which could result in reduced focus on the patient in specific scenarios, and the amount of noise generated by the PM alarm system. With the advancement of material science and electronic technology, wearable devices have emerged as a potential solution for these problems. This review presents the findings of several studies that focused on the usability and human factors of wearable devices designed for use in critical care patient monitoring.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to review the current state of the art in wearable devices intended for use by clinicians to monitor vital signs of critical care patients in hospital settings, with a focus on the usability and human factors of the devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases was conducted, and 20 studies were identified and critically reviewed by the authors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 3 types of wearable devices: tactile, head-mounted, and smartwatch displays. In most cases, these devices were intended for use by anesthesiologists, but nurses and surgeons were also identified as potentially important users of wearable technology in critical care medicine. Although the studies investigating tactile displays revealed their potential to improve clinical monitoring, usability problems related to comfort need to be overcome before they can be considered suitable for use in clinical practice. Only a few studies investigated the usability and human factors of tactile displays by conducting user testing involving critical care professionals. The studies of head-mounted displays (HMDs) revealed that these devices could be useful in critical care medicine, particularly from an ergonomics point of view. By reducing the amount of time the user spends averting their gaze from the patient to a separate screen, HMDs enable clinicians to improve their patient focus and reduce the potential of repetitive strain injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Researchers and designers of new wearable devices for use in critical care medicine should strive to achieve not only enhanced performance but also enhanced user experience for their users, especially in terms of comfort and ease of use. These aspects of wearable displays must be extensively tested with the intended end users in a setting that properly reflects the intended context of use before their adoption can be considered in clinical settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34032574/,2022-11-27 11:27:03 PM
StraightenUp+: Monitoring of Posture during Daily Activities for Older Persons Using Wearable Sensors,"Gabriela Cajamarca, Iyubanit Rodríguez, Valeria Herskovic, Mauricio Campos, Juan Carlos Riofrío, Gabriela Cajamarca, Iyubanit Rodríguez, Valeria Herskovic, Mauricio Campos, Juan Carlos Riofrío",2018 Oct 11,"Monitoring the posture of older persons using portable sensors while they carry out daily activities can facilitate the process of generating indicators with which to evaluate their health and quality of life. The majority of current research into such sensors focuses primarily on their functionality and accuracy, and minimal effort is dedicated to understanding the experience of older persons who interact with the devices. This study proposes a wearable device to identify the bodily postures of older persons, while also looking into the perceptions of the users. For the purposes of this study, thirty independent and semi-independent older persons undertook eight different types of physical activity, including: walking, raising arms, lowering arms, leaning forward, sitting, sitting upright, transitioning from standing to sitting, and transitioning from sitting to standing. The data was classified offline, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%, while overall device user perception was positive.

Manufacturing worker perceptions of using wearable inertial sensors for multiple work shifts,"Xuanxuan Zhang, Mark C Schall Jr, Howard Chen, Sean Gallagher, Gerard A Davis, Richard Sesek, Xuanxuan Zhang, Mark C Schall Jr, Howard Chen, Sean Gallagher, Gerard A Davis, Richard Sesek",2022 Jan,"Wearable inertial sensors may be used to objectively quantify exposure to some physical risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. However, concerns regarding their potential negative effects on user safety and satisfaction remain. This study characterized the self-reported daily discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing inertial sensors on the upper arms, trunk, and dominant wrist of 31 manufacturing workers collected over 15 full work shifts. Results indicated that the workers considered the devices as generally comfortable to wear, not distracting, and not burdensome to use. Exposure to non-neutral postures (discomfort, right arm, beta = 0.02; trunk, beta = -0.01), non-cyclic tasks (distraction, beta = -0.26), and higher body mass indices (discomfort, beta = 0.05; distraction, beta = 0.02) contributed to statistically significant (p < 0.05), albeit practically small increases in undesirable ratings. For instance, for each additional percentage of time working with the right arm elevated ≥60°, self-reported discomfort ratings increased 0.02 cm on a standard 10 cm visual analog scale. Female workers reported less discomfort and distraction while wearing the sensors at work than males (discomfort, beta = -0.93; distraction, beta = -0.3). In general, the low ratings of discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing the devices during work suggests that inertial sensors may be suitable for extended use among manufacturing workers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34507084/,2022-11-27 11:27:05 PM
Data Collection Mechanisms in Health and Wellness Apps: Review and Analysis,"Ben Joseph Philip, Mohamed Abdelrazek, Alessio Bonti, Scott Barnett, John Grundy, Ben Joseph Philip, Mohamed Abdelrazek, Alessio Bonti, Scott Barnett, John Grundy",2022 Mar 9,"Background:
        
      
      There has been a steady rise in the availability of health wearables and built-in smartphone sensors that can be used to collect health data reliably and conveniently from end users. Given the feature overlaps and user tendency to use several apps, these are important factors impacting user experience. However, there is limited work on analyzing the data collection aspect of mobile health (mHealth) apps.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to analyze what data mHealth apps across different categories usually collect from end users and how these data are collected. This information is important to guide the development of a common data model from current widely adopted apps. This will also inform what built-in sensors and wearables, a comprehensive mHealth platform should support.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In our empirical investigation of mHealth apps, we identified app categories listed in a curated mHealth app library, which was then used to explore the Google Play Store for health and medical apps that were then filtered using our selection criteria. We downloaded these apps from a mirror site hosting Android apps and analyzed them using a script that we developed around the popular AndroGuard tool. We analyzed the use of Bluetooth peripherals and built-in sensors to understand how a given app collects health data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We retrieved 3251 apps meeting our criteria, and our analysis showed that 10.74% (349/3251) of these apps requested Bluetooth access. We found that 50.9% (259/509) of the Bluetooth service universally unique identifiers to be known in these apps, with the remainder being vendor specific. The most common health-related Bluetooth Low Energy services using known universally unique identifiers were Heart Rate, Glucose, and Body Composition. App permissions showed the most used device module or sensor to be the camera (669/3251, 20.57%), closely followed by location (598/3251, 18.39%), with the highest occurrence in the staying healthy app category.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found that not many health apps used built-in sensors or peripherals for collecting health data. The small number of the apps using Bluetooth, with an even smaller number of apps using standard Bluetooth Low Energy services, indicates a wider use of proprietary algorithms and custom services, which restrict the device use. The use of standard profiles could open this ecosystem further and could provide end users more options for apps. The relatively small proportion of apps using built-in sensors along with a high reliance on manual data entry suggests the need for more research into using sensors for data collection in health and fitness apps, which may be more desirable and improve end user experience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35262499/,2022-11-27 11:27:18 PM
Real-world user experience with seizure detection wearable devices in the home environment,"Levente Hadady, Péter Klivényi, Dániel Fabó, Sándor Beniczky, Levente Hadady, Péter Klivényi, Dániel Fabó, Sándor Beniczky",2022 Feb 23.,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate direct user experience with wearable seizure detection devices in the home environment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A structured online questionnaire was completed by 242 users (175 caregivers and 67 persons with epilepsy), most of the patients (87.19%) having tonic-clonic seizures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The vast majority of the users were overall satisfied with the wearable device, considered that using the device was easy, and agreed that the use of the device improved their quality of life (median = 6 on 7-point Likert scale). A high retention rate (84.58%) and a long median usage time (14 months) were reported. In the home environment, most users (75.85%) experienced seizure detection sensitivity similar (≥95%) to what was previously reported in validation studies in epilepsy monitoring units. The experienced false alarm rate was relatively low (0-0.43 per day). Due to the alarms, almost one third of persons with epilepsy (PWEs; 30.00%) experienced decrease in the number of seizure-related injuries, and almost two thirds of PWEs (65.41%) experienced improvement in the accuracy of seizure diaries. Nonvalidated devices had significantly lower retention rate, overall satisfaction, perceived sensitivity, and improvement in quality of life, as compared with validated devices.

Assessing the usability of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity in chronic conditions: a systematic review,"Alison Keogh, Rob Argent, Amy Anderson, Brian Caulfield, William Johnston, Alison Keogh, Rob Argent, Amy Anderson, Brian Caulfield, William Johnston",2021 Sep 15,"Background:
        
      
      The World Health Organisation's global strategy for digital health emphasises the importance of patient involvement. Understanding the usability and acceptability of wearable devices is a core component of this. However, usability assessments to date have focused predominantly on healthy adults. There is a need to understand the patient perspective of wearable devices in participants with chronic health conditions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted to identify any study design that included a usability assessment of wearable devices to measure mobility, through gait and physical activity, within five cohorts with chronic conditions (Parkinson's disease [PD], multiple sclerosis [MS], congestive heart failure, [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD], and proximal femoral fracture [PFF]).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-seven studies were identified. Substantial heterogeneity in the quality of reporting, the methods used to assess usability, the devices used, and the aims of the studies precluded any meaningful comparisons. Questionnaires were used in the majority of studies (70.3%; n = 26) with a reliance on intervention specific measures (n = 16; 61.5%). For those who used interviews (n = 17; 45.9%), no topic guides were provided, while methods of analysis were not reported in over a third of studies (n = 6; 35.3%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Usability of wearable devices is a poorly measured and reported variable in chronic health conditions. Although the heterogeneity in how these devices are implemented implies acceptance, the patient voice should not be assumed. In the absence of being able to make specific usability conclusions, the results of this review instead recommends that future research needs to: (1) Conduct usability assessments as standard, irrespective of the cohort under investigation or the type of study undertaken. (2) Adhere to basic reporting standards (e.g. COREQ) including the basic details of the study. Full copies of any questionnaires and interview guides should be supplied through supplemental files. (3) Utilise mixed methods research to gather a more comprehensive understanding of usability than either qualitative or quantitative research alone will provide. (4) Use previously validated questionnaires alongside any intervention specific measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34526053/,2022-11-27 11:27:32 PM
Smartphone Apps for Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review,"Joseph Firth, John Torous, Joseph Firth, John Torous",2015 Nov 6,"Background:
        
      
      There is increasing interest in using mobile technologies such as smartphones for improving the care of patients with schizophrenia. However, less is known about the current clinical evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of smartphone apps in this population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To review the published literature of smartphone apps applied for the care of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An electronic database search of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, PsycINFO, and Embase was conducted on May 24, 2015. All eligible studies were systematically reviewed, and proportional meta-analyses were applied to pooled data on recruitment, retention, and adherence to examine the overall feasibility of smartphone interventions for schizophrenia.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our search produced 226 results from which 7 eligible articles were identified, reporting on 5 studies of smartphone apps for patients with schizophrenia. All examined feasibility, and one assessed the preliminary efficacy of a smartphone intervention for schizophrenia. Study lengths varied between 6 and 130 days. Overall retention was 92% (95% CI 82-98%). Participants consistently used the smartphone apps on more than 85% of days during the study period, averaging 3.95 interactions per person per day. Furthermore, participants responded to 71.9% of automated prompts (95% CI 65.7-77.8%). Participants reported a range of potential benefits from the various interventions, and user experience was largely positive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although small, the current published literature demonstrates strong evidence for the feasibility of using smartphones to enhance the care of people with schizophrenia. High rates of engagement and satisfaction with a broad range of apps suggest the nascent potential of this mobile technology. However, there remains limited data on the efficacy of such interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26546039/,2022-11-27 11:27:32 PM
Development of an Ambulatory Biofeedback App to Enhance Emotional Awareness in Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder: Multicycle Usability Testing Study,"Youri Pmj Derks, Randy Klaassen, Gerben J Westerhof, Ernst T Bohlmeijer, Matthijs L Noordzij, Youri Pmj Derks, Randy Klaassen, Gerben J Westerhof, Ernst T Bohlmeijer, Matthijs L Noordzij",2019 Oct 15,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with borderline personality disorder experience great difficulties in regulating their emotions. They often are unable to effectively detect their emotional arousal and struggle to timely apply learned techniques for emotion regulation. Although the use of continuous wearable biofeedback has been repeatedly suggested as an option to improve patients' emotional awareness, this type of app is not yet available for clinical use. Therefore, we developed an ambulatory biofeedback app named Sense-IT that can be integrated in mental health care.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to develop an ambulatory biofeedback app for mental health care that helps with learning to better recognize changes in personal emotional arousal and increases emotional awareness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using several methods in a tailored User Centred Design (UCD) framework, we tested the app's usability and user experience (UX) via a cyclic developmental process with multiple user groups (patients, therapists, and UCD experts; 3-5 per group, per cycle).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The process resulted in a stable prototype of the app that meets most of the identified user requirements. The app was valued as useful and usable by involved patients, therapists, and UCD experts. On the Subjective Usability Scale (SUS), the patients rated the app as ""Good"" (average score of 78.8), whereas the therapists rated the app as ""OK"" (average score of 59.4). The UCD experts judged the app's overall usability as between ""OK"" and ""acceptable"" (average score of 0.87 on a cognitive walkthrough). As most critical usability problems were identified and addressed in the first cycle of the prototyping process, subsequent cycles were mainly about implementing new or extending existing functions, and other adjustments to improve UX.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      mHealth development within a clinical mental health setting is challenging, yet feasible and welcomed by targeted users. This paper shows how new mHealth interventions for mental health care can be met with enthusiasm and openness by user groups that are known to be reluctant to embrace technological innovations. The use of the UCD framework, involving multiple user groups, proved to be of added value during design and realization as evidenced by the complementary requirements and perspectives. Future directions on studying clinical effectiveness of the app, appliance of the app in other fields, and the implications of integration of the app for daily practice in mental health are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31617851/,2022-11-27 11:27:33 PM
From Bits of Data to Bits of Knowledge-An On-Board Classification Framework for Wearable Sensing Systems,"Pawel Zalewski, Letizia Marchegiani, Atis Elsts, Robert Piechocki, Ian Craddock, Xenofon Fafoutis, Pawel Zalewski, Letizia Marchegiani, Atis Elsts, Robert Piechocki, Ian Craddock, Xenofon Fafoutis",2020 Mar 16,"Wearable systems constitute a promising solution to the emerging challenges of healthcare provision, feeding machine learning frameworks with necessary data. In practice, however, raw data collection is expensive in terms of energy, and therefore imposes a significant maintenance burden to the user, which in turn results in poor user experience, as well as significant data loss due to improper battery maintenance. In this paper, we propose a framework for on-board activity classification targeting severely energy-constrained wearable systems. The proposed framework leverages embedded classifiers to activate power-hungry sensing elements only when they are useful, and to distil the raw data into knowledge that is eventually transmitted over the air. We implement the proposed framework on a prototype wearable system and demonstrate that it can decrease the energy requirements by one order of magnitude, yielding high classification accuracy that is reduced by approximately 5%, as compared to a cloud-based reference system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32188114/,2022-11-27 11:27:34 PM
The Challenging Path to Developing a Mobile Health Device for Epilepsy: The Current Landscape and Where We Go From Here,"Ilona Hubbard, Sandor Beniczky, Philippe Ryvlin, Ilona Hubbard, Sandor Beniczky, Philippe Ryvlin",2021 Oct 1,"Seizure detection, and more recently seizure forecasting, represent important avenues of clinical development in epilepsy, promoted by progress in wearable devices and mobile health (mHealth), which might help optimizing seizure control and prevention of seizure-related mortality and morbidity in persons with epilepsy. Yet, very long-term continuous monitoring of seizure-sensitive biosignals in the ambulatory setting presents a number of challenges. We herein provide an overview of these challenges and current technological landscape of mHealth devices for seizure detection. Specifically, we display, which types of sensor modalities and analytical methods are available, and give insight into current clinical practice guidelines, main outcomes of clinical validation studies, and discuss how to evaluate device performance at point-of-care facilities.

A novel computational framework of cognitive wayfinding in an indoor environment is proposed, which contains a context model, a route model, and a process model. A hierarchical structure is proposed to represent the cognitive context knowledge of indoor scenes. Given a start position and a destination, a Bayesian network model is proposed to represent the navigation route derived from the context model. A novel dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model is proposed to accommodate the dynamic process of navigation based on real-time first-person-view visual input, which involves multiple asynchronous temporal dependencies. To adapt to large variations in travel time through trip segments, we propose an online adaptation algorithm for the DBN model, leading to a self-adaptive DBN. A prototype system is built and tested for technical performance and user experience.

However, the available data on WR user experience (UX) studies are limited, especially during the prototyping phase. Therefore, this study aims to examine the overall experience of WRs during the prototyping phase based on an exploratory research model. This theoretical model considered usability, hedonic quality, and attitude toward using WRs as key factors in explaining and predicting overall experience. To test the hypotheses inherent in the research model, quantitative empirical research was conducted and the data were analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results from the PLS-SEM analysis revealed the significance level of correlations between the latent variables in the research model. The exploratory research model was able to explain up to 53.2% of the variance in the overall experience of using WRs, indicating medium predictive power.

A Wearable Sensor-Based Exercise Biofeedback System: Mixed Methods Evaluation of Formulift,"Martin Aidan O'Reilly, Patrick Slevin, Tomas Ward, Brian Caulfield, Martin Aidan O'Reilly, Patrick Slevin, Tomas Ward, Brian Caulfield",2018 Jan 31,"Background:
        
      
      Formulift is a newly developed mobile health (mHealth) app that connects to a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) worn on the left thigh. The IMU captures users' movements as they exercise, and the app analyzes the data to count repetitions in real time and classify users' exercise technique. The app also offers feedback and guidance to users on exercising safely and effectively.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to assess the Formulift system with three different and realistic types of potential users (beginner gym-goers, experienced gym-goers, and qualified strength and conditioning [S&C] coaches) under a number of categories: (1) usability, (2) functionality, (3) the perceived impact of the system, and (4) the subjective quality of the system. It was also desired to discover suggestions for future improvements to the system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 15 healthy volunteers participated (12 males; 3 females; age: 23.8 years [SD 1.80]; height: 1.79 m [SD 0.07], body mass: 78.4 kg [SD 9.6]). Five participants were beginner gym-goers, 5 were experienced gym-goers, and 5 were qualified and practicing S&C coaches. IMU data were first collected from each participant to create individualized exercise classifiers for them. They then completed a number of nonexercise-related tasks with the app. Following this, a workout was completed using the system, involving squats, deadlifts, lunges, and single-leg squats. Participants were then interviewed about their user experience and completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Thematic analysis was completed on all interview transcripts, and survey results were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Qualitative and quantitative analysis found the system has ""good"" to ""excellent"" usability. The system achieved a mean (SD) SUS usability score of 79.2 (8.8). Functionality was also deemed to be good, with many users reporting positively on the systems repetition counting, technique classification, and feedback. A number of bugs were found, and other suggested changes to the system were also made. The overall subjective quality of the app was good, with a median star rating of 4 out of 5 (interquartile range, IQR: 3-5). Participants also reported that the system would aid their technique, provide motivation, reassure them, and help them avoid injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrated an overall positive evaluation of Formulift in the categories of usability, functionality, perceived impact, and subjective quality. Users also suggested a number of changes for future iterations of the system.

The resulting data may be used directly by a consumer, or shared with a clinician for treatment, a caregiver for assistance, or a health coach for support. The data can also be used by researchers to develop and evaluate just-in-time interventions that leverage mobile technology to help individuals manage their symptoms and behavior in real time and as needed. Such wearable systems have huge potential for promoting delivery of anywhere-anytime health care, improving public health, and enhancing the quality of life for many people. The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health at Dartmouth College, a P30 ""Center of Excellence"" supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, conducted a workshop in February 2017 on innovations in emerging technology, user-centered design, and data analytics for behavioral health, with presentations by a diverse range of experts in the field.

In this paper, we summarize the workshop panels on mobile sensing, user experience design, statistics and machine learning, and privacy and security, and conclude with suggested research directions for this important and emerging field of applying digital approaches to behavioral health. Workshop insights yielded four key directions for future research: (1) a need for behavioral health researchers to work iteratively with experts in emerging technology and data analytics, (2) a need for research into optimal user-interface design for behavioral health technologies, (3) a need for privacy-oriented design from the beginning of a novel technology, and (4) the need to develop new analytical methods that can scale to thousands of individuals and billions of data points.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29925493/,2022-11-27 11:28:03 PM
StayFit: a wearable application for Gym based power training,"Maram Maheedhar, Aman Gaurav, Vivek Jilla, Vijay N Tiwari, Rangavittal Narayanan, Maram Maheedhar, Aman Gaurav, Vivek Jilla, Vijay N Tiwari, Rangavittal Narayanan",2016 Aug,"Comprehensive fitness training involves both cardiorespiratory and power components. Often power/muscle strength training is confused with cardiorespiratory endurance training. However, each of them target different physiological aspects of fitness. Although, wearable based fitness trackers designed towards cardiorespiratory endurance training are available in the market, a dedicated wearable based fitness application designed for power training/tracking is still not readily available to fitness enthusiasts. With growing usage of wearable technology to manage and track personal health, it is imperative to develop health/fitness applications for wearables. A wearable based application for power training will allow the user to track build-up of muscle strength unobtrusively over a period of time. This work provides a framework and design for automatic detection, counting repetitions of strength training Gym exercises (covering all the major muscle groups), estimate personalized calories spent in each session and track power on a standalone Gear watch (both analysis and display including User Experience(UX) design). Our proposed method detects activity with ~96% sensitivity and ~96% specificity on an average and count repetitions with an overall accuracy of >95% using motion sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope) for eight major Gym exercises. Additionally, using heart rate sensor data we have provided a mechanism to individually track the power/muscle strength of a person. This work will give further impetus towards developing wearable based systems for personalized fitness tracking and training. This will also give an option for wearable users to address both the crucial aspects of fitness (cardiorespiratory and muscle strength).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28269687/,2022-11-27 11:28:04 PM
Typing on a Smartwatch While Mobile: A Comparison of Input Methods,"Colton J Turner, Barbara S Chaparro, Jibo He, Colton J Turner, Barbara S Chaparro, Jibo He",2021 Sep,"Objective:
        
      
      The user experience of typing on a smartwatch was evaluated with three unique input methods (tap, trace, and handwriting) while standing and while walking.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Despite widespread development within the technology industry, smartwatches have had a relatively slow adoption worldwide compared to smartphones. One limiting factor of smartwatches has been the lack of an efficient means of text entry. The 2017 release of Android Wear addressed this issue by providing support for native text entry (i.e., tap, trace, and handwriting). Determining how user performance and subjective ratings compare across these input methods is essential to understanding their contribution to smartwatch user experience.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Twenty college-age individuals typed phrases using tap, trace, and handwriting input on a smartwatch in three different mobility scenarios (standing, walking a simple course, walking a complex course).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants typed faster with trace (30 words per minute; WPM) than with tap (20 WPM) and handwriting (18 WPM), regardless of mobility. Trace also outperformed tap and handwriting across all subjective metrics, regardless of mobility.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Trace input appears to be especially well suited for typing on a smartwatch as it was found to be objectively and subjectively superior to tap and handwriting regardless of user mobility. Objectively, typing speeds with trace are shown to be nearly two times faster than most alternative input methods described in the literature.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Results suggest smartwatch manufacturers should include QWERTY keyboards with trace input as a standard feature in order to provide the best overall typing experience for their users.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32031892/,2022-11-27 11:28:04 PM

Nevertheless, they normally possess short battery life and need to be recharged with external power sources with a long charging time, which seriously affects the user experience. To help extend the battery life or even replace it, a non-resonant piezoelectric-electromagnetic-triboelectric hybrid energy harvester is presented to effectively harvest energy from low-frequency human motions. In the designed structure, a moving magnet is used to simultaneously excite the three integrated energy collection units (i.e., piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and triboelectric) with a synergistic effect, such that the overall output power and energy-harvesting efficiency of the hybrid device can be greatly improved under various excitations. The experimental results show that with a vibration frequency of 4 Hz and a displacement of 200 mm, the hybrid energy harvester obtains a maximum output power of 26.17 mW at 70 kΩ for one piezoelectric generator (PEG) unit, 87.1 mW at 500 Ω for one electromagnetic generator (EMG) unit, and 63 μW at 140 MΩ for one triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) unit, respectively. Then, the generated outputs are adopted for capacitor charging, which reveals that the performance of the three-unit integration is remarkably stronger than that of individual units. Finally, the practical energy-harvesting experiments conducted on various body parts such as wrist, calf, hand, and waist indicate that the proposed hybrid energy harvester has promising application potential in constructing a self-powered wearable system as the sustainable power source.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35407286/,2022-11-27 11:28:05 PM
A Review of EEG and fMRI Measuring Aesthetic Processing in Visual User Experience Research,"Zhepeng Rui, Zhenyu Gu, Zhepeng Rui, Zhenyu Gu",2021 Dec 16,"In human-computer interaction, the visual interaction of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) plays an important role in enriching the quality of daily life. The purpose of our study analyzes the use of brain-computer interface (BCI), wearable technology, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the aesthetic processing of visual neural response to UI and UX designs. Specifically, this review aims to understand neuroaesthetic processing knowledge, aesthetic appreciation models, and the ways in which visual brain studies can improve the quality of current and future UI and UX designs. Recent research has found that subjective evaluations of aesthetic appreciation produce different results for objective evaluations of brain research analysis. We applied SWOT analysis and examined the advantages and disadvantages of both evaluation methods. Furthermore, we conducted a traditional literature review on topics pertaining to the use of aesthetic processing knowledge in the visual interaction field in terms of art therapy, information visualization, website or mobile applications, and other interactive platforms. Our main research findings from current studies have helped and motivated researchers and designers to use convincing scientific knowledge of brain event-related potential, electroencephalography, and fMRI to understand aesthetic judgment. The key trend finds that many designers, artists, and engineers use artistic BCI technology in the visual interaction experience. Herein, the scientific methods applied in the aesthetic appreciation to human-computer interface are summarized, and the influence of the latest wearable brain technology on visual interaction design is discussed. Furthermore, current possible research entry points for aesthetics, usability, and creativity in UI and UX designs are explicated.

Survey of transfemoral amputee experience and priorities for the user-centered design of powered robotic transfemoral prostheses,"Chiara Fanciullacci, Zach McKinney, Vito Monaco, Giovanni Milandri, Angelo Davalli, Rinaldo Sacchetti, Matteo Laffranchi, Lorenzo De Michieli, Andrea Baldoni, Alberto Mazzoni, Linda Paternò, Elisa Rosini, Luigi Reale, Fabio Trecate, Simona Crea, Nicola Vitiello, Emanuele Gruppioni, Chiara Fanciullacci, Zach McKinney, Vito Monaco, Giovanni Milandri, Angelo Davalli, Rinaldo Sacchetti, Matteo Laffranchi, Lorenzo De Michieli, Andrea Baldoni, Alberto Mazzoni, Linda Paternò, Elisa Rosini, Luigi Reale, Fabio Trecate, Simona Crea, Nicola Vitiello, Emanuele Gruppioni",2021 Dec 4,"Background:
        
      
      Transfemoral amputees experience a complex host of physical, psychological, and social challenges, compounded by the functional limitations of current transfemoral prostheses. However, the specific relationships between human factors and prosthesis design and performance characteristics have not yet been adequately investigated. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive single-cohort survey of 114 unilateral transfemoral amputees addressed a broad range of demographic and clinical characteristics, functional autonomy, satisfaction and attitudes towards their current prostheses, and design priorities for an ideal transfemoral prosthesis, including the possibility of active assistance from a robotic knee unit. The survey was custom-developed based on several standard questionnaires used to assess motor abilities and autonomy in activities of daily living, prosthesis satisfaction, and quality of life in lower-limb amputees. Survey data were analyzed to compare the experience (including autonomy and satisfaction) and design priorities of users of transfemoral prostheses with versus without microprocessor-controlled knee units (MPKs and NMPKs, respectively), with a subsequent analyses of cross-category correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), cost-sensitivity segmentation, and unsupervised K-means clustering applied within the most cost-sensitive participants, to identify functional groupings of users with respect to their design priorities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cohort featured predominantly younger (< 50 years) traumatic male amputees with respect to the general transfemoral amputee population, with pronounced differences in age distribution and amputation etiology (traumatic vs. non-traumatic) between MPK and NMPK groups. These differences were further reflected in user experience, with MPK users reporting significantly greater overall functional autonomy, satisfaction, and sense of prosthesis ownership than those with NMPKs, in conjunction with a decreased incidence of instability and falls. Across all participants, the leading functional priorities for an ideal transfemoral prosthesis were overall stability, adaptability to variable walking velocity, and lifestyle-related functionality, while the highest-prioritized general characteristics were reliability, comfort, and weight, with highly variable prioritization of cost according to reimbursement status. PCA and user clustering analyses revealed the possibility for functionally relevant groupings of prosthesis features and users, based on their differential prioritization of these features-with implications towards prosthesis design tradeoffs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study's findings support the understanding that when appropriately prescribed according to patient characteristics and needs in the context of a proactive rehabilitation program, advanced transfemoral prostheses promote patient mobility, autonomy, and overall health. Survey data indicate overall stability, modularity, and versatility as key design priorities for the continued development of transfemoral prosthesis technology. Finally, observed associations between prosthesis type, user experience, and attitudes concerning prosthesis ownership suggest both that prosthesis characteristics influence device acceptance and functional outcomes, and that psychosocial factors should be specifically and proactively addressed during the rehabilitation process.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34863213/,2022-11-27 11:28:29 PM
Real-Time Robust Heart Rate Estimation From Wrist-Type PPG Signals Using Multiple Reference Adaptive Noise Cancellation,"Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Rakib Hyder, Md Samzid Bin Hafiz, Mohammad Ariful Haque, Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Rakib Hyder, Md Samzid Bin Hafiz, Mohammad Ariful Haque",2018 Mar,"Heart rate (HR) monitoring using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals recorded from wearers' wrist greatly facilitates design of wearable devices and maximizes user experience. However, placing PPG sensors in wrist causes much stronger and complicated motion artifacts (MA) due to loose interface between sensors and skin. Therefore, developing robust HR estimation algorithms for wrist-type PPG signals has significant commercial values. In this paper, we propose a robust HR estimation algorithm for wrist-type PPG signals using multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) technique-termed here as ""MURAD."" The main challenge of using ANC for MA reduction is to devise a qualified reference noise signal (RNS) to the adaptive filter. We propose a novel solution by using four RNSs, namely, the three-axis accelerometer data and the difference signal between the two PPG signals. For each RNS, we get a different version of the cleaned PPG signal. Then, a set of probable HR values is estimated using all of the cleaned PPG signals, and then, the value that is closest to the estimated HR of the previous time window is chosen to be the HR estimate of the current window. Then, some peak verification techniques are employed to ensure accurate HR estimations. The proposed technique gives lower average absolute error compared to state-of-the art methods. So, MURAD method provides a promising solution to the challenge of HR monitoring using PPG in wearable devices during severe MA conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27893403/,2022-11-27 11:28:30 PM
Trials and Tribulations: mHealth Clinical Trials in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Praveen Indraratna, Uzzal Biswas, Jennifer Yu, Guenter Schreier, Sze-Yuan Ooi, Nigel H Lovell, Stephen J Redmond, Praveen Indraratna, Uzzal Biswas, Jennifer Yu, Guenter Schreier, Sze-Yuan Ooi, Nigel H Lovell, Stephen J Redmond",2021 Aug,"Introduction:
        
      
      Mobile phone-based interventions in cardiovascular disease are growing in popularity. A randomised control trial (RCT) for a novel smartphone app-based model of care, named TeleClinical Care - Cardiac (TCC-Cardiac), commenced in February 2019, targeted at patients being discharged after care for an acute coronary syndrome or episode of decompensated heart failure. The app was paired to a digital sphygmomanometer, weighing scale and a wearable fitness band, all loaned to the patient, and allowed clinicians to respond to abnormal readings. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated several modifications to the trial in order to protect participants from potential exposure to infection. The use of TCC-Cardiac during the pandemic inspired the development of a similar model of care (TCC-COVID), targeted at patients being managed at home with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Recruitment for the TCC-Cardiac trial was terminated shortly after the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Telephone follow-up was commenced, in order to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to hospital staff and patients. Equipment was returned or collected by a 'no-contact' method. The TCC-COVID app and model of care had similar functionality to the original TCC-Cardiac app. Participants were enrolled exclusively by remote methods. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate were measured by a pulse oximeter, and symptomatology measured by questionnaire. Measurement results were manually entered into the app and transmitted to an online server for medical staff to review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 164 patients were involved in the TCC-Cardiac trial, with 102 patients involved after the onset of the pandemic. There were no hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in this cohort. The study was successfully completed, with only three participants lost to follow-up. During the pandemic, 5 of 49 (10%) of patients in the intervention arm were readmitted compared to 12 of 53 (23%) in the control arm. Also, in this period, 28 of 29 (97%) of all clinically significant alerts received by the monitoring team were managed successfully in the outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalisation. Patients found the user experience largely positive, with the average rating for the app being 4.56 out of 5. 26 patients have currently been enrolled for TCC-COVID. Recruitment is ongoing. All patients have been safely and effectively monitored, with no major adverse clinical events or technical malfunctions. Patient satisfaction has been high.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The TCC-Cardiac RCT was successfully completed despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Use of the app had an added benefit during the pandemic as participants could be monitored safely from home. The model of care inspired the development of an app with similar functionality designed for use with patients diagnosed with COVID-19.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882601/,2022-11-27 11:28:31 PM
A novel upper-limb tracking system in a virtual environment for stroke rehabilitation,"Kuan Cha, Jinying Wang, Yan Li, Longbin Shen, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyi Long, Kuan Cha, Jinying Wang, Yan Li, Longbin Shen, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyi Long",2021 Nov 27,"Background:
        
      
      The transfer of the behaviors of a human's upper limbs to an avatar is widely used in the field of virtual reality rehabilitation. To perform the transfer, movement tracking technology is required. Traditionally, wearable tracking devices are used for tracking; however, these devices are expensive and cumbersome. Recently, non-wearable upper-limb tracking solutions have been proposed, which are less expensive and more comfortable. However, most products cannot track the upper limbs, including the arms and all the fingers at the same time, which limits the limb parts for tracking in a virtual environment and may lead to a limited rehabilitation effect.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this paper, a novel virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) was developed for upper-limb rehabilitation. The VRRS could track the motion of both upper limbs, integrate fine finger motion and the range of motion of the entire arm and map the motion to an avatar. To test the performance of VRRS, two experiments were designed. In the first experiment, we investigated the effect of VRRS on virtual body ownership, agency and location of the body and usability in 8 healthy participants by comparing it with a partial upper-limb tracking method based on a Leap Motion controller (LP) in the same virtual environments. In the second experiment, we examined the feasibility of VRRS in upper-limb rehabilitation with 27 stroke patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      VRRS improved the users' senses of body ownership, agency, and location of the body. The users preferred using the VRRS to using the LP. In addition, we found that although the upper limb motor function of patients from all groups was improved, the difference between the FM scores tested on the first day and the last day of the experimental group was more significant than that of the control groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A VRRS with motion tracking of the upper limbs and avatar control including the arms and all the fingers was developed. It resulted in an improved user experience of embodiment and effectively improved the effects of upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients.

Consumer Wearable Information and Health Self Management by Older Adults,"Ann Borda, Cecily Gilbert, Kathleen Gray, Deepa Prabhu, Ann Borda, Cecily Gilbert, Kathleen Gray, Deepa Prabhu",2018,"Background:
        
      
      The present study was undertaken to build an evidence base focusing on an ageing population who are using or have used consumer wearables to collect and manage information about their personal health status. The primary objective was to understand the health self-management requirements, frailty and age related changes, and the health information support provided by consumer wearable devices, specifically in the context of older adults living independently.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The study aimed to recruit older adults to respond to an online questionnaire. Inclusion criteria for the selection of study participants were: Aged 55 or over, independent living, and currently using or having used a wearable device or devices for health self-management in the past year. The online survey questionnaire represented a cross-section of variables in three sections: (1) Use of wearables for health monitoring, (2) Demographics and (3) Health, physical condition and wellness. A subset of the questions was drawn from the Tilburg Frailty Indicator.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Summary findings from the completed questionnaires suggest the use of wearable health information supports aspects of health self-management activities among independent living seniors. Personal variations and user characteristics in the extent and consistency of the use of wearable information, and user experience in the process, was more difficult to extrapolate, for example, in health information sharing.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Responses to the survey do not indicate widespread use of information from consumer wearables for health self-management among older adults. However, among the respondents, more than half were willing to participate in a follow-up interview by a researcher on their wearable health information use. Further research will explore what they have to say about this information use in relation to frailty and age related changes, and about the way that such information may be integrated into health and aged care support systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29507259/,2022-11-27 11:28:32 PM

      Several attempts have been made to incorporate smart glasses in the medical field. We applied wearable display glasses to show the position of an observer during endoscopy and compared students' responses between the conventional and new methods.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We surveyed 28 medical students regarding the use of wearable display devices. The students used wearable display glasses to observe an endoscopic procedure and answered the prepared questionnaire. Their collected responses were analyzed for statistical correlations between each variable.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survey of medical students revealed disadvantages including dizziness (dissatisfied and very dissatisfied: 21.5%) and eye fatigue (25% dissatisfied) and advantages including concentration (satisfied and very satisfied: 57.2%) and securing patient rights (71.4%). The students showed more positive than negative reviews regarding the new devices (32.1% vs. 21.5%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We investigated the advantages and disadvantages of viewing the endoscope image with new wearable display glasses compared to the conventional method using the survey to record user experience. The results revealed relatively positive responses from the medical students in the survey. If the new device compensates for some shortcomings, its use in the endoscopy room will be feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33715343/,2022-11-27 11:28:33 PM
Mixed reality holograms for heart surgery planning: first user experience in congenital heart disease,"H Brun, R A B Bugge, L K R Suther, S Birkeland, R Kumar, E Pelanis, O J Elle, H Brun, R A B Bugge, L K R Suther, S Birkeland, R Kumar, E Pelanis, O J Elle",2019 Aug 1,"Aims:
        
      
      Proof of concept and feasibility study for preoperative diagnostic use of mixed reality (MR) holograms of individual 3D heart models from standard cardiac computed tomography angiograms (CTA) images. Optimal repair for complex congenital heart disease poses high demands on 3D anatomical imagination. Three-dimensional printed heart models are increasingly used for improved morphological understanding during surgical and interventional planning. Holograms are a dynamic and interactive alternative, probably with wider applications.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      A 3D heart model was segmented from CTA images in a patient with double outlet right ventricle and transposition of the great arteries (DORV-TGA). The hologram was visualized in the wearable MR platform HoloLens® for 36 paediatric heart team members who filled out a diagnostic and quality rating questionnaire. Morphological and diagnostic output from the hologram was assessed and the 3D experience was evaluated. Locally developed app tools such as hologram rotation, scaling, and cutting were rated. Anatomy identification and diagnostic output was high as well as rating of 3D experience. Younger and female users rated the app tools higher.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This preliminary study demonstrates that MR holograms as surgical planning tool for congenital heart disease may have a high diagnostic value and contribute to understanding complex morphology. The first users experience of the hologram presentation was found to be very positive, with a preference among the female and the younger users. There is potential for improvement of the hologram manipulation tools.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30534951/,2022-11-27 11:28:34 PM
Perceived user preferences and usability evaluation of mainstream wearable devices for health monitoring,"Yuxi Jia, Wei Wang, Dong Wen, Lizhong Liang, Li Gao, Jianbo Lei, Yuxi Jia, Wei Wang, Dong Wen, Lizhong Liang, Li Gao, Jianbo Lei",2018 Jul 25,"Background:
        
      
      There are many problems with fitness trackers, such as device usability, which limit their large-scale application, and relevant studies are limited in terms of their sample size and evaluation methods. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the perceived usability of various mainstream fitness trackers on the market, and to learn about user feedback on feature preferences for each device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Trial use of seven mainstream fitness trackers (two smart watches and five smart wristbands) followed by a survey study were applied. The questionnaire was specifically developed for this study, which included two parts (user preferences and device usability in five dimensions). We recruited users to test the devices for at least 30 days and asked experienced users to provide feedback in order to evaluate each device, including the rating and user preference of each device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We received 388 valid questionnaires, in which users rated their responses on a five-point Likert scale. (1) User preference: the average user satisfaction was 3.50-3.86 (points), and the rating for willingness to buy averaged between 3.36 and 3.59. More users were willing to wear (58.3-81.3%) and purchase (56.8-83.0%) the devices than were not. The top three general feature preferences were daily activity tracking, heart health monitoring, and professional fitness tracking. The top three health-related feature preferences were heart rate monitoring, daily pedometer, and professional fitness tracking. (2) Usability evaluation: product design was rated from 3.57 to 4.00; durability, 3.63-4.26; ease of use, 3.70-3.90; added features, 3.30-3.83; and user-rated accuracy, 3.44-3.78. A significant difference was observed in the rating of product design and durability among the different devices (p < 0.05) score.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Users generally had positive subjective intent regarding fitness trackers but were less satisfied with their cost effectiveness. The users preferred health related features such as heart health monitoring, and professional fitness tracking. The rating of most of the current mainstream fitness trackers was fair with some significant differences among the devices. Thus, further improvement is needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30065893/,2022-11-27 11:28:38 PM
"Automatic Mobile Health Arrhythmia Monitoring for the Detection of Atrial Fibrillation: Prospective Feasibility, Accuracy, and User Experience Study","Onni E Santala, Jari Halonen, Susanna Martikainen, Helena Jäntti, Tuomas T Rissanen, Mika P Tarvainen, Tomi P Laitinen, Tiina M Laitinen, Eemu-Samuli Väliaho, Juha E K Hartikainen, Tero J Martikainen, Jukka A Lipponen, Onni E Santala, Jari Halonen, Susanna Martikainen, Helena Jäntti, Tuomas T Rissanen, Mika P Tarvainen, Tomi P Laitinen, Tiina M Laitinen, Eemu-Samuli Väliaho, Juha E K Hartikainen, Tero J Martikainen, Jukka A Lipponen",2021 Oct 22,"Background:
        
      
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common tachyarrhythmia and associated with a risk of stroke. The detection and diagnosis of AF represent a major clinical challenge due to AF's asymptomatic and intermittent nature. Novel consumer-grade mobile health (mHealth) products with automatic arrhythmia detection could be an option for long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-based rhythm monitoring and AF detection.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of a wearable automated mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, including a consumer-grade, single-lead heart rate belt ECG device (heart belt), a mobile phone application, and a cloud service with an artificial intelligence (AI) arrhythmia detection algorithm for AF detection. The specific aim of this proof-of-concept study was to test the feasibility of the entire sequence of operations from ECG recording to AI arrhythmia analysis and ultimately to final AF detection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients (n=159) with an AF (n=73) or sinus rhythm (n=86) were recruited from the emergency department. A single-lead heart belt ECG was recorded for 24 hours. Simultaneously registered 3-lead ECGs (Holter) served as the gold standard for the final rhythm diagnostics and as a reference device in a user experience survey with patients over 65 years of age (high-risk group).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The heart belt provided a high-quality ECG recording for visual interpretation resulting in 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AF detection. The accuracy of AF detection with the automatic AI arrhythmia detection from the heart belt ECG recording was also high (97.5%), and the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 95.4%, respectively. The correlation between the automatic estimated AF burden and the true AF burden from Holter recording was >0.99 with a mean burden error of 0.05 (SD 0.26) hours. The heart belt demonstrated good user experience and did not significantly interfere with the patient's daily activities. The patients preferred the heart belt over Holter ECG for rhythm monitoring (85/110, 77% heart belt vs 77/109, 71% Holter, P=.049).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A consumer-grade, single-lead ECG heart belt provided good-quality ECG for rhythm diagnosis. The mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, consisting of heart-belt ECG, a mobile phone application, and an automated AF detection achieved AF detection with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, the mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system showed good user experience.

Technology-Mediated Experiences and Social Context: Relevant Needs in Private Vs. Public Interaction and the Importance of Others for Positive Affect,"Pia von Terzi, Stefan Tretter, Alarith Uhde, Marc Hassenzahl, Sarah Diefenbach, Pia von Terzi, Stefan Tretter, Alarith Uhde, Marc Hassenzahl, Sarah Diefenbach",2021 Sep 1,"Technologies, such as smartphones or wearables, take a central role in our daily lives. Making their use meaningful and enjoyable requires a better understanding of the prerequisites and underpinnings of positive experiences with such technologies. So far, a focus had been on the users themselves, that is, their individual goals, desires, feelings, and acceptance. However, technology is often used in a social context, observed by others or even used in interaction with others, and thus shapes social dynamics considerably. In the present paper, we start from the notion that meaningful and/or enjoyable experiences (i.e., wellbeing) are a major outcome of technology use. We investigate how these experiences are further shaped by social context, such as potential spectators. More specifically, we gathered private (while being alone) and public (while other people are present) positive experiences with technology and compared need fulfillment and affective experience. In addition, we asked participants to imagine a change in context (from private to public or public to private) and to report the impact of this change on experience. Results support the idea of particular social needs, such as relatedness and popularity, which are especially relevant and better fulfilled in public than in private contexts. Moreover, our findings show that participants experience less positive affect when imaginatively removing the present others from a formerly public interaction, i.e., when they imagine performing the same interaction but without the other people present. Overall, this underlines the importance of social context for Human-Computer Interaction practice and research. Practical implications relate to product development, e.g., designing interactive technologies that can adapt to context (changes) or allow for context-sensitive interaction sets. We discuss limitations related to the experimental exploration of social context, such as the method of data collection, as well as potential alternatives to address those limitations, such as diary studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34539519/,2022-11-27 11:28:42 PM
"Using wearables to promote physical activity in old age : Feasibility, benefits, and user friendliness","Laura I Schmidt, Carl-Philipp Jansen, Johanna Depenbusch, Martina Gabrian, Monika Sieverding, Hans-Werner Wahl, Laura I Schmidt, Carl-Philipp Jansen, Johanna Depenbusch, Martina Gabrian, Monika Sieverding, Hans-Werner Wahl",2022 Aug,"Background:
        
      
      Wearables provide new opportunities to promote physical activity also among older adults but data on effectiveness and user friendliness are rare.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The effects of a comprehensive self-regulative intervention on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and number of steps were examined using commercially available activity trackers. Acceptance regarding the devices was analysed in various domains.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this study 80 older adults (mean = 67.03 years, standard deviation = 3.97 years; 59% women) wore a Fitbit Charge HR for 21 days including a baseline, a postintervention and a follow-up week. The intervention comprised feedback, goal setting and planning and 50% of the participants were additionally randomized to a role model component. Social cognitive predictors based on the health action process approach (HAPA) and user experience were assessed via questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The MVPA increased by an average of 19 min per week and steps by 1317 per day. An additional benefit of the role model component could be observed for MVPA. In the follow-up, the intervention effect was still significant for the number of steps, while MVPA dropped back to baseline. Multilevel models including HAPA variables explained small but significant amounts of variance in MVPA (8% within-person, 26% between-person) and steps (11% within-person, 12% between-person). User experience was rated as very high.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Providing an intervention based on established behavior change techniques and self-monitoring via wearables seems to be effective for increasing physical activity among older adults. The HAPA variables seem to play a limited role to explain activity levels. Acceptance of wearables can be expected to be high.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35849158/,2022-11-27 11:28:43 PM
Patient and clinician use characteristics and perceptions of pulse oximeter use: A scoping review,"Tamara Rosic, Neysa Petrina, Melissa Baysari, Angus Ritchie, Simon K Poon, Tamara Rosic, Neysa Petrina, Melissa Baysari, Angus Ritchie, Simon K Poon",2022 Mar 18,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      The need to monitor patients outside of a formal clinical setting, such as a hospital or ambulatory care facility, has become increasingly important since COVID-19. It introduces significant challenges to ensure accurate and timely measurements, maintain strong patient engagement, and operationalise data for clinical decision-making. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) devices like the pulse oximeter help mitigate these difficulties, however, practical approaches to successfully integrate this technology into existing patient-clinician interactions that ensure the delivery of safe and effective care are vital. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesise existing literature to provide an overview of the variety of user perceptions associated with pulse oximeter devices, which may impact patients' and clinicians' acceptance of the devices in a RPM context.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A search over three databases was conducted between April 2021 - June 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A total of 16 articles were included in this scoping review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results indicate there has been an increase in use of pulse oximeters across hospital and community settings for continuous vital signs monitoring and remote monitoring of patients over time. Research in this area is shifting towards increasing accessibility of care through the development and implementation of telehealth systems and phone oximeters. Aspects of pulse oximeter UX most frequently investigated are usability and acceptability, however, these terms are often undefined, or definitions vary across studies. Perceived effectiveness, opportunity costs, and attitude towards use remain unexplored areas of UX. Overall, patients and clinicians view the pulse oximeter positively and find it user-friendly. A high level of learnability was found for the device and additional benefits included increasing patient self-efficacy and clinician motivation to work. However, issues getting an accurate reading due to device usability are still experienced by some patients and clinicians.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This scoping review is the first to summarise user perceptions of the pulse oximeter in a healthcare context. It showed that both patients and clinicians hold positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter and important factors to consider in designing user-focused services include ease-of-use and wearability of devices; context of use including user's prior health and IT knowledge; attitude towards use and perceived effectiveness; impact on user motivation and self-efficacy; and finally, potential user costs like inconvenience or increased anxiety. With the rapid increase in research studies examining pulse oximeter use for RPM since COVID-19, a systematic review is warranted as the next step to consolidate evidence and investigate the impact of these factors on pulse oximeter acceptance and effectiveness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35325661/,2022-11-27 11:28:44 PM
Testing for Wearability and Reliability of TPU Lamination Method in E-Textiles,"Paula Veske, Frederick Bossuyt, Jan Vanfleteren, Paula Veske, Frederick Bossuyt, Jan Vanfleteren",2021 Dec 27,"Electronic textiles (e-textiles) and wearable computing have been emerging increasingly during the last decade. Since the market interest and predictions have grown, the research into increasing reliability and durability of wearables and e-textiles is developing rapidly. The washability of different integration methods and resistance to mechanical stress are the main obstacles being tackled. However, the freedom of movement and overall comfort is still often overlooked during the development phase. It is essential to see the e-textile product as a whole and consider several aspects of user experience. This work will focus on developing and improving the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) lamination integration method for e-textiles.

A Biofeedback App for Migraine: Development and Usability Study,"Sigrid Hegna Ingvaldsen, Erling Tronvik, Eiliv Brenner, Ingunn Winnberg, Alexander Olsen, Gøril Bruvik Gravdahl, Anker Stubberud, Sigrid Hegna Ingvaldsen, Erling Tronvik, Eiliv Brenner, Ingunn Winnberg, Alexander Olsen, Gøril Bruvik Gravdahl, Anker Stubberud",2021 Jul 28,"Background:
        
      
      Biofeedback is effective in treating migraines. It is believed to have a beneficial effect on autonomous nervous system activity and render individuals resilient to stressors that may trigger a migraine. However, widespread use of biofeedback is hampered by the need for a trained therapist and specialized equipment. Emerging digital health technology, including smartphones and wearables (mHealth), enables new ways of administering biofeedback. Currently, mHealth interventions for migraine appear feasible, but development processes and usability testing remain insufficient.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to evaluate and improve the feasibility and usability of an mHealth biofeedback treatment app for adults with migraine.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a prospective development and usability study, 18 adults with migraine completed a 4-week testing period of self-administered therapist-independent biofeedback treatment consisting of a smartphone app connected to wearable sensors (Cerebri, Nordic Brain Tech AS). The app included biofeedback training, instructions for self-delivery, and a headache diary. Two wearable sensors were used to measure surface electromyographic voltage at the trapezius muscle and peripheral skin temperature and heart rate at the right second fingertip. Participants were instructed to complete a daily headache diary entry and biofeedback session of 10 minutes duration. The testing period was preceded by a preusability expectation interview and succeeded by a postusability experience interview. In addition, an evaluation questionnaire was completed at weeks 2 and 4. Adherence was calculated as the proportion of 10-minute sessions completed within the first 28 days of treatment. Usability and feasibility were analyzed and summarized quantitatively and qualitatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 391 biofeedback sessions were completed with a median of 25 (IQR 17-28) per participant. The mean adherence rate was 0.76 (SD 0.26). The evaluation questionnaire revealed that functionality and design had the highest scores, whereas engagement and biofeedback were lower. Qualitative preexpectation analysis revealed that participants expected to become better familiar with physical signals and gain more understanding of their migraine attacks and noted that the app should be simple and understandable. Postusability analysis indicated that participants had an overall positive user experience with some suggestions for improvement regarding the design of the wearables and app content. The intervention was safe and tolerable. One case of prespecified adverse events was recorded in which a patient developed a skin rash from the sticky surface electromyography electrodes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The app underwent a rigorous development process that indicated an overall positive user experience, good usability, and high adherence rate. This study highlights the value of usability testing in the development of mHealth apps.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34319243/,2022-11-27 11:28:45 PM
Wellbeing in the Making: Peoples' Experiences with Wearable Activity Trackers,"Evangelos Karapanos, Rúben Gouveia, Marc Hassenzahl, Jodi Forlizzi, Evangelos Karapanos, Rúben Gouveia, Marc Hassenzahl, Jodi Forlizzi",2016,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers have become a viable business opportunity. Nevertheless, research has raised concerns over their potentially detrimental effects on wellbeing. For example, a recent study found that while counting steps with a pedometer increased steps taken throughout the day, at the same time it decreased the enjoyment people derived from walking. This poses a serious threat to the incorporation of healthy routines into everyday life. Most studies aim at proving the effectiveness of activity trackers. In contrast, a wellbeing-oriented perspective calls for a deeper understanding of how trackers create and mediate meaningful experiences in everyday life.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We present a study of real life experiences with three wearable activity trackers: Fitbit, Jawbone Up and Nike + Fuelband. Using need fulfillment as a theoretical lens, we study recent, memorable experiences submitted by 133 users of activity trackers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We reveal a two-dimensional structure of users' experience driven by the needs of physical thriving or relatedness. Our qualitative findings further show a nuanced picture of the adoption of activity trackers and their impact on wellbeing. For instance, while reflection about own exercising practices lost its relevance over time, users continued to wear the tracker to document and collect their runs. More than just supporting behavioral change, we find trackers to provide multiple psychological benefits. For instance, they enhance feelings of autonomy as people gain more control about their exercising regime. Others experience relatedness, when family members purchase a tracker for relatives and join them in their efforts towards a better, healthier self.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study highlights that activity trackers can be more than ""tools"" to change behavior. Through incorporation in daily life, they offer new social experiences, new ways of boosting our self-esteem and getting closer to our ideal selves.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27376017/,2022-11-27 11:28:46 PM

Patient-centered activity monitoring in the self-management of chronic health conditions,"Emil Chiauzzi, Carlos Rodarte, Pronabesh DasMahapatra, Emil Chiauzzi, Carlos Rodarte, Pronabesh DasMahapatra",2015 Apr 9,"Background:
        
      
      As activity tracking devices become smaller, cheaper, and more consumer-accessible, they will be used more extensively across a wide variety of contexts. The expansion of activity tracking and personal data collection offers the potential for patient engagement in the management of chronic diseases. Consumer wearable devices for activity tracking have shown promise in post-surgery recovery in cardiac patients, pulmonary rehabilitation, and activity counseling in diabetic patients, among others. Unfortunately, the data generated by wearable devices is seldom integrated into programmatic self-management chronic disease regimens. In addition, there is lack of evidence supporting sustained use or effects on health outcomes, as studies have primarily focused on establishing the feasibility of monitoring activity and the association of measured activity with short-term benefits.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Monitoring devices can make a direct and real-time impact on self-management, but the validity and reliability of measurements need to be established. In order for patients to become engaged in wearable data gathering, key patient-centered issues relating to usefulness in care, motivation, the safety and privacy of information, and clinical integration need to be addressed. Because the successful usage of wearables requires an ability to comprehend and utilize personal health data, the user experience should account for individual differences in numeracy skills and apply evidence-based behavioral science principles to promote continued engagement.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Activity monitoring has the potential to engage patients as advocates in their personalized care, as well as offer health care providers real world assessments of their patients' daily activity patterns. This potential will be realized as the voice of the chronic disease patients is accounted for in the design of devices, measurements are validated against existing clinical assessments, devices become part of the treatment 'prescription', behavior change programs are used to engage patients in self-management, and best practices for clinical integration are defined.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25889598/,2022-11-27 11:28:48 PM
"Evaluation of 1-Year in-Home Monitoring Technology by Home-Dwelling Older Adults, Family Caregivers, and Nurses","Bruno Pais, Philipp Buluschek, Guillaume DuPasquier, Tobias Nef, Narayan Schütz, Hugo Saner, Daniel Gatica-Perez, Valérie Santschi, Bruno Pais, Philipp Buluschek, Guillaume DuPasquier, Tobias Nef, Narayan Schütz, Hugo Saner, Daniel Gatica-Perez, Valérie Santschi",2020 Oct 2,"Introduction: Population aging is increasing the needs and costs of healthcare. Both frailty and the chronic diseases affecting older people reduce their ability to live independently. However, most older people prefer to age in their own homes. New development of in-home monitoring can play a role in staying independent, active, and healthy for older people. This 12-month observational study aimed to evaluate a new in-home monitoring system among home-dwelling older adults (OA), their family caregivers (FC), and nurses for the support of home care. Methods: The in-home monitoring system evaluated in this study continuously monitored OA's daily activities (e.g., mobility, sleep habits, fridge visits, door events) by ambient sensor system (DomoCare®) and health-related events by wearable sensors (Activity tracker, ECG). In the case of deviations in daily activities, alerts were transmitted to nurses via email. Using specific questionnaires, the opinions of 13 OA, 13 FC, and 20 nurses were collected at the end of 12-months follow-up focusing on user experience and the impact of in-home monitoring on home care services. Results: The majority of OA, FC, and nurses considered that in-home sensors can help with staying at home, improving home care and quality of life, preventing domestic accidents, and reducing family stress. The opinion tended to be more frequently favorable toward ambient sensors (76%; 95% CI: 61-87%) than toward wearable sensors (Activity tracker: 65%; 95% CI: 50-79%); ECG: 60%; 95% CI: 45-75%). On average, OA (74%; 95% CI: 46-95%) and FC (70%; 95% CI: 39-91%) tended to be more enthusiastic than nurses (60%; 95% CI: 36-81%). Some barriers reported by nurses were a fear of weakening of the relationship with OA and lack of time.

Determinants for Sustained Use of an Activity Tracker: Observational Study,"Sander Hermsen, Jonas Moons, Peter Kerkhof, Carina Wiekens, Martijn De Groot, Sander Hermsen, Jonas Moons, Peter Kerkhof, Carina Wiekens, Martijn De Groot",2017 Oct 30,"Background:
        
      
      A lack of physical activity is considered to cause 6% of deaths globally. Feedback from wearables such as activity trackers has the potential to encourage daily physical activity. To date, little research is available on the natural development of adherence to activity trackers or on potential factors that predict which users manage to keep using their activity tracker during the first year (and thereby increasing the chance of healthy behavior change) and which users discontinue using their trackers after a short time.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to identify the determinants for sustained use in the first year after purchase. Specifically, we look at the relative importance of demographic and socioeconomic, psychological, health-related, goal-related, technological, user experience-related, and social predictors of feedback device use. Furthermore, this study tests the effect of these predictors on physical activity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 711 participants from four urban areas in France received an activity tracker (Fitbit Zip) and gave permission to use their logged data. Participants filled out three Web-based questionnaires: at start, after 98 days, and after 232 days to measure the aforementioned determinants. Furthermore, for each participant, we collected activity data tracked by their Fitbit tracker for 320 days. We determined the relative importance of all included predictors by using Random Forest, a machine learning analysis technique.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The data showed a slow exponential decay in Fitbit use, with 73.9% (526/711) of participants still tracking after 100 days and 16.0% (114/711) of participants tracking after 320 days. On average, participants used the tracker for 129 days. Most important reasons to quit tracking were technical issues such as empty batteries and broken trackers or lost trackers (21.5% of all Q3 respondents, 130/601). Random Forest analysis of predictors revealed that the most influential determinants were age, user experience-related factors, mobile phone type, household type, perceived effect of the Fitbit tracker, and goal-related factors. We explore the role of those predictors that show meaningful differences in the number of days the tracker was worn.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study offers an overview of the natural development of the use of an activity tracker, as well as the relative importance of a range of determinants from literature. Decay is exponential but slower than may be expected from existing literature. Many factors have a small contribution to sustained use. The most important determinants are technical condition, age, user experience, and goal-related factors. This finding suggests that activity tracking is potentially beneficial for a broad range of target groups, but more attention should be paid to technical and user experience-related aspects of activity trackers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084709/,2022-11-27 11:28:50 PM

The sensor array installed in the detector consists of 14 custom-made bending sensors and an inertial measurement unit with high accuracy. The glove support for a sensor array, which is made of three silicone materials with different elasticity, not only overcomes the drawbacks of cloth support, but also addresses the compatibility between the stretch substrate and the inelastic sensing components. Besides, two-section electrical connection avoids the problems caused by the external wires in traditional solutions to enhance the durability of glove. The experiment results indicated that the wearable detector offers a good user experience by exerting a small force on fingers. The device also shows a strong durability as it worked properly after tens of thousands of bending. The measurement tests on a single sensor demonstrated that two kinds of sensors are both with high accuracy. Besides, the hand goniometric system has an excellent performance in terms of hand motion detection. The measurement error of the device in subjects with different hand sizes is within a reasonable range. The good properties of the sensory detector allow it to be applied in clinical applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29877827/,2022-11-27 11:28:51 PM
Psychosocial impacts of hybrid closed-loop systems in the management of diabetes: a review,"C Farrington, C Farrington",2018 Apr,"There is a pressing need for new treatment regimens that enable improved glycaemic control and reduced diabetes self-management burdens. Closed-loop, or artificial pancreas, systems represent one of the most promising avenues in this regard. Closed-loop systems connect wearable continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors to smartphone- or tablet-mounted algorithms that process and model CGM data to deliver precise and frequently updated doses of fast-acting insulin (and glucagon in dual-hormone systems) to users via wearable pumps. Recent studies have demonstrated that closed-loop systems offer significant benefit in terms of improved glycaemic control. However, less attention has been paid to the psychosocial impact on users of closed-loop systems. This article reviews recent research on psychosocial aspects of closed-loop usage in light of preceding research on user experience of currently available technologies such as insulin pumps and CGM sensors. The small, but growing body of research in this field reports generally positive user experience and a number of experienced benefits including: reassurance and reduced anxiety, improved sleep and confidence, and 'time off' from diabetes demands. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by important challenges, ranging from variable levels of trust to concerns about physical bulk, technical glitches and difficulties incorporating closed-loop systems into everyday life. Future research should explore psychosocial aspects of closed-loop usage in more diverse groups and with regard to clinicians, as well as users, to ensure that the clinical benefits of closed-loop systems are realized at scale in routine medical care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29247547/,2022-11-27 11:28:51 PM

Attention to human factors and comfort of these devices can greatly positively influence user experience, with a subsequently higher likelihood of user acceptance and lower levels of device rejection. Here, we employ a human factors and comfort assessment methodology grounded in the principles of human-centered design to influence and enhance the design of an instrumented insole. A use case was developed and interrogated by stakeholders, experts, and end users, capturing the context of use and user characteristics for the instrumented insole. This use case informed all stages of the design process through two full design cycles, leading to the development of an initial version 1 and a later version 2 prototype. Each version of the prototype was subjected to an expert human factors inspection and controlled comfort assessment using human volunteers. Structured feedback from the first cycle of testing was the driver of design changes implemented in the version 2 prototype. This prototype was found to have significantly improved human factors and comfort characteristics over the first version of the prototype. Expert inspection found that many of the original problems in the first prototype had been resolved in the second prototype. Furthermore, a comfort assessment of this prototype with a group of young healthy adults showed it to be indistinguishable from their normal footwear.

Persuasive Design Techniques and App Design Recommendations to Improve Health Workforce Capability in Rural Health Professionals: What Do Users Want and How Does an App Help?,"Sabrina Pit, Robyn Ramsden, Aaron Jh Tan, Kristy Payne, James Barr, Benjamin Eames, Mike Edwards, Richard Colbran, Sabrina Pit, Robyn Ramsden, Aaron Jh Tan, Kristy Payne, James Barr, Benjamin Eames, Mike Edwards, Richard Colbran",2022 May 2,"Background:
        
      
      Health professionals' perceptions of persuasive design techniques for use in technological solutions to improve health workforce capability have not been previously explored.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to explore rural health professionals' perceptions of health workforce capability and persuasive design techniques; and translate these into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase their impact and usefulness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Qualitative interviews with 13 rural health professionals were conducted. Subsequently, 32 persuasive techniques were used as a framework to deductively analyze the data. Persuasive design technique domains were Primary Task Support, Dialog Support, System Credibility Support, Social Support, and Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Persuasive design techniques can be applied across the factors that influence health workforce capability including health and personal qualities; competencies and skills; values, attitudes, and motivation; and factors that operate outside of work and at the team, organizational, and labor market levels. The majority of the 32 persuasive design techniques were reflected in the data from the interviews and led to recommendations as to how these could be translated into practice, with the exception of scarcity. Many suggestions and persuasive design techniques link back to the need for tailored and localized solutions such as the need for country-specific-based evidence, the wish for localized communities of practice, learning from other rural health professionals, and referral pathways to other clinicians. Participants identified how persuasive design techniques can optimize the user experience to help meet rural health professionals needs for more efficient systems to improve patient access to care, quality care, and to enable working in interprofessional team-based care. Social inclusion plays a vital role for health professionals, indicating the importance of the Social Support domain of persuasive techniques. Overall, health professionals were open to self-monitoring of their work performance and some professionals used wearables to monitor their health.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Rural health professionals' perceptions of health workforce capability informed which persuasive design techniques can be used to optimize the user experience of an app. These were translated into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase likelihood of adoption. This study has also contributed to the further validation of the Persuasive Systems Design model through empirically aligning elements of the model to increase persuasive system content and functionality with real-world applied data, in this case the health workforce capability of rural health professionals. Our findings confirm that these techniques can be used to develop a future prototype of an app that may assist health professionals in improving or maintaining their health workforce capability which in turn may increase recruitment and retention in rural areas. Health professionals need to be central during the design phase. Interventions are needed to provide a supportive environment to rural and remote health professionals to increase their rural health workforce capability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35499866/,2022-11-27 11:28:56 PM

""" I Must Try Harder"": Design Implications for Mobile Apps and Wearables Contributing to Self-Efficacy of Patients With Chronic Conditions","Sharon Wulfovich, Maddalena Fiordelli, Homero Rivas, Waldo Concepcion, Katarzyna Wac, Sharon Wulfovich, Maddalena Fiordelli, Homero Rivas, Waldo Concepcion, Katarzyna Wac",2019 Oct 23,"Background:
        
      
      Diverse wellness-promoting mobile health technologies, including mobile apps and wearable trackers, became increasingly popular due to their ability to support patients' self-management of health conditions. However, the patient's acceptance and use depend on the perceived experience and the app appropriateness to the patient's context and needs. We have some understating of the experience and factors influencing the use of these technologies in the general public, but we have a limited understanding of these issues in patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      By presenting results from an explorative study, this paper aims to identify implications for the design of mobile apps and wearables to effectively support patients' efforts in self-management of health with a special emphasis on support for self-efficacy of activities contributing to health.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An explorative mixed-method study involving 200 chronically ill patients of Stanford Medical Center (Stanford, CA, United States) was conducted between mid-2016 and end of 2018. Amongst these, 20 patients were involved in a 4-weeks study, in which we collected the underlying wearable device use logs (e.g., Fitbit) and subjective use experience [via an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)], as well as patients' momentary perception of general self-efficacy in their natural environments and different daily contexts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results indicate that mobile apps for health and wearables have the potential to enable better self-management and improve patients' wellbeing but must be further refined to address different human aspects of their use. Specifically, the apps/wearables should be easier to use, more personalized and context-aware for the patient's overall routine and lifestyle choices, as well as with respect to the momentary patient state (e.g., location, type of people around) and health(care) needs. Additionally, apps and devices should be more battery efficient and accurate; providing timely, non-judgmental feedback and personalized advice to the patients anywhere-anytime-anyhow. These results are mapped on major sources of the individuals' self-efficacy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results show how the apps/wearables that are aimed at supporting the patients' self-management should be designed to leverage and further improve the patients' general self-efficacy and self-efficacy of activities contributing to chronic disease management.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31749733/,2022-11-27 11:28:57 PM

High-Stability Flexible X-ray Detectors Based on Lead-Free Halide Perovskite Cs2TeI6 Films,"Jun Guo, Yadong Xu, Wenhui Yang, Bao Xiao, Qihao Sun, Xinlei Zhang, Binbin Zhang, Menghua Zhu, Wanqi Jie, Jun Guo, Yadong Xu, Wenhui Yang, Bao Xiao, Qihao Sun, Xinlei Zhang, Binbin Zhang, Menghua Zhu, Wanqi Jie",2021 May 26,"Normal flat panel X-ray detectors are confined in imaging of curved surfaces and three-dimensional objects. Except that, their rigid panels provide uncomfortable user experience in medical diagnosis. Here, we report a flexible X-ray detector fabricated by the combination of a lead-free Cs2TeI6 perovskite film and a polyimide (PI) substrate. High-quality Cs2TeI6 polycrystalline films are prepared by a low-temperature electrospraying method. The resistivity even remained at the level of 1011 Ω·cm after 100 cycles of bending tests with a low bending radius of 10 mm. The resulting flexible Cs2TeI6 detectors exhibit better response stability than those based on rigid SnO2:F glass (FTO), which is attributed to the superior crystallization of films and the growth stress relief of flexible substrates. Furthermore, an X-ray sensitivity of 76.27 μC·Gyair-1·cm-2 and a detection limit of 0.17 μGyair·s-1 are achieved. A series of distortion-free clear X-ray images are obtained for objects with different materials and densities. These findings provide insights into flexible X-ray detectors based on perovskite films and motivate research in wearable X-ray detectors for medical radiography and dose monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33999604/,2022-11-27 11:28:58 PM
Body-Worn Sensors for Parkinson's disease: A qualitative approach with patients and healthcare professionals,"Clara Virbel-Fleischman, Yann Rétory, Sébastien Hardy, Camille Huiban, Jean-Christophe Corvol, David Grabli, Clara Virbel-Fleischman, Yann Rétory, Sébastien Hardy, Camille Huiban, Jean-Christophe Corvol, David Grabli",2022 May 5,"Body-Worn Sensors (BWS) provide reliable objective and continuous assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms, but their implementation in clinical routine has not yet become widespread. Users' perceptions of BWS have not been explored. This study intended to evaluate the usability, user experience (UX), patients' perceptions of BWS, and health professionals' (HP) opinions on BWS monitoring. A qualitative analysis was performed from semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 patients and 9 HP experts in PD. Patients completed two interviews before and after the BWS one-week experiment, and they answered two questionnaires assessing the usability and UX. Patients rated the three BWS usability with high scores (SUS median [range]: 87.5 [72.5-100]). The UX across all dimensions of their interaction with the BWS was positive. During interviews, all patients and HP expressed interest in BWS monitoring. Patients' hopes and expectations increased the more they learned about BWS. They manifested enthusiasm to wear BWS, which they imagined could improve their PD symptoms. HP highlighted needs for logistical support in the implementation of BWS in their practice. Both patients and HP suggested possible uses of BWS monitoring in clinical practice, for treatment adjustments for example, or for research purposes. Patients and HP shared ideas about the use of BWS monitoring, although patients may be more likely to integrate BWS into their disease follow-up compared to HP in their practice.

      To develop and prospectively evaluate a method of epileptic seizure detection combining heart rate and movement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this multicenter, in-home, prospective, video-controlled cohort study, nocturnal seizures were detected by heart rate (photoplethysmography) or movement (3-D accelerometry) in persons with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Participants with >1 monthly major seizure wore a bracelet (Nightwatch) on the upper arm at night for 2 to 3 months. Major seizures were tonic-clonic, generalized tonic >30 seconds, hyperkinetic, or others, including clusters (>30 minutes) of short myoclonic/tonic seizures. The video of all events (alarms, nurse diaries) and 10% completely screened nights were reviewed to classify major (needing an alarm), minor (needing no alarm), or no seizure. Reliability was tested by interobserver agreement. We determined device performance, compared it to a bed sensor (Emfit), and evaluated the caregivers' user experience.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-eight of 34 admitted participants (1,826 nights, 809 major seizures) completed the study. Interobserver agreement (major/no major seizures) was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.89). Median sensitivity per participant amounted to 86% (95% CI 77%-93%); the false-negative alarm rate was 0.03 per night (95% CI 0.01-0.05); and the positive predictive value was 49% (95% CI 33%-64%). The multimodal sensor showed a better sensitivity than the bed sensor (n = 14, median difference 58%, 95% CI 39%-80%, p < 0.001). The caregivers' questionnaire (n = 33) indicated good sensor acceptance and usability according to 28 and 27 participants, respectively.

Low-complexity prediction of frequency-rich biosignals for lossless compression in wearable technologies,"Guangwei Chen, Stuart A Bowyer, Esther Rodriguez-Villegas, Guangwei Chen, Stuart A Bowyer, Esther Rodriguez-Villegas",2016 Aug,"Wearable technologies that store, monitor and analyse a range of biosignals are an area of significant growth and interest for both industry and academia. The rate of data generation in these devices poses a considerable challenge with regards to the bandwidths of wireless transmission protocols, local storage capacities and the on-board power consumption requirements. This issue is particularly acute for frequency-rich biosignals containing significant higher frequency components that are un-served by conventional compression techniques. This paper proposes a low-complexity predictor, based on a low-order infinite impulse response bandpass filter, to accurately predict such biosignals for use in lossless compression. Experimental evaluation of the method demonstrates that it outperforms conventional predictors with an average 25 % reduction in predictor residual standard deviation. The predictor described here enables high-bandwidth wearable sensors that can be employed in systems with reduced power consumption for transmission, storage and compression leading to considerable improvements in user experience by reducing device mass and increasing battery life.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28269061/,2022-11-27 11:29:02 PM
"Usability, Acceptability, and Satisfaction of a Wearable Activity Tracker in Older Adults: Observational Study in a Real-Life Context in Northern Portugal","Célia Domingos, Patrício Costa, Nadine Correia Santos, José Miguel Pêgo, Célia Domingos, Patrício Costa, Nadine Correia Santos, José Miguel Pêgo",2022 Jan 26,"Background:
        
      
      The use of activity trackers has significantly increased over the last few years. This technology has the potential to improve the levels of physical activity and health-related behaviors in older adults. However, despite the potential benefits, the rate of adoption remains low among older adults. Therefore, understanding how technology is perceived may potentially offer insight to promote its use.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to (1) assess acceptability, usability, and user satisfaction with the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 in Portuguese community-dwelling older adults in a real-world context; (2) explore the mediating effect of the usability on the relationship between user characteristics and satisfaction; and (3) examine the moderating effect of user characteristics on the relationship between usability and user satisfaction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Older adults used the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 over 15 days. The user experience was evaluated through the Technology Acceptance Model 3, System Usability Scale, and User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire. An integrated framework for usability and user satisfaction was used to explore user experience. Statistical data analysis included descriptive data analysis, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and mediation and moderation analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A sample of 110 older adults with an average age of 68.41 years (SD 3.11) completed the user experience questionnaires. Mean user acceptance was very high-perceived ease of use: 6.45 (SD 0.78); perceptions of external control: 6.74 (SD 0.55); computer anxiety: 6.85 (SD 0.47); and behavioral intention: 6.60 (SD 0.97). The usability was excellent with an average score of 92.70 (SD 10.73), and user satisfaction was classified as a good experience 23.30 (SD 2.40). The mediation analysis confirmed the direct positive effect of usability on satisfaction (β=.530; P<.01) and the direct negative effect of depression on usability (β=-.369; P<.01). Lastly, the indirect effect of usability on user satisfaction was higher in individuals with lower Geriatric Depression Scale levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Findings demonstrate that the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is suitable for older adults.

The dry electrode was fabricated in our laboratory. It was designed as claw-like structure with a diameter of 14 mm, featuring 8 small fingers of 6 mm length and 2 mm diameter. The structure and elasticity can help the fingers pass through the hair and contact the scalp when the electrode is placed on head. The electrode was capable of recording spontaneous EEG and evoked brain activities such as SSVEP with high signal-to-noise ratio. This study implemented a twelve-class SSVEP-based BCI system with eight electrodes embedded in a headband. Subjects also completed a comfort level questionnaire with the dry electrodes. Using a preprocessing algorithm of filter bank analysis (FBA) and a classification algorithm based on task-related component analysis (TRCA), the average classification accuracy of eleven participants was 93.2% using 1-second-long SSVEPs, leading to an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 92.35 bits/min. All subjects did not report obvious discomfort with the dry electrodes. This result represented the highest communication speed in the dry-electrode based BCI systems.

However, to realize the industrialization of e-skin, two factors must be optimized. The first is to achieve high comfort, which can significantly improve the user experience. The second is to make the e-skin intelligent, so it can detect and analyze physiological signals at the same time. In this article, intelligent and multifunctional e-skin consisting of laser-scribed graphene and polyurethane (PU) nanomesh is realized with high comfort. The e-skin can be used as a strain sensor with large measurement range (>60%), good sensitivity (GF≈40), high linearity range (60%), and excellent stability (>1000 cycles). By analyzing the morphology of e-skin, a parallel networks model is proposed to express the mechanism of the strain sensor. In addition, laser scribing is also applied to etch the insulating PU, which greatly decreases the impedance in detecting electrophysiology signals. Finally, the e-skin is applied to monitor the electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrooculogram signals. A time- and frequency-domain concatenated convolution neural network is built to analyze the EEG signal detected using the e-skin on the forehead and classify the attention level of testers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882950/,2022-11-27 11:29:04 PM
HoloUS: Augmented reality visualization of live ultrasound images using HoloLens for ultrasound-guided procedures,"Trong Nguyen, William Plishker, Andrew Matisoff, Karun Sharma, Raj Shekhar, Trong Nguyen, William Plishker, Andrew Matisoff, Karun Sharma, Raj Shekhar",2022 Feb,"Purpose:
        
      
      Microsoft HoloLens is a pair of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses that could improve the intraprocedural visualization of ultrasound-guided procedures. With the wearable HoloLens headset, an ultrasound image can be virtually rendered and registered with the ultrasound transducer and placed directly in the practitioner's field of view.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A custom application, called HoloUS, was developed using the HoloLens and a portable ultrasound machine connected through a wireless network. A custom 3D-printed case with an AR-pattern for the ultrasound transducer permitted ultrasound image tracking and registration. Voice controls on the HoloLens supported the scaling and movement of the ultrasound image as desired. The ultrasound images were streamed and displayed in real-time. A user study was performed to assess the effectiveness of the HoloLens as an alternative display platform. Novices and experts were timed on tasks involving targeting simulated vessels using a needle in a custom phantom.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Technical characterization of the HoloUS app was conducted using frame rate, tracking accuracy, and latency as performance metrics. The app ran at 25 frames/s, had an 80-ms latency, and could track the transducer with an average reprojection error of 0.0435 pixels. With AR visualization, the novices' times improved by 17% but the experts' times decreased slightly by 5%, which may reflect the experts' training and experience bias.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The HoloUS application was found to enhance user experience and simplify hand-eye coordination. By eliminating the need to alternately observe the patient and the ultrasound images presented on a separate monitor, the proposed AR application has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34817764/,2022-11-27 11:29:05 PM
Smart Offloading Boot System for Remote Patient Monitoring: Toward Adherence Reinforcement and Proper Physical Activity Prescription for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Patients,"Catherine Park, Ramkinker Mishra, Davide Vigano, Maurizio Macagno, Stefano Rossotti, Karen D'Huyvetter, Jason Garcia, David G Armstrong, Bijan Najafi, Catherine Park, Ramkinker Mishra, Davide Vigano, Maurizio Macagno, Stefano Rossotti, Karen D'Huyvetter, Jason Garcia, David G Armstrong, Bijan Najafi",2022 Jan 20,"Background:
        
      
      A critical factor in healing diabetic foot ulcers is patient adherence to offloading devices. We tested a smart offloading boot (SmartBoot) combined with a smartwatch app and cloud dashboard to remotely monitor patient adherence and activity. In addition, the impact of SmartBoot on balance, gait, and user experience was investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fourteen volunteers (31.6±8.7 years; 64% female) performed natural activities (eg, sitting, standing, walking) with and without the SmartBoot for approximately 30 minutes. All participants completed balance tests, 10-meter walking tests at slow, normal, and fast pace while wearing the SmartBoot, and a user experience questionnaire. The accuracy of real-time adherence reporting was assessed by comparing the SmartBoot and staff observation. Center of mass (COM) sway and step counts were measured using a validated wearable system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adherence and non-adherence were 90.6%, 88.0%, and 89.3%, respectively. The COM sway area was significantly smaller with the SmartBoot than without the SmartBoot regardless of test condition. Step count error was 4.4% for slow waking, 36.2% for normal walking, 16.0% for fast walking. Most participants agreed that the SmartBoot is easy to use, relatively comfortable, nonintrusive, and innovative.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this is the first smart offloading system that enables remote patient monitoring and real-time adherence and activity reporting. The SmartBoot enhanced balance performance, likely due to somatosensory feedback. Questionnaire results highlight SmartBoot's technical and clinical potential. Future studies warrant clinical validation of real-time non-adherence alerting to improve wound healing outcomes in people with diabetic foot ulcers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35048739/,2022-11-27 11:29:06 PM
Sustained Acoustic Medicine Combined with A Diclofenac Ultrasound Coupling Patch for the Rapid Symptomatic Relief of Knee Osteoarthritis: Multi-Site Clinical Efficacy Study,"Alex Madzia, Chirag Agrawal, Paddy Jarit, Stephanie Petterson, Kevin Plancher, Ralph Ortiz, Alex Madzia, Chirag Agrawal, Paddy Jarit, Stephanie Petterson, Kevin Plancher, Ralph Ortiz",2020,"Background:
        
      
      Sustained Acoustic Medicine (SAM) is an emerging, non-invasive, non-narcotic, home-use ultrasound therapy for the daily treatment of joint pain. The aim of this multi-site clinical study was to examine the efficacy of long-duration continuous ultrasound combined with a 1% diclofenac ultrasound gel patch in treating pain and improving function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) were followed. Thirty-two (32) patients (18-males, 14-females) 54 years of average age with moderate to severe knee pain and radiographically confirmed knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade II/III) were enrolled for treatment with the SAM device and diclofenac patch applied daily to the treated knee. SAM ultrasound (3 MHz, 0.132 W/cm2, 1.3 W) and 6 grams of 1% diclofenac were applied with a wearable device for 4 hours daily for 1 week, delivering 18,720 Joules of ultrasound energy per treatment. The primary outcome was the daily change in pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10), which was assessed prior to intervention (baseline, day 1), before and after each daily treatment, and after 1 week of daily treatment (day 7). Rapid responders were classified as those patients exhibiting greater than a 1-point reduction in pain following the first treatment. Change in Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Questionnaire (WOMAC) score from baseline to day 7 was the secondary functional outcome measure. Additionally, a series of daily usability and user experience questions related to devising ease of use, functionality, safety, and effectiveness, were collected. Data were analyzed using t-tests and repeated measure ANOVAs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study had a 94% retention rate, and there were no adverse events or study-related complaints across 224 unique treatment sessions. Rapid responders included 75% of the study population. Patients exhibited a significant mean NRS pain reduction over the 7-day study of 2.06-points (50%) for all subjects (n=32, p<0.001) and 2.96-points (70%) for rapid responders (n=24, p<0.001). The WOMAC functional score significantly improved by 351 points for all subjects (n=32, p<0.001), and 510 points for rapid responders (n=24, p<0.001). Over 95% of patients found the device safe, effective and easy to use, and would continue treatment for their knee OA symptoms.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Sustained Acoustic Medicine combined with 1% topical diclofenac rapidly reduced pain and improved function in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis-related knee pain. The clinical findings suggest that this treatment approach may be used as a conservative, non-invasive treatment option for patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Automated-Entry Patient-Generated Health Data for Chronic Conditions: The Evidence on Health Outcomes [Internet],"Jonathan R. Treadwell, James T. Reston, Benjamin Rouse, Joann Fontanarosa, Neha Patel, Nikhil K. Mull, Jonathan R. Treadwell, James T. Reston, Benjamin Rouse, Joann Fontanarosa, Neha Patel, Nikhil K. Mull",,"Background:
        
      
      Automated-entry consumer devices that collect and transmit patient-generated health data (PGHD) are being evaluated as potential tools to aid in the management of chronic diseases. The need exists to evaluate the evidence regarding consumer PGHD technologies, particularly for devices that have not gone through Food and Drug Administration evaluation.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To summarize the research related to automated-entry consumer health technologies that provide PGHD for the prevention or management of 11 chronic diseases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The project scope was determined through discussions with Key Informants. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (via EMBASE.com), In-Process MEDLINE and PubMed unique content (via PubMed.gov), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews or controlled trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies. We assessed risk of bias and extracted data on health outcomes, surrogate outcomes, usability, sustainability, cost-effectiveness outcomes (quantifying the tradeoffs between health effects and cost), process outcomes, and other characteristics related to PGHD technologies. For isolated effects on health outcomes, we classified the results in one of four categories: (1) likely no effect, (2) unclear, (3) possible positive effect, or (4) likely positive effect. When we categorized the data as “unclear” based solely on health outcomes, we then examined and classified surrogate outcomes for that particular clinical condition.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      We identified 114 unique studies that met inclusion criteria. The largest number of studies addressed patients with hypertension (51 studies) and obesity (43 studies). Eighty-four trials used a single PGHD device, 23 used 2 PGHD devices, and the other 7 used 3 or more PGHD devices. Pedometers, blood pressure (BP) monitors, and scales were commonly used in the same studies. Overall, we found a “possible positive effect” of PGHD interventions on health outcomes for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and asthma. For obesity, we rated the health outcomes as unclear, and the surrogate outcomes (body mass index/weight) as likely no effect. For hypertension, we rated the health outcomes as unclear, and the surrogate outcomes (systolic BP/diastolic BP) as possible positive effect. For cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities we rated the health outcomes as unclear and the surrogate outcome (time to arrhythmia detection) as likely positive effect. The findings were “unclear” regarding PGHD interventions for diabetes prevention, sleep apnea, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most studies did not report harms related to PGHD interventions; the relatively few harms reported were minor and transient, with event rates usually comparable to harms in the control groups. Few studies reported cost-effectiveness analyses, and only for PGHD interventions for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the findings were variable across different chronic conditions and devices. Patient adherence to PGHD interventions was highly variable across studies, but patient acceptance/satisfaction and usability was generally fair to good. However, device engineers independently evaluated consumer wearable and handheld BP monitors and considered the user experience to be poor, while their assessment of smartphone-based electrocardiogram monitors found the user experience to be good. Student volunteers involved in device usability testing of the Weight Watchers Online app found it well-designed and relatively easy to use.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated some PGHD technologies (e.g., pedometers, scales, BP monitors), particularly for obesity and hypertension, but health outcomes were generally underreported. We found evidence suggesting a possible positive effect of PGHD interventions on health outcomes for four chronic conditions. Lack of reporting of health outcomes and insufficient statistical power to assess these outcomes were the main reasons for “unclear” ratings. The majority of studies on PGHD technologies still focus on non-health-related outcomes. Future RCTs should focus on measurement of health outcomes. Furthermore,future RCTs should be designed to isolate the effect of the PGHD intervention from other components in a multicomponent intervention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33724747/,2022-11-27 11:29:07 PM

The purpose of this study was to describe qualitatively the experience of using a personal sleep monitoring device for sleep self-management in adults 65 years or older with self-reported sleep disturbances. This study followed a hybrid qualitative design using deductive and emergent coding derived from open-ended interviews (n = 25) after a period of 4 weeks using a wearable personal sleep monitoring device. Results expanded existing theoretical models on usability with the theme of personal meaning in the interaction between health and self-monitoring technology that were associated with age and technology use, privacy, and capability. Future studies for sleep health self-management and personally tailored interventions using personal sleep monitoring devices should continue to collect qualitative information in extending the understanding of user experience across different symptom clusters, such as sleep disturbances, that manifest more commonly in older age populations.

      This study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators of the user experience of interacting with a virtual care platform and research team, while participating in a fully virtual study using qualitative and quantitative data.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Semistructured interviews were conducted to understand participants' experience of participating in a virtual study during a global pandemic. The schedule included their experience of enrollment and their interactions with equipment and study staff. A total of 3 RiskSEARCH participants were interviewed over telephone, and transcriptions were inductively coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify and describe the factors that influenced study adherence. Quantitative metrics, including adherence to wearable and scheduled tasks collected as part of the RiskSEARCH main study, were paired with the interviews to present an overall picture of participation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All participants exceeded our definition of a fully adherent participant and reported that participation was feasible and had a low burden. The symptoms progressively resolved during the trial. Inductive thematic analysis identified 13 main themes from the interview data, which were deductively mapped onto 11 of the 14 TDF domains, highlighting barriers and facilitators for each.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Participants in the RiskSEARCH substudy showed high levels of adherence and engagement throughout participation. Although participants experienced some challenges in setting up and maintaining the Current Health kit (eg, charging devices), they reported feeling that the requirements of participation were both reasonable and realistic. We demonstrated that the TDF can be used for inductive thematic analysis. We anticipate expanding this work in future virtual studies and trials to identify barriers and enabling factors for implementation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35671408/,2022-11-27 11:29:08 PM
Contrasting the Expectations and Experiences Related to Mobile Health Use for Chronic Pain: Questionnaire Study,"Saba Kheirinejad, Andy Alorwu, Aku Visuri, Simo Hosio, Saba Kheirinejad, Andy Alorwu, Aku Visuri, Simo Hosio",2022 Sep 6,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic pain is a prolonged condition that deteriorates one's quality of life. Treating chronic pain requires a multicomponent approach, and in many cases, there are no ""silver bullet"" solutions. Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly expanding category of solutions in digital health with proven potential in chronic pain management.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to contrast the viewpoints of 2 groups of people with chronic pain concerning mHealth: people who have adopted the use of mHealth and those who have not. We highlight the benefits of mHealth solutions for people with chronic pain and the perceived obstacles to their increased adoption. We also provide recommendations to encourage people to try mHealth solutions as part of their self-care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Prolific crowdsourcing platform was used to collect crowdsourced data. A prescreening questionnaire was released to determine what type of pain potential participants have and whether they are currently using mHealth solutions for chronic pain. The participants were invited based on their experience using mHealth to manage their pain. Similar questions were presented to mHealth users and nonusers. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the outcomes of this study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 31 responses were collected from people (aged 19-63 years, mean 31.4, SD 12.1) with chronic pain who use mHealth solutions. Two-thirds (n=20, 65%) of the users identified as female and 11 (35%) as male. We matched these mHealth users with an equal number of nonusers: 31 responses from the pool of 361 participants in the prescreening questionnaire. The nonusers' ages ranged from 18 to 58 years (mean 30.8, SD 11.09), with 15 (50%) identifying as female and 15 (50%) as male. Likert-scale questions were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test. Results showed that the 2 groups differed significantly on 10 (43%) of 23 questions and shared similar views in the remaining 13 (57%). The most significant differences were related to privacy and interactions with health professionals. Of the 31 mHealth users, 12 (39%) declared that using mHealth solutions has made interacting with health or social care professionals easier (vs n=22, 71%, of nonusers). The majority of the nonusers (n=26, 84%) compared with about half of the users (n=15, 48%) expressed concern about sharing their data with, for example, third parties.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study investigated how mHealth is currently used in the context of chronic pain and what expectations mHealth nonusers have for mHealth as a future chronic pain management tool. Analysis revealed contrasts between mHealth use expectations and actual usage experiences, highlighting privacy concerns toward mHealth solutions. Generally, the results showed that nonusers are more concerned about data privacy and expect mHealth to facilitate interacting with health professionals. The users, in contrast, feel that such connections do not exist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36066960/,2022-11-27 11:29:09 PM
Variability in Reactions to Instructional Guidance during Smartphone-Based Assisted Navigation of Blind Users,"Eshed Ohn-Bar, João Guerreiro, Kris Kitani, Chieko Asakawa, Eshed Ohn-Bar, João Guerreiro, Kris Kitani, Chieko Asakawa",2018 Sep,"'Turn slightly to the left' the navigational system announces, with the aim of directing a blind user to merge into a corridor. Yet, due to long reaction time, the user turns too late and proceeds into the wrong hallway. Observations of such user behavior in real-world navigation settings motivate us to study the manner in which blind users react to the instructional feedback of a turn-by-turn guidance system. We found little previous work analyzing the extent of the variability among blind users in reaction to different instructional guidance during assisted navigation. To gain insight into how navigational interfaces can be better designed to accommodate the information needs of different users, we conduct a data-driven analysis of reaction variability as defined by motion and timing measures. Based on continuously tracked user motion during real-world navigation with a deployed system, we find significant variability between users in their reaction characteristics. Specifically, the statistical analysis reveals significant variability during the crucial elements of the navigation (e.g., turning and encountering obstacles). With the end-user experience in mind, we identify the need to not only adjust interface timing and content to each user's personal walking pace, but also their individual navigation skill and style. The design implications of our study inform the development of assistive systems which consider such user-specific behavior to ensure successful navigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31448356/,2022-11-27 11:29:10 PM
Interactive balance training integrating sensor-based visual feedback of movement performance: a pilot study in older adults,"Michael Schwenk, Gurtej S Grewal, Bahareh Honarvar, Stefanie Schwenk, Jane Mohler, Dharma S Khalsa, Bijan Najafi, Michael Schwenk, Gurtej S Grewal, Bahareh Honarvar, Stefanie Schwenk, Jane Mohler, Dharma S Khalsa, Bijan Najafi",2014 Dec 13,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable sensor technology can accurately measure body motion and provide incentive feedback during exercising. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of a balance training program in older adults integrating data from wearable sensors into a human-computer interface designed for interactive training.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Senior living community residents (mean age 84.6) with confirmed fall risk were randomized to an intervention (IG, n = 17) or control group (CG, n = 16). The IG underwent 4 weeks (twice a week) of balance training including weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks with visual/auditory real-time joint movement feedback using wearable sensors. The CG received no intervention. Outcome measures included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) balance test at baseline and post-intervention. Ankle-hip postural coordination was quantified by a reciprocal compensatory index (RCI). Physical performance was quantified by the Alternate-Step-Test (AST), Timed-up-and-go (TUG), and gait assessment. User experience was measured by a standardized questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After the intervention sway of CoM, hip, and ankle were reduced in the IG compared to the CG during both EO and EC condition (p = .007-.042). Improvement was obtained for AST (p = .037), TUG (p = .024), fast gait speed (p = . 010), but not normal gait speed (p = .264). Effect sizes were moderate for all outcomes. RCI did not change significantly. Users expressed a positive training experience including fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor-feedback.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that older adults at risk of falling can benefit from the balance training program. Study findings may help to inform future exercise interventions integrating wearable sensors for guided game-based training in home- and community environments. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the proposed sensor-based training paradigm compared to traditional balance training programs and commercial exergames.

Applying Mobile Technology to Sustain Physical Activity After Completion of Cardiac Rehabilitation: Acceptability Study,"Abdelaziz Elnaggar, Julia von Oppenfeld, Mary A Whooley, Stephanie Merek, Linda G Park, Abdelaziz Elnaggar, Julia von Oppenfeld, Mary A Whooley, Stephanie Merek, Linda G Park",2021 Sep 2,"Background:
        
      
      Many patients do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity after completing a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. Wearable activity trackers and mobile phone apps are promising potential self-management tools for maintaining physical activity after CR completion.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to evaluate the acceptability of a wearable device, mobile app, and push messages to facilitate physical activity following CR completion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used semistructured interviews to assess the acceptability of various mobile technologies after participation in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Intervention patients in the randomized controlled trial wore the Fitbit Charge 2, used the Movn mobile app, and received push messages on cardiovascular disease prevention and physical activity for over 2 months. We asked 26 intervention group participants for feedback about their experience with the technology and conducted semistructured individual interviews with 7 representative participants. We used thematic analysis to create the main themes from individual interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our sample included participants with a mean age of 66.7 (SD 8.6) years; 23% (6/26) were female. Overall, there were varying levels of satisfaction with different technology components. There were 7 participants who completed the satisfaction questionnaires and participated in the interviews. The Fitbit and Movn mobile app received high satisfaction scores of 4.86 and 4.5, respectively, whereas push messages had a score of 3.14 out of 5. We identified four main themes through the interviews: technology use increased motivation to be physically active, technology use served as a reminder to be physically active, recommendations for technology to improve user experience, and desire for personal feedback.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      By applying a wearable activity tracker, mobile phone app, and push messages, our study showed strong potential for the adoption of new technologies by older adults to maintain physical activity after CR completion. Future research should include a larger sample over a longer period using a mixed methods approach to assess the efficacy of technology use for promoting long-term physical activity behavior in older adults.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34473064/,2022-11-27 11:29:11 PM

This paper presents the development process for a mobile active sports exergame with near-realistic motions through the usage of body-wearable sensors. The process begins by collecting a dataset specifically targeted to mapping real-world activities directly to the games, then, developing the recognition system in a fashion to produce an enjoyable game. The classification algorithm in this paper has precision and recall of 77% and 77% respectively, compared with 40% and 19% precision and recall on current activity monitoring algorithms intended for general daily living activities. Aside from classification, the user experience must be strong enough to be a successful system for adoption. Indeed, fast and intense activities as well as competitive, multiplayer environments make for a successful, enjoyable exergame. This enjoyment is evaluated through a 30 person user study. Multiple aspects of the exergaming user experience trials have been merged into a comprehensive survey, called ExerSurvey. All but one user thought the motions in the game were realistic and difficult to cheat. Ultimately, a game with near-realistic motions was shown to be an enjoyable, active video exergame for any environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24608050/,2022-11-27 11:29:12 PM

Moreover, the ubiquity of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and tablets, can be harnessed to support large-scale self-assessed cognitive screening with benefit to healthcare systems and consumers. A wide variety of apps, wearables, and new digital technologies are either available or in development for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for dementia. Two categories of novel methodologies may be considered: passive technologies (which monitor a user's behavior without active user input) and interactive assessments (which require active user input). Such examinations can be self-administered, supervised by a caregiver, or conducted by an informant at home or outside of a clinical setting. These direct-to-consumer tools have the potential to sidestep barriers associated with cognitive evaluation in primary care, thus improving access to cognitive assessments. Although direct-to-consumer cognitive assessment is associated with its own barriers, including test validation, user experience, and technological concerns, it is conceivable that these issues can be addressed so that a large-scale, self-assessed cognitive evaluation that would represent an initial cognitive screen may be feasible in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32463070/,2022-11-27 11:29:13 PM

The IG underwent balance training (4 wk, twice a week) that included weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing. Real-time visual/audio lower-limb motion feedback was provided from wearable sensors. The CG received no training. User experience was measured by a questionnaire. Postintervention effects on balance (center of mass sway during standing with eyes open [EO] and eyes closed), gait (speed, variability), cognition, and fear of falling were measured. Eleven participants (92%) completed the training and expressed fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor feedback. Sway (EO, p = 0.04) and fear of falling (p = 0.02) were reduced in the IG compared to the CG. Changes in other measures were nonsignificant.

Activity Monitors as Support for Older Persons' Physical Activity in Daily Life: Qualitative Study of the Users' Experiences,"Maria Ehn, Lennie Carlén Eriksson, Nina Åkerberg, Ann-Christin Johansson, Maria Ehn, Lennie Carlén Eriksson, Nina Åkerberg, Ann-Christin Johansson",2018 Feb 1,"Background:
        
      
      Falls are a major threat to the health and independence of seniors. Regular physical activity (PA) can prevent 40% of all fall injuries. The challenge is to motivate and support seniors to be physically active. Persuasive systems can constitute valuable support for persons aiming at establishing and maintaining healthy habits. However, these systems need to support effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) for increasing older adults' PA and meet the senior users' requirements and preferences. Therefore, involving users as codesigners of new systems can be fruitful. Prestudies of the user's experience with similar solutions can facilitate future user-centered design of novel persuasive systems.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to investigate how seniors experience using activity monitors (AMs) as support for PA in daily life. The addressed research questions are as follows: (1) What are the overall experiences of senior persons, of different age and balance function, in using wearable AMs in daily life?; (2) Which aspects did the users perceive relevant to make the measurements as meaningful and useful in the long-term perspective?; and (3) What needs and requirements did the users perceive as more relevant for the activity monitors to be useful in a long-term perspective?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This qualitative interview study included 8 community-dwelling older adults (median age: 83 years). The participants' experiences in using two commercial AMs together with tablet-based apps for 9 days were investigated. Activity diaries during the usage and interviews after the usage were exploited to gather user experience. Comments in diaries were summarized, and interviews were analyzed by inductive content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The users (n=8) perceived that, by using the AMs, their awareness of own PA had increased. However, the AMs' impact on the users' motivation for PA and activity behavior varied between participants. The diaries showed that self-estimated physical effort varied between participants and varied for each individual over time. Additionally, participants reported different types of accomplished activities; talking walks was most frequently reported. To be meaningful, measurements need to provide the user with a reliable receipt of whether his or her current activity behavior is sufficient for reaching an activity goal. Moreover, praise when reaching a goal was described as motivating feedback. To be useful, the devices must be easy to handle. In this study, the users perceived wearables as easy to handle, whereas tablets were perceived difficult to maneuver. Users reported in the diaries that the devices had been functional 78% (58/74) of the total test days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Activity monitors can be valuable for supporting seniors' PA. However, the potential of the solutions for a broader group of seniors can significantly be increased. Areas of improvement include reliability, usability, and content supporting effective BCTs with respect to increasing older adults' PA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29391342/,2022-11-27 11:29:16 PM

       Current near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based systems for continuous flap monitoring are highly sensitive for detecting malperfusion. However, the clinical utility and user experience are limited by the wired connection between the sensor and bedside console. This wire leads to instability of the flap-sensor interface and may cause false alarms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
       We present a novel wearable wireless NIRS sensor for continuous fasciocutaneous free flap monitoring. This waterproof silicone-encapsulated Bluetooth-enabled device contains two light-emitting diodes and two photodetectors in addition to a battery sufficient for 5 days of uninterrupted function. This novel device was compared with a ViOptix T.Ox monitor in a porcine rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap model of arterial and venous occlusions.
    


          Results:
        
      
       Devices were tested in four flaps using three animals. Both devices produced very similar tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) tracings throughout the vascular clamping events, with obvious and parallel changes occurring on arterial clamping, arterial release, venous clamping, and venous release. Small interdevice variations in absolute StO2 value readings and magnitude of change were observed. The normalized cross-correlation at zero lag describing correspondence between the novel NIRS and T.Ox devices was >0.99 in each trial.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
       The wireless NIRS flap monitor is capable of detecting StO2 changes resultant from arterial vascular occlusive events. In this porcine flap model, the functionality of this novel sensor closely mirrored that of the T.Ox wired platform. This device is waterproof, highly adhesive, skin conforming, and has sufficient battery life to function for 5 days. Clinical testing is necessary to determine if this wireless functionality translates into fewer false-positive alarms and a better user experience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34404105/,2022-11-27 11:29:17 PM

At first, they annotated their events at the end of each day; then, after a two-day break, they annotated the data from two days earlier. One group of users had access to both the signal and the contextual information collected by the mobile phone and the other group could only access the biophysiological signal. At the end of the study, the users filled in a system usability scale and user experience surveys.

Day and night comfort and stability on the body of four wearable devices for seizure detection: A direct user-experience,"Elisa Bruno, Andrea Biondi, Sebastian Böttcher, Simon Lees, Andreas Schulze-Bonhage, Mark P Richardson, RADAR-CNS Consortium, Elisa Bruno, Andrea Biondi, Sebastian Böttcher, Simon Lees, Andreas Schulze-Bonhage, Mark P Richardson, RADAR-CNS Consortium",2020 Nov,"Purpose:
        
      
      Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available tool for continuous seizure detection. Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and stable on the body.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the free text of the questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and fifteen participants were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger participants.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33181896/,2022-11-27 11:29:18 PM

Statistical analysis confirms a high correlation of respiratory rate monitoring between the proposed system and a medical-level instrument. This proposed system based on RIP, using a new PDMS-graphene compound tensile sensor can acquire respiratory signal unobtrusively with high accuracy and satisfactory user experience, and thus has great potential in home monitoring scenarios.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31946123/,2022-11-27 11:29:19 PM
The Unfolding Space Glove: A Wearable Spatio-Visual to Haptic Sensory Substitution Device for Blind People,"Jakob Kilian, Alexander Neugebauer, Lasse Scherffig, Siegfried Wahl, Jakob Kilian, Alexander Neugebauer, Lasse Scherffig, Siegfried Wahl",2022 Feb 26,"This paper documents the design, implementation and evaluation of the Unfolding Space Glove-an open source sensory substitution device. It transmits the relative position and distance of nearby objects as vibratory stimuli to the back of the hand and thus enables blind people to haptically explore the depth of their surrounding space, assisting with navigation tasks such as object recognition and wayfinding. The prototype requires no external hardware, is highly portable, operates in all lighting conditions, and provides continuous and immediate feedback-all while being visually unobtrusive. Both blind (n = 8) and blindfolded sighted participants (n = 6) completed structured training and obstacle courses with both the prototype and a white long cane to allow performance comparisons to be drawn between them. The subjects quickly learned how to use the glove and successfully completed all of the trials, though still being slower with it than with the cane. Qualitative interviews revealed a high level of usability and user experience. Overall, the results indicate the general processability of spatial information through sensory substitution using haptic, vibrotactile interfaces. Further research would be required to evaluate the prototype's capabilities after extensive training and to derive a fully functional navigation aid from its features.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35271009/,2022-11-27 11:29:20 PM
Perspectives on the Gamification of an Interactive Health Technology for Postoperative Rehabilitation of Pediatric Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: User-Centered Design Approach,"Michael McClincy, Liliana G Seabol, Michelle Riffitts, Ethan Ruh, Natalie E Novak, Rachel Wasilko, Megan E Hamm, Kevin M Bell, Michael McClincy, Liliana G Seabol, Michelle Riffitts, Ethan Ruh, Natalie E Novak, Rachel Wasilko, Megan E Hamm, Kevin M Bell",2021 Aug 27,"Background:
        
      
      Pediatric and adolescent athletes are a large demographic undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Postoperative rehabilitation is critical, requiring patients to complete home exercise programs (HEPs). To address obstacles to HEP adherence, we developed an interactive health technology, interACTION (iA), to monitor knee-specific rehabilitation. iA is a web-based platform that incorporates wearable motion sensors and a mobile app that provides feedback and allows remote monitoring. The Wheel of Sukr is a gamification mechanism that includes numerous behavioral elements.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to use a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral change strategies derived from self-management theory into iA using the Wheel of Sukr, with the aim of influencing patient behavior.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 10 athletes aged 10-18 years with a history of ACL-R were included in this study. Patients were between 4 weeks and 1 year post-ACL-R. Participants underwent a 60-minute triphasic interview. Phase 1 focused on elements of gaming that led to high participation and information regarding surgery and recovery. In phase 2, participants were asked to think aloud and rank cards representing the components of the Wheel of Sukr in order of interest. In phase 3, the patients reviewed the current version of iA. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked for accuracy. Qualitative content analysis segmented the data and tagged meaningful codes until descriptive redundancy was achieved; next, 2 coders independently coded the data set. These elements were categorized according to the Wheel of Sukr framework. The mean age of participants was 12.8 (SD 1.32) years, and 70% (7/10) were female. Most participants (7/10, 70%) reported attending sessions twice weekly. All patients were prescribed home exercises. Self-reported HEP compliance was 75%-100% in 40% (4/10), 50%-75% in 40% (4/10), and 25%-50% of prescribed exercises in 20% (2/10) of the participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The participants responded positively to an app that could track home exercises. Desirable features included exercise demonstrations, motivational components, and convenience. The participants listed sports specificity, competition, notifications, reminders, rewards, and social aspects of gameplay as features to incorporate. In the Wheel of Sukr card sort exercise, motivation was ranked first; self-management, second; and growth, esteem, and fun tied for the third position. The recommended gameplay components closely followed the themes from the Wheel of Sukr card sort activity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The participants believe iA is a helpful addition to recovery and want the app to include exercise movement tracking and encouragement. Despite the small number of participants, thematic saturation was reached, suggesting the sample was sufficient to obtain a representative range of perspectives. Future work will implement motivation; self-management; and growth, confidence, and fun in the iA user experience. Young athlete ACL-R patients will complete typical clinical scenarios using increasingly developed prototypes of the gamified iA in a controlled setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34448715/,2022-11-27 11:29:20 PM
Acceptability of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Free-Living Healthy Individuals: Implications for the Use of Wearable Biosensors in Diet and Physical Activity Research,"Yue Liao, Susan Schembre, Yue Liao, Susan Schembre",2018 Oct 24,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable sensors have been increasingly used in behavioral research for real-time assessment and intervention purposes. The rapid advancement of biomedical technology typically used in clinical settings has made wearable sensors more accessible to a wider population. Yet the acceptability of this technology for nonclinical purposes has not been examined.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim was to assess the acceptability of wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) device among a sample of nondiabetic individuals, and to compare the acceptability of a CGM between a mobile diet tracking app (MyFitnessPal) and an accelerometer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 30 nondiabetic adults went through a 7-day observational study. They wore a CGM sensor, tracked their diet and physical activity using the CGM receiver and MyFitnessPal, and wore an accelerometer on their waist. After the monitoring period, they completed a 10-item survey regarding acceptability of each of the study tools. Two-tailed paired-sample t tests were conducted to examine whether the summary acceptability scores were comparable between the CGM sensor/receiver and MyFitnessPal/accelerometer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      More than 90% of the study participants agreed that the CGM sensor and receiver were easy to use (28/30 and 27/30, respectively), useful (28/30 and 29/30, respectively), and provided relevant information that was of interest to them (27/30 and 28/30, respectively). The summary acceptability scores (out of a 5-point Likert scale) were mean 4.06 (SD 0.55) for the CGM sensor, mean 4.05 (SD 0.58) for the CGM receiver, mean 4.10 (SD 0.68) for MyFitnessPal, and mean 3.73 (SD 0.76) for the accelerometer.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The high acceptability of using a CGM from this study suggests a great potential for using CGMs in nondiabetic adults in research settings. Although potential selection bias might contribute to the high acceptability in this study, the continued advancements in wearable sensor technology will make the barriers to tracking and collecting personal physiological data more and more minimal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30355561/,2022-11-27 11:29:21 PM
User Experience of 7 Mobile Electroencephalography Devices: Comparative Study,"Thea Radüntz, Beate Meffert, Thea Radüntz, Beate Meffert",2019 Sep 3,"Background:
        
      
      Registration of brain activity has become increasingly popular and offers a way to identify the mental state of the user, prevent inappropriate workload, and control other devices by means of brain-computer interfaces. However, electroencephalography (EEG) is often related to user acceptance issues regarding the measuring technique. Meanwhile, emerging mobile EEG technology offers the possibility of gel-free signal acquisition and wireless signal transmission. Nonetheless, user experience research about the new devices is lacking.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to evaluate user experience aspects of emerging mobile EEG devices and, in particular, to investigate wearing comfort and issues related to emotional design.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We considered 7 mobile EEG devices and compared them for their wearing comfort, type of electrodes, visual appearance, and subjects' preference for daily use. A total of 24 subjects participated in our study and tested every device independently of the others. The devices were selected in a randomized order and worn on consecutive day sessions of 60-min duration. At the end of each session, subjects rated the devices by means of questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results indicated a highly significant change in maximal possible wearing duration among the EEG devices (χ26=40.2, n=24; P<.001). Regarding the visual perception of devices' headset design, results indicated a significant change in the subjects' ratings (χ26=78.7, n=24; P<.001). Results of the subjects' ratings regarding the practicability of the devices indicated highly significant differences among the EEG devices (χ26=83.2, n=24; P<.001). Ranking order and posthoc tests offered more insight and indicated that pin electrodes had the lowest wearing comfort, in particular, when coupled with a rigid, heavy headset. Finally, multiple linear regression for each device separately revealed that users were not willing to accept less comfort for a more attractive headset design.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study offers a differentiated look at emerging mobile and gel-free EEG technology and the relation between user experience aspects and device preference. Our research could be seen as a precondition for the development of usable applications with wearables and contributes to consumer health informatics and health-enabling technologies. Furthermore, our results provided guidance for the technological development direction of new EEG devices related to the aspects of emotional design.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31482852/,2022-11-27 11:29:22 PM
Talking to Toddlers: Drawing on Mothers' Perceptions of Using Wearable and Mobile Technology in the Home,"Dawn Choo, Shani Dettman, Richard Dowell, Robert Cowan, Dawn Choo, Shani Dettman, Richard Dowell, Robert Cowan",2017,"Background:
        
      
      Mother-child interactions often give rise to opportunities for early language learning in the context of everyday life. Persuasive technology has the potential to influence maternal language behaviours in the home and promote mothers' active engagement in the development of their children's communication skills.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      This paper explored maternal perceptions regarding the use of a language tracking wearable (Language Environment Analysis; LENA) device and a parent education smartphone application in an 8-week trial with their young children.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Mother/child dyads were enrolled in a feasibility trial designed to obtain objective auditory and linguistic data from each child's naturalistic settings (Control Condition), provide feedback to mothers about their child's home language environment (LENA Feedback Condition), and to explore effectiveness of an app designed to promote meaningful parent/child interactions during daily routines (LENA Feedback and App Condition).
    


          Results and discussion:
        
      
      The majority of mothers (80%) who participated in the trial reported a preference for using the mobile app and/or LENA technology again. Maternal responses during this pilot informed the design of an ongoing, prospective language intervention study for parents and their young children with significant hearing loss.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28756432/,2022-11-27 11:29:23 PM
Effect of Fitbit and iPad Wearable Technology in Health-Related Quality of Life in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients,"Ilana R Yurkiewicz, Pamela Simon, Michaela Liedtke, Gary Dahl, Tamara Dunn, Ilana R Yurkiewicz, Pamela Simon, Michaela Liedtke, Gary Dahl, Tamara Dunn",2018 Oct,"Purpose:
        
      
      Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer face significant challenges with regard to fatigue, reduced physical activity, and social isolation, which may negatively impact quality of life. This study investigated whether the use of digital wearable technology (Fitbits, along with synced iPads) can affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in AYA aged patients with cancer.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This was a prospective cohort study that offered Fitbits and iPads to all AYA patients aged 15 to 29 at an academic medical center at the time of cancer diagnosis. Patients completed the Short Form Health Survey developed by RAND (RAND-36) assessing eight dimensions of HRQOL on entering the study and at the time of their 6-month follow-up or the end of treatment, whichever occurred first. At the time of follow-up, patients also completed a questionnaire that assessed user experience, including frequency of wearable device use, enjoyment, challenges, and participation, in online communities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-three patients participated in the study. Most patients reported enjoying the digital technology and using the devices to track multiple aspects of their health (85%). Most also reported a subjective increase in physical activity (79%). After the intervention, participants demonstrated significant improvements across all eight dimensions of HRQOL measured by the RAND-36 (p < 0.00 to 0.01).

      Distributing wearable technology at the time of diagnosis may provide an avenue for improving HRQOL in adolescents and young adults with cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29924668/,2022-11-27 11:29:23 PM
The Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents (Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations,"Han Shi Jocelyn Chew, Han Shi Jocelyn Chew",2022 Apr 13,"Background:
        
      
      Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality-based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416791/,2022-11-27 11:29:25 PM

      To provide an overview of protocols assessing the effect of occupational exoskeletons on users and to formulate recommendations towards a literature-based assessment framework to benchmark the effect of occupational exoskeletons on the user.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science database and Scopus were searched (March 2, 2021). Studies were included if they investigated the effect of one or more occupational exoskeletons on the user.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 139 eligible studies were identified, encompassing 33, 25 and 18 unique back, shoulder and other exoskeletons, respectively. Device validation was most frequently conducted using controlled tasks while collecting muscle activity and biomechanical data. As the exoskeleton concept matures, tasks became more applied and the experimental design more representative. With that change towards realistic testing environments came a trade-off with experimental control, and user experience data became more valuable.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This evidence mapping systematic review reveals that the assessment of occupational exoskeletons is a dynamic process, and provides literature-based assessment recommendations. The homogeneity and repeatability of future exoskeleton assessment experiments will increase following these recommendations. The current review recognises the value of variability in evaluation protocols in order to obtain an overall overview of the effect of exoskeletons on the users, but the presented framework strives to facilitate benchmarking the effect of occupational exoskeletons on the users across this variety of assessment protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34600307/,2022-11-27 11:29:26 PM

Personalized Tracking of Physical Activity in Children Using a Wearable Heart Rate Monitor,"Santiago A Pérez, Ana M Díaz, Diego M López, Santiago A Pérez, Ana M Díaz, Diego M López",2020 Aug 14,"Serious games are video games that are intended to support learning while entertaining. They are considered valuable tools to improve user-specific skills or facilitate educational or therapeutic processes, especially in children. One of the disadvantages of computer games, in general, is their promotion of sedentary habits, considered as a significant risk factor for developing diseases such as obesity and hypertension. Exergames are serious games created to overcome the disadvantages of traditional computer games by promoting physical activity while playing. This study describes the development and evaluation of an adaptive component to monitor physical activity in children while using an exergame. The system is based on wearable technology to measure heart rate and perform real-time customizations in the exergame. To evaluate the adaptive component, an experiment was conducted with 30 children between 5 and 7 years of age, where the adaptive system was contrasted with a conventional interactive system (an exergame without adaptive component). It was demonstrated that the computer game, using the adaptive component, was able to change in real-time some of its functionalities based on the user characteristics. Increased levels of heart rate and caloric expenditure were significant in some of the game scenarios using the adaptive component. Although a formal user experience evaluation was not performed, excellent game playability and adherence by users were observed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32823813/,2022-11-27 11:29:27 PM
Older adults' experiences of using a wearable activity tracker with health professional feedback over a 12-month randomised controlled trial,"Katie-Jane Brickwood, Andrew D Williams, Greig Watson, Jane O'Brien, Katie-Jane Brickwood, Andrew D Williams, Greig Watson, Jane O'Brien",2020 Apr 26,"Objective:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers can help older adults remain physically active. However, knowledge of the user experience during long-term use is scarce. Therefore, this study examined older adults' experiences with, and perceptions of, wearable activity trackers combined with health professional feedback after a year's use as part of a randomised controlled trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty older adults (73.6 ± 5.5 years) who had used a Jawbone UP24 activity tracker for 12 months during a randomised controlled trial were recruited for this study. All participants had at least one chronic condition. Acceptability data relating to activity tracker wear time was combined with focus group data to explore participants experiences of long-term activity tracker use. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The activity tracker was well-accepted with the device worn on an average of 86% of possible days and participants reported an overall positive experience. Four themes were identified: (a) increased sense of awareness of activity levels is related to motivation; (b) the level of engagement with the activity tracker influences the user experience; (c) the role of feedback from a health professional in providing ongoing support; d) the role of habits in supporting long-term behaviour change.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of an activity tracker combined with health professional support can assist older adults to maintain their activity levels over 12 months. Consideration should be given to the previous technology experience of users and the design and accuracy of an activity tracker when recommending their use in a research or clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32426152/,2022-11-27 11:29:28 PM
Feasibility of smart wristbands for continuous monitoring during pregnancy and one month after birth,"Kirsi Grym, Hannakaisa Niela-Vilén, Eeva Ekholm, Lotta Hamari, Iman Azimi, Amir Rahmani, Pasi Liljeberg, Eliisa Löyttyniemi, Anna Axelin, Kirsi Grym, Hannakaisa Niela-Vilén, Eeva Ekholm, Lotta Hamari, Iman Azimi, Amir Rahmani, Pasi Liljeberg, Eliisa Löyttyniemi, Anna Axelin",2019 Jan 17,"Background:
        
      
      Smart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n = 20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30654747/,2022-11-27 11:29:30 PM

Recently, there has been progress in developing control schemes for soft exosuits that move in line with user intentions. While initial results have demonstrated sufficient device performance, the assessment of user experience via the cognitive response has yet to be evaluated. To address this, we propose a soft pneumatic elbow exosuit designed based on our previous work to provide assistance in line with user expectations utilizing two existing state-of-the-art control methods consisting of a gravity compensation and myoprocessor based on muscle activation. A user experience study was conducted to assess whether the device moves naturally with user expectations and the potential for device acceptance by determining when the exosuit violated user expectations through the neuro-cognitive and motor response. Brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) data revealed that subjects elicited error-related potentials (ErrPs) in response to unexpected exosuit actions, which were decodable across both control schemes with an average accuracy of 76.63 ± 1.73% across subjects. Additionally, unexpected exosuit actions were further decoded via the motor response from electromyography (EMG) and kinematic data with a grand average accuracy of 68.73 ± 6.83% and 77.52 ± 3.79% respectively. This work demonstrates the validation of existing state-of-the-art control schemes for soft wearable exosuits through the proposed soft pneumatic elbow exosuit. We demonstrate the feasibility of assessing device performance with respect to the cognitive response through decoding when the device violates user expectations in order to help understand and promote device acceptance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36369025/,2022-11-27 11:29:30 PM
"DigiPrEP: A Pilot Trial to Evaluate the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Accuracy of a Digital Pill System to Measure PrEP Adherence in Men Who Have Sex With Men Who Use Substances","Peter R Chai, Yassir Mohamed, Maria J Bustamante, Georgia R Goodman, Jesse Najarro, Jose Castillo-Mancilla, Alejandro Baez, Olivia Bronzi, Matthew C Sullivan, Luis M Pereira, Susan L Baumgartner, Tony C Carnes, Kenneth H Mayer, Rochelle K Rosen, Edward W Boyer, Conall O'Cleirigh, Peter R Chai, Yassir Mohamed, Maria J Bustamante, Georgia R Goodman, Jesse Najarro, Jose Castillo-Mancilla, Alejandro Baez, Olivia Bronzi, Matthew C Sullivan, Luis M Pereira, Susan L Baumgartner, Tony C Carnes, Kenneth H Mayer, Rochelle K Rosen, Edward W Boyer, Conall O'Cleirigh",2022 Feb 1,"Background:
        
      
      Adherence to once daily oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention can be challenging for men who have sex with men (MSM) with substance use. Digital pill systems (DPS) comprise a radiofrequency emitter integrated into a gelatin capsule containing PrEP, which transmits data to a wearable Reader following ingestion, thereby enabling direct, real-time adherence measurement. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy of a DPS to measure PrEP adherence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 90-day, single-arm, open-label, pilot demonstration trial was conducted with adult, cisgender, HIV-negative MSM on PrEP with nonalcohol substance use. Feasibility was measured via DPS engagement and timeline followback. Acceptability was assessed via qualitative user experience interviews. Accuracy was evaluated via DPS performance metrics, pill counts, and DBS to quantify tenofovir diphosphate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixteen MSM enrolled (median age, 32 years), and 15 completed the study. Engagement remained stable over time. Emergent nonadherence patterns included intercurrent substance use. The DPS was largely acceptable based on interviews; the predominant barrier to use was the Reader. DPS-recorded ingestions totaled 1099, including 83.9% were detected by Reader and 16.1% were reported manually. The DPS recorded 92.2% of 1192 total expected ingestions per pill counts. Point-biserial correlation (R = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.80; P = 0.047) and Pearson correlation (month 1: R = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.95; P = 0.0002; month 3: R = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.94; P = 0.0197) showed strong correlations between DPS-recorded adherence and tenofovir diphosphate in dried blood spots.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      DPS are a feasible, acceptable, and accurate method of measuring PrEP adherence in MSM with substance use. Future investigations should incorporate DPS into behavioral interventions targeting nonadherence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34753871/,2022-11-27 11:29:31 PM
Older Adults' Experiences With Using Wearable Devices: Qualitative Systematic Review and Meta-synthesis,"Kevin Moore, Emma O'Shea, Lorna Kenny, John Barton, Salvatore Tedesco, Marco Sica, Colum Crowe, Antti Alamäki, Joan Condell, Anna Nordström, Suzanne Timmons, Kevin Moore, Emma O'Shea, Lorna Kenny, John Barton, Salvatore Tedesco, Marco Sica, Colum Crowe, Antti Alamäki, Joan Condell, Anna Nordström, Suzanne Timmons",2021 Jun 3,"Background:
        
      
      Older adults may use wearable devices for various reasons, ranging from monitoring clinically relevant health metrics or detecting falls to monitoring physical activity. Little is known about how this population engages with wearable devices, and no qualitative synthesis exists to describe their shared experiences with long-term use.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to synthesize qualitative studies of user experience after a multi-day trial with a wearable device to understand user experience and the factors that contribute to the acceptance and use of wearable devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic search in CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase (2015-2020; English) with fixed search terms relating to older adults and wearable devices. A meta-synthesis methodology was used. We extracted themes from primary studies, identified key concepts, and applied reciprocal and refutational translation techniques; findings were synthesized into third-order interpretations, and finally, a ""line-of-argument"" was developed. Our overall goal was theory development, higher-level abstraction, and generalizability for making this group of qualitative findings more accessible.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, we reviewed 20 papers; 2 evaluated fall detection devices, 1 tested an ankle-worn step counter, and the remaining 17 tested activity trackers. The duration of wearing ranged from 3 days to 24 months. The views of 349 participants (age: range 51-94 years) were synthesized. Four key concepts were identified and outlined: motivation for device use, user characteristics (openness to engage and functional ability), integration into daily life, and device features. Motivation for device use is intrinsic and extrinsic, encompassing many aspects of the user experience, and appears to be as, if not more, important than the actual device features. To overcome usability barriers, an older adult must be motivated by the useful purpose of the device. A device that serves its intended purpose adds value to the user's life. The user's needs and the support structure around the device-aspects that are often overlooked-seem to play a crucial role in long-term adoption. Our ""line-of-argument"" model describes how motivation, ease of use, and device purpose determine whether a device is perceived to add value to the user's life, which subsequently predicts whether the device will be integrated into the user's life.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The added value of a wearable device is the resulting balance of motivators (or lack thereof), device features (and their accuracy), ease of use, device purpose, and user experience. The added value contributes to the successful integration of the device into the daily life of the user. Useful device features alone do not lead to continued use. A support structure should be placed around the user to foster motivation, encourage peer engagement, and adapt to the user's preferences.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34081020/,2022-11-27 11:29:32 PM
"Design of a Low-Cost, Wearable Device for Kinematic Analysis in Physical Therapy Settings","Andrew Hua, Nicole Johnson, Joshua Quinton, Pratik Chaudhary, David Buchner, Manuel E Hernandez, Andrew Hua, Nicole Johnson, Joshua Quinton, Pratik Chaudhary, David Buchner, Manuel E Hernandez",2020 Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Unsupervised home exercise is a major component of physical therapy (PT). This study proposes an inexpensive, inertial measurement unit-based wearable device to capture kinematic data to facilitate exercise. However, conveying and interpreting kinematic data to non-experts poses a challenge due to the complexity and background knowledge required that most patients lack.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objectives of this study were to identify key user interface and user experience features that would likely improve device adoption and assess participant receptiveness toward the device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty participants were recruited to perform nine upper extremity exercises while wearing the device. Prior to exercise, participants completed an orientation of the device, which included examples of software graphics with exercise data. Surveys that measured receptiveness toward the device, software graphics, and ergonomics were given before and after exercise.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants were highly receptive to the device with 90% of the participants likely to use the device during PT. Participants understood how the simple kinematic data could be used to aid exercise, but the data could be difficult to comprehend with more complex movements. Devices should incorporate wireless sensors and emphasize ease of wear.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Device-guided home physical rehabilitation can allow for individualized treatment protocols and improve exercise self-efficacy through kinematic analysis. Future studies should implement clinical testing to evaluate the impact a wearable device can have on rehabilitation outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32535880/,2022-11-27 11:29:33 PM
Quantifying physical activity in early Parkinson disease using a commercial activity monitor,"Sujata Pradhan, Valerie E Kelly, Sujata Pradhan, Valerie E Kelly",2019 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      Physical inactivity in Parkinson disease (PD) has an impact on motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease. It is unclear whether this decline in physical activity occurs early in the disease, in addition to any decline due to aging, and whether commercial activity monitors can be used to self-monitor physical activity levels in this population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the quantity and intensity of physical activity (PA), as measured by commercial activity monitors, in people with mild PD and healthy older adults (HOA). A secondary objective was to assess adherence and user experience with wearing the activity monitoring device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An observational descriptive study design examined PA levels over a 14-day period using commercially-available activity monitors (Fitbit Charge HR).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Individuals with PD (n = 30) and HOA (n = 30) both demonstrated high adherence with wear time (PD = 13.8 [0.5] days, HOA = 13.9 [0.4] days, p = 0.55). People with PD took fewer steps per day than HOA (PD = 6416.9 (2795.5), HOA = 11441.3 (3932.1), p < 0.001). Compared to HOA, individuals with PD spent fewer minutes per day engaged in moderate to vigorous intensity activity (PD = 33.0 (22.5), HOA = 72.0(37.3), p < 0.001) and more minutes per day sedentary (PD = 803.74 (154.9), HOA = 578.26 (103.7), p < 0.001). Both groups reported that ease of use and satisfaction with the activity monitor were high.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      People with mild PD demonstrated reduced quantity and intensity of PA compared to HOA. Both the PD and the HOA groups had good adherence wearing a commercial activity monitor that provided feedback regarding activity levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31420310/,2022-11-27 11:29:34 PM
"""Listen to Your Immune System When It's Calling for You"": Monitoring Autoimmune Diseases Using the iShU App","Cláudia Ortet, Liliana Vale Costa, Cláudia Ortet, Liliana Vale Costa",2022 May 18,"The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35632243/,2022-11-27 11:29:35 PM

A Longitudinal Explorative Field Study Among Geographically Separated Romantic Couples","Martijn T van Hattum, Gijs Huisman, Alexander Toet, Jan B F van Erp, Martijn T van Hattum, Gijs Huisman, Alexander Toet, Jan B F van Erp",2022 Feb 17,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in research on mediated communication via social touch. Previous studies indicated that mediated social touch (MST) can induce similar positive outcomes to interpersonal touch. However, studies investigating the user experience of MST technology predominantly involve brief experiments that are performed in well-controlled laboratory conditions. Hence, it is still unknown how MST affects the relationship and communication between physically separated partners in a romantic relationship, in a naturalistic setting and over a longer period of time. In a longitudinal explorative field study, the effects of MST on social connectedness and longing for touch among geographically separated romantic couples were investigated in a naturalistic setting. For 2 weeks, 17 couples used haptic bracelets, that were connected via the internet, to exchange mediated squeeze-like touch signals. Before and after this period, they reported their feelings of social connectedness and longing for touch through questionnaires. The results show that the use of haptic bracelets (1) enhanced social connectedness among geographically separated couples but (2) did not affect their longing for touch. Interviews conducted at the end of the study were analyzed following the thematic analysis method to generate prominent themes and patterns in using MST technology among participant couples. Two main themes were generated that captured (a) the way the bracelets fostered a positive one-to-one connection between partners and (b) the way in which participants worked around their frustrations with the bracelets. Detailed findings and limitations of this longitudinal field study are further discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35250751/,2022-11-27 11:29:35 PM

The first phase was developed in Europeans Space Agency's (ESA) project called ""EdcAR-Augmented Reality for Assembly, Integration, Testing and Verification, and Operations"" and the second phase was developed and evaluated within the Horizon 2020 project ""WEKIT-Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training."" The main aim is to create an AR based technological platform for high knowledge manual work support, in the aerospace industry with reasonable user experience. The AR system was designed for the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform, and it was implemented based on a modular architecture. The purpose of the evaluation of the AR system is to prove that reasonable user experience of augmented reality can reduce performance errors while executing a procedure, increase memorability, and improve cost, and time efficiency of the training. The main purpose of the first phase evaluation was to observe and get feedback from the AR system, from user experience point-of-view for the future development. The use case was a filter change in International Space Station (ISS)-Columbus mock-up in the ESA's European Astronaut Centre (EAC). The test group of 14 subjects it included an experienced astronaut, EAC trainers, other EAC personnel, and a student group. The second phase the experiment consisted of an in-situ trial and evaluation process. The augmented reality system was tested at ALTEC facilities in Turin, Italy, where 39 participants were performing an actual real astronaut's procedure, the installation of Temporary Stowage Rack (TSR) on a physical mock-up of an ISS module. User experience evaluation was assessed using comprehensive questionnaires, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their experience with a platform. This focused on technology acceptance, system usability, smart glasses user satisfaction, user interaction satisfaction, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their experience with a platform. The analysis of the questionnaires and interviews showed that the scores obtained for user experience, usability, user satisfaction, and technology acceptance were near the desired average.

An intervention study to assess potential effect and user experience of an mHealth intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour among older office workers,"Simone Boerema, Lex van Velsen, Hermie Hermens, Simone Boerema, Lex van Velsen, Hermie Hermens",2019 Nov,"Background:
        
      
      Office workers spend a high percentage of their time sitting, often in long periods of time. Research suggests that it is healthier to break these long bouts into shorter periods by being physically active.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We evaluated the effect of a context-aware activity coach, called the PEARL app, an mHealth intervention that provides activity suggestions, based on a physical activity prediction model, consisting of past and current physical activity and digital agendas.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Fifteen office workers, aged 50+, participated in an intervention study in which they used the intervention for 1 week, preceded by a 1-week baseline period. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      107 days of data from 14 participants were analysed. Total sedentary time was not reduced as a result of using the intervention (baseline vs intervention: 47.8±3.6 vs 46.8±3.0, n.s.). When using the intervention, participants reduced their total time spent in long sitting bouts (≥45 min) from 19.3 to 14.4 min per hour of wear time (p<0.05). Participants indicated that the main value of the intervention lies in creating awareness about their personal sedentary behaviour pattern.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An mHealth service has the potential to improve the sedentary behaviour of older office workers, especially for breaking up long sedentary periods. Focusing on total sedentary time as an outcome of an intervention, aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour, is too simplistic. One should take into account both the duration and the number of bouts when determining the effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31744844/,2022-11-27 11:29:38 PM
"Factors Influencing Motivation and Engagement in Mobile Health Among Patients With Sickle Cell Disease in Low-Prevalence, High-Income Countries: Qualitative Exploration of Patient Requirements","David-Zacharie Issom, André Henriksen, Ashenafi Zebene Woldaregay, Jessica Rochat, Christian Lovis, Gunnar Hartvigsen, David-Zacharie Issom, André Henriksen, Ashenafi Zebene Woldaregay, Jessica Rochat, Christian Lovis, Gunnar Hartvigsen",2020 Mar 24,"Background:
        
      
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological genetic disease affecting over 25 million people worldwide. The main clinical manifestations of SCD, hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion, lead to chronic pain and organ damages. With recent advances in childhood care, high-income countries have seen SCD drift from a disease of early childhood mortality to a neglected chronic disease of adulthood. In particular, coordinated, preventive, and comprehensive care for adults with SCD is largely underresourced. Consequently, patients are left to self-manage. Mobile health (mHealth) apps for chronic disease self-management are now flooding app stores. However, evidence remains unclear about their effectiveness, and the literature indicates low user engagement and poor adoption rates. Finally, few apps have been developed for people with SCD and none encompasses their numerous and complex self-care management needs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to identify factors that may influence the long-term engagement and user adoption of mHealth among the particularly isolated community of adult patients with SCD living in low-prevalence, high-income countries.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Semistructured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Analysis was informed by the Braun and Clarke framework and mapped to the COM-B model (capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior). Results were classified into high-level functional requirements (FRs) and nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) to guide the development of future mHealth interventions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 6 males and 4 females were interviewed (aged between 21 and 55 years). Thirty FRs and 31 NFRs were extracted from the analysis. Most participants (8/10) were concerned about increasing their physical capabilities being able to stop pain symptoms quickly. Regarding the psychological capability aspects, all interviewees desired to receive trustworthy feedback on their self-care management practices. About their physical opportunities, most (7/10) expressed a strong desire to receive alerts when they would reach their own physiological limitations (ie, during physical activity). Concerning social opportunity, most (9/10) reported wanting to learn about the self-care practices of other patients. Relating to motivational aspects, many interviewees (6/10) stressed their need to learn how to avoid the symptoms and live as normal a life as possible. Finally, NFRs included inconspicuousness and customizability of user experience, automatic data collection, data shareability, and data privacy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that motivation and engagement with mHealth technologies among the studied population could be increased by providing features that clearly benefit them. Self-management support and self-care decision aid are patients' major demands. As the complexity of SCD self-management requires a high cognitive load, pervasive health technologies such as wearable sensors, implantable devices, or inconspicuous conversational user interfaces should be explored to ease it. Some of the required technologies already exist but must be integrated, bundled, adapted, or improved to meet the specific needs of people with SCD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32207692/,2022-11-27 11:29:39 PM
Physical activity evaluation in children with congenital heart disease,"Christine Voss, Kevin C Harris, Christine Voss, Kevin C Harris",2017 Sep,"Significant advances in the management of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have resulted in marked improvements in survival and life expectancy. Thus, there is an increased emphasis on promoting physical activity to optimise healthy development and long-term cardiovascular health. Evaluation of physical activity levels as part of ongoing clinical care is recommended to facilitate physical activity counselling and/or exercise prescription. Physical activity is a complex health behaviour that is challenging to evaluate. We provide an overview of techniques for measuring physical activity in children with CHD with a focus on how to do this in the clinical context. Accelerometers are devices that objectively assess intensity and duration of physical activity under free living conditions. They enable evaluation against physical activity guidelines, but are costly and require advanced technical expertise. Pedometers are a simple-to-use and cost-effective alternative, but an outcome metric of daily step count limits classification against guidelines. Commercial wearable activity trackers offer an appealing user experience and can provide valid estimates in children. Furthermore, activity trackers enable remote monitoring of physical activity levels, which may facilitate exercise prescription and activity counselling. Questionnaires are the most cost-effective and time-effective method, but recall error in younger children is a consideration. Routine exercise testing in children with CHD provides important insight into functional status but should not be viewed as a proxy measure of habitual physical activity. Understanding the spectrum and role of physical activity measurement tools is important for clinicians focused on optimising cardiovascular health in children with CHD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490620/,2022-11-27 11:29:40 PM
Improving the user experience of televisits and telemonitoring for heart failure patients in less than 6 months: a methodological approach,"Anna Savoldelli, Andrea Vitali, Andrea Remuzzi, Vittorio Giudici, Anna Savoldelli, Andrea Vitali, Andrea Remuzzi, Vittorio Giudici",2022 May,"Background:
        
      
      With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients.

      Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the designed method with other categories of chronic patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35259670/,2022-11-27 11:29:40 PM
A Wearable Sensor System for Physical Ergonomics Interventions Using Haptic Feedback,"Carl Mikael Lind, Jose Antonio Diaz-Olivares, Kaj Lindecrantz, Jörgen Eklund, Carl Mikael Lind, Jose Antonio Diaz-Olivares, Kaj Lindecrantz, Jörgen Eklund",2020 Oct 23,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major concern globally affecting societies, companies, and individuals. To address this, a new sensor-based system is presented: the Smart Workwear System, aimed at facilitating preventive measures by supporting risk assessments, work design, and work technique training. The system has a module-based platform that enables flexibility of sensor-type utilization, depending on the specific application. A module of the Smart Workwear System that utilizes haptic feedback for work technique training is further presented and evaluated in simulated mail sorting on sixteen novice participants for its potential to reduce adverse arm movements and postures in repetitive manual handling. Upper-arm postures were recorded, using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), perceived pain/discomfort with the Borg CR10-scale, and user experience with a semi-structured interview. This study shows that the use of haptic feedback for work technique training has the potential to significantly reduce the time in adverse upper-arm postures after short periods of training. The haptic feedback was experienced positive and usable by the participants and was effective in supporting learning of how to improve postures and movements. It is concluded that this type of sensorized system, using haptic feedback training, is promising for the future, especially when organizations are introducing newly employed staff, when teaching ergonomics to employees in physically demanding jobs, and when performing ergonomics interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113922/,2022-11-27 11:29:41 PM
Continuous 24-h Photoplethysmogram Monitoring Enables Detection of Atrial Fibrillation,"Eemu-Samuli Väliaho, Jukka A Lipponen, Pekka Kuoppa, Tero J Martikainen, Helena Jäntti, Tuomas T Rissanen, Maaret Castrén, Jari Halonen, Mika P Tarvainen, Tiina M Laitinen, Tomi P Laitinen, Onni E Santala, Olli Rantula, Noora S Naukkarinen, Juha E K Hartikainen, Eemu-Samuli Väliaho, Jukka A Lipponen, Pekka Kuoppa, Tero J Martikainen, Helena Jäntti, Tuomas T Rissanen, Maaret Castrén, Jari Halonen, Mika P Tarvainen, Tiina M Laitinen, Tomi P Laitinen, Onni E Santala, Olli Rantula, Noora S Naukkarinen, Juha E K Hartikainen",2022 Jan 4,"Aim: Atrial fibrillation (AF) detection is challenging because it is often asymptomatic and paroxysmal. We evaluated continuous photoplethysmogram (PPG) for signal quality and detection of AF. Methods: PPGs were recorded using a wrist-band device in 173 patients (76 AF, 97 sinus rhythm, SR) for 24 h. Simultaneously recorded 3-lead ambulatory ECG served as control. The recordings were split into 10-, 20-, 30-, and 60-min time-frames. The sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of AF detection were evaluated for each time-frame. AF alarms were generated to simulate continuous AF monitoring. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values (PPVs) of the alarms were evaluated. User experiences of PPG and ECG recordings were assessed. The study was registered in the Clinical Trials database (NCT03507335). Results: The quality of PPG signal was better during night-time than in daytime (67.3 ± 22.4% vs. 30.5 ± 19.4%, p < 0.001). The 30-min time-frame yielded the highest F1-score (0.9536), identifying AF correctly in 72/76 AF patients (sensitivity 94.7%), only 3/97 SR patients receiving a false AF diagnosis (specificity 96.9%). The sensitivity and PPV of the simulated AF alarms were 78.2 and 97.2% at night, and 49.3 and 97.0% during the daytime. 82% of patients were willing to use the device at home. Conclusion: PPG wrist-band provided reliable AF identification both during daytime and night-time. The PPG data's quality was better at night. The positive user experience suggests that wearable PPG devices could be feasible for continuous rhythm monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35058796/,2022-11-27 11:29:42 PM
Accuracy of remote chest X-ray interpretation using Google Glass technology,"Emily Spaedy, Georgios E Christakopoulos, Muhammad Nauman J Tarar, Georgios Christopoulos, Bavana V Rangan, Michele Roesle, Cristhiaan D Ochoa, William Yarbrough, Subhash Banerjee, Emmanouil S Brilakis, Emily Spaedy, Georgios E Christakopoulos, Muhammad Nauman J Tarar, Georgios Christopoulos, Bavana V Rangan, Michele Roesle, Cristhiaan D Ochoa, William Yarbrough, Subhash Banerjee, Emmanouil S Brilakis",2016 Sep 15,"Objectives:
        
      
      We sought to explore the accuracy of remote chest X-ray reading using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass, Google, Mountain View, California).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We compared interpretation of twelve chest X-rays with 23 major cardiopulmonary findings by faculty and fellows from cardiology, radiology, and pulmonary-critical care via: (1) viewing the chest X-ray image on the Google Glass screen; (2) viewing a photograph of the chest X-ray taken using Google Glass and interpreted on a mobile device; (3) viewing the original chest X-ray on a desktop computer screen. One point was given for identification of each correct finding and a subjective rating of user experience was recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen physicians (5 faculty and 10 fellows) participated. The average chest X-ray reading score (maximum 23 points) as viewed through the Google Glass, Google Glass photograph on a mobile device, and the original X-ray viewed on a desktop computer was 14.1±2.2, 18.5±1.5 and 21.3±1.7, respectively (p<0.0001 between Google Glass and mobile device, p<0.0001 between Google Glass and desktop computer and p=0.0004 between mobile device and desktop computer). Of 15 physicians, 11 (73.3%) felt confident in detecting findings using the photograph taken by Google Glass as viewed on a mobile device.
    


          Conclusion:

Feasibility of a Sensor-Based Technological Platform in Assessing Gait and Sleep of In-Hospital Stroke and Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (iSCI) Patients,"Maartje M S Hendriks, Marije Vos-van der Hulst, Noel L W Keijsers, Maartje M S Hendriks, Marije Vos-van der Hulst, Noel L W Keijsers",2020 May 12,"Recovery of the walking function is one of the most common rehabilitation goals of neurological patients. Sufficient and adequate sleep is a prerequisite for recovery or training. To objectively monitor patients' progress, a combination of different sensors measuring continuously over time is needed. A sensor-based technological platform offers possibilities to monitor gait and sleep. Implementation in clinical practice is of utmost relevance and has scarcely been studied. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of a sensor-based technological platform within the clinical setting. Participants (12 incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), 13 stroke) were asked to wear inertial measurement units (IMUs) around the ankles during daytime and the bed sensor was placed under their mattress for one week. Feasibility was established based on missing data, error cause, and user experience. Percentage of missing measurement days and nights was 14% and 4%, respectively. Main cause of lost measurement days was related to missing IMU sensor data. Participants were not impeded, did not experience any discomfort, and found the sensors easy to use. The sensor-based technological platform is feasible to use within the clinical rehabilitation setting for continuously monitoring gait and sleep of iSCI and stroke patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32408490/,2022-11-27 11:29:43 PM
Electrodeless Heart and Respiratory Rate Estimation during Sleep Using a Single Fabric Band and Event-Based Edge Processing,"Titus Jayarathna, Gaetano D Gargiulo, Gough Y Lui, Paul P Breen, Titus Jayarathna, Gaetano D Gargiulo, Gough Y Lui, Paul P Breen",2022 Sep 4,"Heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) are two vital parameters of the body medically used for diagnosing short/long-term illness. Out-of-the-body, non-skin-contact HR/RR measurement remains a challenge due to imprecise readings. ""Invisible"" wearables integrated into day-to-day garments have the potential to produce precise readings with a comfortable user experience. Sleep studies and patient monitoring benefit from ""Invisibles"" due to longer wearability without significant discomfort. This paper suggests a novel method to reduce the footprint of sleep monitoring devices. We use a single silver-coated nylon fabric band integrated into a substrate of a standard cotton/nylon garment as a resistive elastomer sensor to measure air and blood volume change across the chest. We introduce a novel event-based architecture to process data at the edge device and describe two algorithms to calculate real-time HR/RR on ARM Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4F microcontrollers. RR estimations show a sensitivity of 99.03% and a precision of 99.03% for identifying individual respiratory peaks. The two algorithms used for HR calculation show a mean absolute error of 0.81 ± 0.97 and 0.86±0.61 beats/min compared with a gold standard ECG-based HR. The event-based algorithm converts the respiratory/pulse waveform into instantaneous events, therefore reducing the data size by 40-140 times and requiring 33% less power to process and transfer data. Furthermore, we show that events hold enough information to reconstruct the original waveform, retaining pulse and respiratory activity. We suggest fabric sensors and event-based algorithms would drastically reduce the device footprint and increase the performance for HR/RR estimations during sleep studies, providing a better user experience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36081149/,2022-11-27 11:29:44 PM
Objective Monitoring of Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy During Clinical Trials Using a Smartphone App and Wearables: Observational Study,"Ghobad Maleki, Ahnjili Zhuparris, Ingrid Koopmans, Robert J Doll, Nicoline Voet, Adam Cohen, Emilie van Brummelen, Geert Jan Groeneveld, Joris De Maeyer, Ghobad Maleki, Ahnjili Zhuparris, Ingrid Koopmans, Robert J Doll, Nicoline Voet, Adam Cohen, Emilie van Brummelen, Geert Jan Groeneveld, Joris De Maeyer",2022 Sep 13,"Background:
        
      
      Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscle dystrophy disorder leading to significant disability. Currently, FSHD symptom severity is assessed by clinical assessments such as the FSHD clinical score and the Timed Up-and-Go test. These assessments are limited in their ability to capture changes continuously and the full impact of the disease on patients' quality of life. Real-world data related to physical activity, sleep, and social behavior could potentially provide additional insight into the impact of the disease and might be useful in assessing treatment effects on aspects that are important contributors to the functioning and well-being of patients with FSHD.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study investigated the feasibility of using smartphones and wearables to capture symptoms related to FSHD based on a continuous collection of multiple features, such as the number of steps, sleep, and app use. We also identified features that can be used to differentiate between patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this exploratory noninterventional study, 58 participants (n=38, 66%, patients with FSHD and n=20, 34%, non-FSHD controls) were monitored using a smartphone monitoring app for 6 weeks. On the first and last day of the study period, clinicians assessed the participants' FSHD clinical score and Timed Up-and-Go test time. Participants installed the app on their Android smartphones, were given a smartwatch, and were instructed to measure their weight and blood pressure on a weekly basis using a scale and blood pressure monitor. The user experience and perceived burden of the app on participants' smartphones were assessed at 6 weeks using a questionnaire. With the data collected, we sought to identify the behavioral features that were most salient in distinguishing the 2 groups (patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls) and the optimal time window to perform the classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, the participants stated that the app was well tolerated, but 67% (39/58) noticed a difference in battery life using all 6 weeks of data, we classified patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls with 93% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. We found that the optimal time window for the classification is the first day of data collection and the first week of data collection, which yielded an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.8%, 100%, and 94.4%, respectively. Features relating to smartphone acceleration, app use, location, physical activity, sleep, and call behavior were the most salient features for the classification.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remotely monitored data collection allowed for the collection of daily activity data in patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls for 6 weeks. We demonstrated the initial ability to detect differences in features in patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls using smartphones and wearables, mainly based on data related to physical and social activity.

User experience and clinical effectiveness with two wearable global positioning system devices in home dementia care,"Herlind Megges, Silka Dawn Freiesleben, Christina Rösch, Nina Knoll, Lauri Wessel, Oliver Peters, Herlind Megges, Silka Dawn Freiesleben, Christina Rösch, Nina Knoll, Lauri Wessel, Oliver Peters",2018 Nov 9,"Introduction:
        
      
      The user experience and clinical effectiveness with wearable global positioning system (GPS) devices for persons with dementia (PwDs) and caregivers (CGs) remain unclear although many are available.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using a crossover design, 20 dyads tested two similar commercial GPS watches (products A and B) at home for 4 weeks each. Usability, product functions, design features and product satisfaction at home and the clinic were investigated. Caregiver burden and quality of life assessed clinical effectiveness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The final 17 dyads rated the usability, telephone function, overall design features, font, buttons, and battery life of B significantly better than A. PwDs rated the overall design features and buttons of A significantly better than CGs. Product satisfaction with both products was significantly lower at home. Clinical effectiveness was not found.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      User experience can be improved by optimizing specific product details. This might translate to clinical effectiveness.

Development of a Wearable Cardiac Monitoring System for Behavioral Neurocardiac Training: A Usability Study,"Akib A Uddin, Plinio P Morita, Kevin Tallevi, Kevin Armour, John Li, Robert P Nolan, Joseph A Cafazzo, Akib A Uddin, Plinio P Morita, Kevin Tallevi, Kevin Armour, John Li, Robert P Nolan, Joseph A Cafazzo",2016 Apr 22,"Background:
        
      
      Elevated blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for death globally. Behavioral neurocardiac training (BNT) is a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management that is intended to exercise the autonomic reflexes, improve stress recovery, and lower blood pressure. BNT involves cognitive-behavioral therapy with a paced breathing technique and heart rate variability biofeedback. BNT is limited to in-clinic delivery and faces an accessibility barrier because of the need for clinical oversight and the use of complex monitoring tools.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this project was to design, develop, and evaluate a wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensor system for the delivery of BNT in a home setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The wearable sensor system, Beat, consists of an ECG sensor and a mobile app. It was developed iteratively using the principles of test-driven Agile development and user-centered design. A usability study was conducted at Toronto General Hospital to evaluate feasibility and user experience and identify areas of improvement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Beat sensor was designed as a modular patch to be worn on the user's chest and uses standard ECG electrodes. It streams a single-lead ECG wirelessly to a mobile phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. The use of small, low-power electronics, a low device profile, and a tapered enclosure allowed for a device that can be unobtrusively worn under clothing. The sensor was designed to operate with a mobile app that guides users through the BNT exercises to train them to a slow-paced breathing technique for stress recovery. The BNT app uses the ECG captured by the sensor to provide heart rate variability biofeedback in the form of a real-time heart rate waveform to complement and reinforce the impact of the training. Usability testing (n=6) indicated that the overall response to the design and user experience of the system was perceived positively. All participants indicated that the system had a positive effect on stress management and that they would use it at home. Areas of improvement were identified, which focused primarily on the delivery of training and education on BNT through the app.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The outcome of this project was a wearable sensor system to deliver BNT at home. The system has the potential to offer a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management at home and reduce current accessibility barriers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27106171/,2022-11-27 11:29:47 PM
A Brief Training Program to Support the Use of a Digital Pill System for Medication Adherence: Pilot Descriptive Study,"Peter R Chai, Maria J Bustamante, Georgia Goodman, Yassir Mohamed, Jesse Najarro, Matthew C Sullivan, Jose Castillo-Mancilla, Ryan P Coyle, Kenneth H Mayer, Rochelle K Rosen, Susan L Baumgartner, Pamela E Alpert, Edward W Boyer, Conall O'Cleirigh, Peter R Chai, Maria J Bustamante, Georgia Goodman, Yassir Mohamed, Jesse Najarro, Matthew C Sullivan, Jose Castillo-Mancilla, Ryan P Coyle, Kenneth H Mayer, Rochelle K Rosen, Susan L Baumgartner, Pamela E Alpert, Edward W Boyer, Conall O'Cleirigh",2021 Apr 23,"Background:
        
      
      Digital pill systems (DPSs), which comprise ingestible radiofrequency sensors integrated into a gelatin capsule that overencapsulates a medication, can directly measure ingestion events.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Teaching users to operate a DPS is vital to ensure the collection of actionable ingestion and adherence data. In this study, we aim to develop and pilot a training program, grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, to instruct individuals on DPS operation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A two-part training program, comprising in-person and text message-based components, was used with HIV-negative men who have sex with men with nonalcohol substance use, who had enrolled in a 90-day pilot demonstration study using the DPS to measure adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis. We assessed the number of responses to text check-ins, the number and types of episodes where technical support was requested, the resolutions of such issues, and engagement with the program over the study period. Participant feedback on the program was evaluated through qualitative user experience interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 15 participants were enrolled in and completed the program. Seven technical challenges related to DPS operations were reported across 5 participants. Most commonly, participants requested support connecting the wearable Reader device with their smartphone, charging the Reader, and operating the mobile app. A total of 6 issues were resolved asynchronously or in real time via phone; 1 required in-person evaluation and resolution. Preliminary qualitative findings indicate that both the in-person and remote follow-up components of the training program were perceived as acceptable. Suggested improvements included repeated DPS refresher sessions at in-person follow-up visits and enhanced written materials for the independent resolution of technological issues.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A brief two-part DPS training program, drawing from individuals' experiences and from the Technology Acceptance Model, can provide valuable insights for users. The program also identifies and addresses several areas of actual or potential challenges related to operating a DPS and allows for the resolution of such issues within the first week of DPS use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33890863/,2022-11-27 11:29:48 PM
Safety and usability of wearable accelerometers for stroke detection the STROKE ALARM PRO 1 study,"Magnus Esbjörnsson, Teresa Ullberg, Magnus Esbjörnsson, Teresa Ullberg",2022 Nov,"Objectives:
        
      
      The introduction of time-dependent reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke has increased the need for early identification. We explore the safety and feasibility of STROKE ALARM which detects sudden arm paresis, the most frequent symptom in stroke.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Consecutive patients admitted with a stroke or TIA at Skåne University Hospital were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and included in the STROKE ALARM PRO 1 Study aiming to explore the feasibility of prolonged use (30 days) of the system in the community. STROKE ALARM consists of paired arm bracelets with accelerometers, coupled with a stroke test in a smartphone application. In case of an imbalance in arm movements, the user is prompted to perform an app-based stroke test. Failure to respond or to complete the stroke test correctly, triggers notification by SMS to predefined emergency contacts. Patients were followed up by telephone after completion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty patients were included and 28 completed follow-up. Median age was 68 years and 36.7% were female. No stroke events were recorded during follow-up. False indications occurred in all but one patient, and 22 (78.6%) experienced alarms to their emergency contacts. Despite a high level of false alarms, general user experience was rated in a positive or neutral manner by almost 90%. Very frequent alarms were probably due to mild arm paresis not detected in routine clinical assessment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Use of STROKE ALARM for 30 days after stroke/TIA was well tolerated warranting further study for early automated detection of stroke recurrence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36115106/,2022-11-27 11:29:48 PM
"Development of a metric to evaluate the ergonomic principles of assistive systems, based on the DIN 92419","Flávia Xavier Macedo de Azevedo, Rüdiger Heimgärtner, Karsten Nebe, Flávia Xavier Macedo de Azevedo, Rüdiger Heimgärtner, Karsten Nebe",2022 Sep 30,"The DIN 92419 defines six principles for assistive systems' ergonomic design. There is, however, a lack of measurement tools to evaluate assistive systems considering these principles. Consequently, this study developed a measurement tool for the quantitative evaluation of the fulfilment of each principle for assistive systems. A systematic literature review was performed to identify dimensions belonging to the principles, identify how previous research evaluated these dimensions, and develop a measurement tool for assistive systems. Findings show that scales commonly used for evaluating assistive systems disregard several aspects highlighted as relevant by research, implying the need for considering the DIN 92419 principles. Based on established scales and theoretical findings, a questionnaire, and a checklist for evaluating assistive systems were developed. The work provides a grounding for measuring relevant aspects of assistive systems. Further development is needed to substantiate the reliability and validity of the proposed questionnaire scales and items. Practitioner Summary: Responding to the gap of a holistic measurement tool to evaluate assistive systems, a systematic literature review was performed considering the DIN 92419 principles.

      Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering).

      Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35225818/,2022-11-27 11:29:50 PM
Using Fitness Trackers and Smartwatches to Measure Physical Activity in Research: Analysis of Consumer Wrist-Worn Wearables,"André Henriksen, Martin Haugen Mikalsen, Ashenafi Zebene Woldaregay, Miroslav Muzny, Gunnar Hartvigsen, Laila Arnesdatter Hopstock, Sameline Grimsgaard, André Henriksen, Martin Haugen Mikalsen, Ashenafi Zebene Woldaregay, Miroslav Muzny, Gunnar Hartvigsen, Laila Arnesdatter Hopstock, Sameline Grimsgaard",2018 Mar 22,"Background:
        
      
      New fitness trackers and smartwatches are released to the consumer market every year. These devices are equipped with different sensors, algorithms, and accompanying mobile apps. With recent advances in mobile sensor technology, privately collected physical activity data can be used as an addition to existing methods for health data collection in research. Furthermore, data collected from these devices have possible applications in patient diagnostics and treatment. With an increasing number of diverse brands, there is a need for an overview of device sensor support, as well as device applicability in research projects.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to examine the availability of wrist-worn fitness wearables and analyze availability of relevant fitness sensors from 2011 to 2017. Furthermore, the study was designed to assess brand usage in research projects, compare common brands in terms of developer access to collected health data, and features to consider when deciding which brand to use in future research.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched for devices and brand names in six wearable device databases. For each brand, we identified additional devices on official brand websites. The search was limited to wrist-worn fitness wearables with accelerometers, for which we mapped brand, release year, and supported sensors relevant for fitness tracking. In addition, we conducted a Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and ClinicalTrials search to determine brand usage in research projects. Finally, we investigated developer accessibility to the health data collected by identified brands.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 423 unique devices from 132 different brands. Forty-seven percent of brands released only one device. Introduction of new brands peaked in 2014, and the highest number of new devices was introduced in 2015. Sensor support increased every year, and in addition to the accelerometer, a photoplethysmograph, for estimating heart rate, was the most common sensor. Out of the brands currently available, the five most often used in research projects are Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit, Apple, and Polar. Fitbit is used in twice as many validation studies as any other brands and is registered in ClinicalTrials studies 10 times as often as other brands.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The wearable landscape is in constant change. New devices and brands are released every year, promising improved measurements and user experience. At the same time, other brands disappear from the consumer market for various reasons. Advances in device quality offer new opportunities for research. However, only a few well-established brands are frequently used in research projects, and even less are thoroughly validated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29567635/,2022-11-27 11:29:51 PM
Health Promotion for Childhood Obesity: An Approach Based on Self-Tracking of Data,"Nazaret Gómez-Del-Río, Carina S González-González, Pedro A Toledo-Delgado, Vanesa Muñoz-Cruz, Francisco García-Peñalvo, Nazaret Gómez-Del-Río, Carina S González-González, Pedro A Toledo-Delgado, Vanesa Muñoz-Cruz, Francisco García-Peñalvo",2020 Jul 6,"At present, obesity and overweight are a global health epidemic. Traditional interventions for promoting healthy habits do not appear to be effective. However, emerging technological solutions based on wearables and mobile devices can be useful in promoting healthy habits. These applications generate a considerable amount of tracked activity data. Consequently, our approach is based on the quantified-self model for recommending healthy activities. Gamification can also be used as a mechanism to enhance personalization, increasing user motivation. This paper describes the quantified-self model and its data sources, the activity recommender system, and the PROVITAO App user experience model. Furthermore, it presents the results of a gamified program applied for three years in children with obesity and the process of evaluating the quantified-self model with experts. Positive outcomes were obtained in children's medical parameters and health habits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640540/,2022-11-27 11:29:52 PM
Patients self-mastery of wearable devices for seizure detection: A direct user-experience,"E Bruno, A Biondi, S Thorpe, M P Richardson, RADAR-CNS Consortium, E Bruno, A Biondi, S Thorpe, M P Richardson, RADAR-CNS Consortium",2020 Oct,"Purpose:
        
      
      wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device.
    


          Method:
        
      
      patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0-12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological solutions are delivered to users.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32889512/,2022-11-27 11:29:53 PM
