0,Anatomical calibration for wearable motion capture systems: Video calibrated anatomical system technique,"Inertial sensors are becoming widely used for the assessment of human movement in both clinical and research applications, thanks to their usability out of the laboratory. This work aims to propose a method for calibrating anatomical landmark position in the wearable sensor reference frame with an ease to use, portable and low cost device. An off-the-shelf camera, a stick and a pattern, attached to the inertial sensor, compose the device. The proposed technique is referred to as video Calibrated Anatomical System Technique (vCAST). The absolute orientation of a synthetic femur was tracked both using the vCAST together with an inertial sensor and using stereo-photogrammetry as reference. Anatomical landmark calibration showed mean absolute error of 0.6±0.5 mm: these errors are smaller than those affecting the in-vivo identification of anatomical landmarks. The roll, pitch and yaw anatomical frame orientations showed root mean square errors close to the accuracy limit of the wearable sensor used (1°), highlighting the reliability of the proposed technique. In conclusion, the present paper proposes and preliminarily verifies the performance of a method (vCAST) for calibrating anatomical landmark position in the wearable sensor reference frame: the technique is low time consuming, highly portable, easy to implement and usable outside laboratory.",5
1,Implantation of an Innovative Intracardiac Microcomputer System for Web-Based Real-Time Monitoring of Heart Failure: Usability and Patients' Attitudes,"Background:
        
      
      Heart failure (HF) management guided by the measurement of intracardiac and pulmonary pressure values obtained through innovative permanent intracardiac microsensors has been recently proposed as a valid strategy to individualize treatment and anticipate hemodynamic destabilization. These sensors have potential to reduce patient hospitalization rates and optimize quality of life.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability and patients' attitudes toward a new permanent intracardiac device implanted to remotely monitor left intra-atrial pressures (V-LAP, Vectorious Medical Technologies, Tel Aviv, Israel) in patients with chronic HF.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The V-LAP system is a miniaturized sensor implanted percutaneously across the interatrial septum. The system communicates wirelessly with a ""companion device"" (a wearable belt) that is placed on the patient's chest at the time of acquisition/transmission of left heart pressure measurements. At first follow-up after implantation, the patients and health care providers were asked to fill out a questionnaire on the usability of the system, ease in performing the various required tasks (data acquisition and transmission), and overall satisfaction. Replies to the questions were mainly given using a 5-point Likert scale (1: very poor, 2: poor, 3: average, 4: good, 5: excellent). Further patient follow-ups were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Use and acceptance of the first 14 patients receiving the V-LAP technology worldwide and related health care providers have been analyzed to date. No periprocedural morbidity/mortality was observed. Before discharge, a tailored educational session was performed after device implantation with the patients and their health care providers. At the first follow-up, the mean score for overall comfort in technology use was 3.7 (SD 1.2) with 93% (13/14) of patients succeeding in applying and operating the system independently. For health care providers, the mean score for overall ease and comfort in use of the technology was 4.2 (SD 0.8). No significant differences were found between the patients' and health care providers' replies to the questionnaires. There was a general trend for higher scores in patients' usability reports at later follow-ups, in which the score related to overall comfort with using the technology increased from 3.0 (SD 1.4) to 4.0 (SD 0.7) (P=.40) and comfort with wearing and adjusting the measuring thoracic belt increased from 2.8 (SD 1.0) to 4.2 (SD 0.4) (P=.02).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the gravity of their HF pathology and the complexity of their comorbid profile, patients are comfortable in using the V-LAP technology and, in the majority of cases, they can correctly and consistently acquire and transmit hemodynamic data. Although the overall patient/care provider satisfaction with the V-LAP system seems to be acceptable, improvements can be achieved after ameliorating the design of the measuring tools.

2,A Novel 12-Lead Electrocardiographic System for Home Use: Development and Usability Testing,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis is of pivotal importance for patients with cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia to minimize the consequences like strokes and myocardial infarctions. The chance of capturing signals of arrhythmias or ischemia is substantially high when a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can be recorded at the moment when a patient experiences the symptoms. However, until now, available diagnostic systems (Holter monitors and other wearable ECG sensors) have not enabled patients to record a reliable 12-lead ECG at home.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly system that enables persons with cardiac complaints to record a reliable 12-lead ECG at home to improve the diagnostic process and, consequently, reduce the time between the onset of symptoms and adequate treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using an iterative design approach, ECGraph was developed. The system consists of an ECG measurement system and a mobile app, which were developed with the help of several concept tests. To evaluate the design, a prototype of the final design was built and a final technical performance test and usability test were executed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ECG measurement system consists of a belt and 4 limb straps. Ten wet Ag/AgCl electrodes are placed in the belt to optimize skin-electrode contact. The product is controlled via an app on the mobile phone of the user. Once a person experiences symptoms, he or she can put on the belt and record ECGs within a few minutes. Short instructions, supported by visualizations, offer guidance during use. ECGs are sent wirelessly to the caregiver, and the designated expert can quickly interpret the results. Usability tests with the final prototype (n=6) showed that the participants were able to put on the product within 8 minutes during first-time use. However, we expect that the placement of the product can be executed faster when the user becomes more familiar with the product. Areas of improvement focus mainly on confidence during product use. In the technical performance test, a 12-lead ECG was made and reproduced 6 times.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We developed a new 12-lead ECG system for home use. The product is expected to be more user-friendly than current hospital ECG systems and is designed to record more reliable data than current ECG systems for home use, which makes it suitable for expert interpretation. The system has great potential to be incorporated into an outpatient practice, so that arrhythmias and ischemia can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.",0
3,The effect of a wearable soft-robotic glove on motor function and functional performance of older adults,"Reduced grip strength, resulting in difficulties in performing daily activities, is a common problem in the population of older adults. Newly developed soft-robotic devices have the potential to support older adults with reduced grip in daily activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct, assistive effect of grip support from the wearable, soft-robotic ironHand glove.In total, 65 older adults with self-reported decline of hand function resulting from various disorders participated in this cross-sectional study. They performed various hand function tests with and without the glove during a single session. At the end, usability was scored.Participants were able to produce more pinch strength with the glove compared to without glove (p ≤ 0.001) and usability was rated very positively. However, this was not reflected in improved functional performance with the glove, as measured with timed tasks (p < 0.001). Furthermore, no correlation was found between baseline handgrip strength and changes in performance (between without and with glove) of all assessments (ρ ≤ 0.137, p ≥ 0.288).Further design adaptations are desired and more research is needed to investigate if performance with the glove can improve, when taking quality of task performance into account, or when applying a longer acquaintance period with the glove.",5
4,Assessing the Involvement of Users During Development of Lower Limb Wearable Robotic Exoskeletons: A Survey Study,"Objective:
        
      
      To explore user-centered design methods currently implemented during development of lower limb wearable robots and how they are utilized during different stages of product development.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Currently, there appears to be a lack of standardized frameworks for evaluation methods and design requirements to implement effective user-centered design for safe and effective clinical or ergonomic system application.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Responses from a total of 191 experts working in the field of lower limb exoskeletons were analyzed in this exploratory survey. Descriptive statistics were used to present responses and measures of frequency, and chi-square tests were used to contrast the answers of respondents who identified as clinicians versus engineers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A vast majority of respondents involve users in their development, in particular at the initial and iterative stages, although some differences were found between disciplines. A variety of methods and metrics are used to capture feedback from users and test devices, and although valuable, some methods used may not be based on validated measures. Guidelines regarding tests on safety of exoskeletons also lack standardization.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There seems to be a consensus among experts regarding the importance of a user-centered approach in exoskeleton development; however, standardized frameworks with regard to appropriate testing methods and design approaches are lacking. Such frameworks should consider an interdisciplinary focus on the needs and safety of the intended user during each iteration of the process.
    


          Application:
        
      
      This exploratory study provides an overview of current practice among engineers and clinicians regarding the user-centered design of exoskeletons. Limitations and recommendations for future directions are identified.",3
5,Using Google Glass in Surgical Settings: Systematic Review,"Background:
        
      
      In recent years, wearable devices have become increasingly attractive and the health care industry has been especially drawn to Google Glass because of its ability to serve as a head-mounted wearable device. The use of Google Glass in surgical settings is of particular interest due to the hands-free device potential to streamline workflow and maintain sterile conditions in an operating room environment.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim is to conduct a systematic evaluation of the literature on the feasibility and acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings and to assess the potential benefits and limitations of its application.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The literature was searched for articles published between January 2013 and May 2017. The search included the following databases: PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO (EBSCO), and IEEE Xplore. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles. Original research articles that evaluated the feasibility, usability, or acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings were included. This review was completed following the Preferred Reporting Results of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 520 records obtained, 31 met all predefined criteria and were included in this review. Google Glass was used in various surgical specialties. Most studies were in the United States (23/31, 74%) and all were conducted in hospital settings: 29 in adult hospitals (29/31, 94%) and two in children's hospitals (2/31, 7%). Sample sizes of participants who wore Google Glass ranged from 1 to 40. Of the 31 studies, 25 (81%) were conducted under real-time conditions or actual clinical care settings, whereas the other six (19%) were conducted under simulated environment. Twenty-six studies were pilot or feasibility studies (84%), three were case studies (10%), and two were randomized controlled trials (6%). The majority of studies examined the potential use of Google Glass as an intraoperative intervention (27/31, 87%), whereas others observed its potential use in preoperative (4/31, 13%) and postoperative settings (5/31, 16%). Google Glass was utilized as a videography and photography device (21/31, 68%), a vital sign monitor (6/31, 19%), a surgical navigation display (5/31, 16%), and as a videoconferencing tool to communicate with remote surgeons intraoperatively (5/31, 16%). Most studies reported moderate or high acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings. The main reported limitations of using Google Glass utilization were short battery life (8/31, 26%) and difficulty with hands-free features (5/31, 16%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are promising feasibility and usability data of using Google Glass in surgical settings with particular benefits for surgical education and training. Despite existing technical limitations, Google Glass was generally well received and several studies in surgical settings acknowledged its potential for training, consultation, patient monitoring, and audiovisual recording.",4
6,Wearable Devices and Smartphones for Activity Tracking Among People with Serious Mental Illness,"Introduction:
        
      
      People with serious mental illness, including schizophrenia spectrum and mood disorders, are more physically inactive than people from the general population. Emerging wearable devices and smartphone applications afford opportunities for promoting physical activity in this group. This exploratory mixed methods study obtained feedback from participants with serious mental illness to assess the acceptability of using wearable devices and smartphones to support a lifestyle intervention targeting weight loss.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants with serious mental illness and obesity enrolled in a 6-month lifestyle intervention were given Fitbit activity tracking devices and smartphones to use for the study. Participants completed quantitative post-intervention usability and satisfaction surveys, and provided qualitative feedback regarding acceptability of using these devices and recommendations for improvement through in-depth interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eleven participants wore Fitbits for an average of 84.7% (SD=18.1%) of the days enrolled in the study (median=93.8% of the days enrolled, interquartile range=83.6-94.3%). Participants were highly satisfied, stating that the devices encouraged them to be more physically active and were useful for self-monitoring physical activity and reaching daily step goals. Some participants experienced challenges using the companion mobile application on the smartphone, and recommended greater technical support, more detailed training, and group tutorials prior to using the devices.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Participants' perspectives highlight the feasibility and acceptability of using commercially available mHealth technologies to support health promotion efforts targeting people with serious mental illness. This study offers valuable insights for informing future research to assess the effectiveness of these devices for improving health outcomes in this high-risk group.",3
7,Examining the Use of Glucose and Physical Activity Self-Monitoring Technologies in Individuals at Moderate to High Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes: Randomized Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Self-monitoring of behavior (namely, diet and physical activity) and physiology (namely, glucose) has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes prevention. By combining self-monitoring technologies, the acute physiological consequences of behaviors could be shown, prompting greater consideration to physical activity levels today, which impact the risk of developing diabetes years or decades later. However, until recently, commercially available technologies have not been able to show individuals the health benefits of being physically active.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to examine the usage, feasibility, and acceptability of behavioral and physiological self-monitoring technologies in individuals at risk of developing T2D.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 45 adults aged ≥40 years and at moderate to high risk of T2D were recruited to take part in a 3-arm feasibility trial. Each participant was provided with a behavioral (Fitbit Charge 2) and physiological (FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitor) monitor for 6 weeks, masked according to group allocation. Participants were allocated to glucose feedback (4 weeks) followed by glucose and physical activity (biobehavioral) feedback (2 weeks; group 1), physical activity feedback (4 weeks) followed by biobehavioral feedback (2 weeks; group 2), or biobehavioral feedback (6 weeks; group 3). Participant usage (including time spent on the apps and number of glucose scans) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the feasibility (including recruitment and number of sensor displacements) and acceptability (including monitor wear time) of the intervention. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted at the 6-week follow-up appointment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For usage, time spent on the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre apps declined over the 6 weeks for all groups. Of the FreeStyle Libre sensor scans conducted by participants, 17% (1798/10,582) recorded rising or falling trends in glucose, and 24% (13/45) of participants changed ≥1 of the physical activity goals. For feasibility, 49% (22/45) of participants completed the study using the minimum number of FreeStyle Libre sensors, and a total of 41 sensors were declared faulty or displaced. For acceptability, participants wore the Fitbit for 40.1 (SD 3.2) days, and 20% (9/45) of participants and 53% (24/45) of participants were prompted by email to charge or sync the Fitbit, respectively. Interviews unearthed participant perceptions on the study design by suggesting refinements to the eligibility criteria and highlighting important issues about the usability, wearability, and features of the technologies.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Individuals at risk of developing T2D engaged with wearable digital health technologies providing behavioral and physiological feedback. Modifications are required to both the study and to commercially available technologies to maximize the chances of sustained usage and behavior change. The study and intervention were feasible to conduct and acceptable to most participants.

8,A Systematic Review of Wearable Patient Monitoring Systems - Current Challenges and Opportunities for Clinical Adoption,"The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54%). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30%), rehabilitation (7, 35%), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20%), falls (2, 10%) and mental health (1, 5%). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and 'silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.",2
9,Providing time-discrete gait information by wearable feedback apparatus for lower-limb amputees: usability and functional validation,"Here we describe a novel wearable feedback apparatus for lower-limb amputees. The system is based on three modules: a pressure-sensitive insole for the measurement of the plantar pressure distribution under the prosthetic foot during gait, a computing unit for data processing and gait segmentation, and a set of vibrating elements placed on the thigh skin. The feedback strategy relies on the detection of specific gait-phase transitions of the amputated leg. Vibrating elements are activated in a time-discrete manner, simultaneously with the occurrence of the detected gait-phase transitions. Usability and effectiveness of the apparatus were successfully assessed through an experimental validation involving ten healthy volunteers.",5
10,Wearable Immersive Virtual Reality Device for Promoting Physical Activity in Parkinson's Disease Patients,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that usually appears in the 6th decade of life and affects up to 2% of older people (65 years and older). Its therapeutic management is complex and includes not only pharmacological therapies but also physiotherapy. Exercise therapies have shown good results in disease management in terms of rehabilitation and/or maintenance of physical and functional capacities, which is important in PD. Virtual reality (VR) could promote physical activity in this population. We explore whether a commercial wearable head-mounted display (HMD) and the selected VR exergame could be suitable for people with mild-moderate PD. In all, 32 patients (78.1% men; 71.50 ± 11.80 years) were a part of the study. Outcomes were evaluated using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ post-game module), an ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire, and perceived effort. A total of 60 sessions were completed safely (without adverse effects (no SSQ symptoms) and with low scores in the negative experiences of the GEQ (0.01-0.09/4)), satisfaction opinions were positive (88% considered the training ""good"" or ""very good""), and the average usability of the wearable HMD was good (75.16/100). Our outcomes support the feasibility of a boxing exergame combined with a wearable commercial HMD as a suitable physical activity for PD and its applicability in different environments due to its safety, usability, low cost, and small size. Future research is needed focusing on postural instability, because it seems to be a symptom that could have an impact on the success of exergaming programs aimed at PD.",3
11,"Feasibility, Usability, and Effectiveness of a Machine Learning-Based Physical Activity Chatbot: Quasi-Experimental Study","Background:
        
      
      Behavioral eHealth and mobile health interventions have been moderately successful in increasing physical activity, although opportunities for further improvement remain to be discussed. Chatbots equipped with natural language processing can interact and engage with users and help continuously monitor physical activity by using data from wearable sensors and smartphones. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of chatbot interventions on physical activity.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of a machine learning-based physical activity chatbot.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A quasi-experimental design without a control group was conducted with outcomes evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. Participants wore a Fitbit Flex 1 (Fitbit LLC) and connected to the chatbot via the Messenger app. The chatbot provided daily updates on the physical activity level for self-monitoring, sent out daily motivational messages in relation to goal achievement, and automatically adjusted the daily goals based on physical activity levels in the last 7 days. When requested by the participants, the chatbot also provided sources of information on the benefits of physical activity, sent general motivational messages, and checked participants' activity history (ie, the step counts/min that were achieved on any day). Information about usability and acceptability was self-reported. The main outcomes were daily step counts recorded by the Fitbit and self-reported physical activity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 116 participants, 95 (81.9%) were female, 85 (73.3%) were in a relationship, 101 (87.1%) were White, and 82 (70.7%) were full-time workers. Their average age was 49.1 (SD 9.3) years with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2. Most experienced technical issues were due to an unexpected change in Facebook policy (93/113, 82.3%). Most of the participants scored the usability of the chatbot (101/113, 89.4%) and the Fitbit (99/113, 87.6%) as at least ""OK."" About one-third (40/113, 35.4%) would continue to use the chatbot in the future, and 53.1% (60/113) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more active. On average, 6.7 (SD 7.0) messages/week were sent to the chatbot and 5.1 (SD 7.4) min/day were spent using the chatbot. At follow-up, participants recorded more steps (increase of 627, 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and total physical activity (increase of 154.2 min/week; 3.58 times higher at follow-up; 95% CI 2.28-5.63). Participants were also more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines (odds ratio 6.37, 95% CI 3.31-12.27) at follow-up.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The machine learning-based physical activity chatbot was able to significantly increase participants' physical activity and was moderately accepted by the participants. However, the Facebook policy change undermined the chatbot functionality and indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot deployment to ensure successful delivery of this type of intervention.",3
12,Large-Scale Wearable Sensor Deployment in Parkinson's Patients: The Parkinson@Home Study Protocol,"Background:
        
      
      Long-term management of Parkinson's disease does not reach its full potential because we lack knowledge about individual variations in clinical presentation and disease progression. Continuous and longitudinal assessments in real-life (ie, within the patients' own home environment) might fill this knowledge gap.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The primary aim of the Parkinson@Home study is to evaluate the feasibility and compliance of using multiple wearable sensors to collect clinically relevant data. Our second aim is to address the usability of these data for answering clinical research questions. Finally, we aim to build a database for future validation of novel algorithms applied to sensor-derived data from Parkinson's patients during daily functioning.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Parkinson@Home study is a two-phase observational study involving 1000 Parkinson's patients and 250 physiotherapists. Disease status is assessed using a short version of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative protocol, performed by certified physiotherapists. Additionally, participants will wear a set of sensors (smartwatch, smartphone, and fall detector), and use these together with a customized smartphone app (Fox Insight), 24/7 for 3 months. The sensors embedded within the smartwatch and fall detector may be used to estimate physical activity, tremor, sleep quality, and falls. Medication intake and fall incidents will be measured via patients' self-reports in the smartphone app. Phase one will address the feasibility of the study protocol. In phase two, mathematicians will distill relevant summary statistics from the raw sensor signals, which will be compared against the clinical outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Recruitment of 300 participants for phase one was concluded in March, 2016, and the follow-up period will end in June, 2016. Phase two will include the remaining participants, and will commence in September, 2016.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The Parkinson@Home study is expected to generate new insights into the feasibility of integrating self-collected information from wearable sensors into both daily routines and clinical practices for Parkinson's patients. This study represents an important step towards building a reliable system that translates and integrates real-life information into clinical decisions, with the long-term aim of delivering personalized disease management support.

13,Using Inertial Sensors to Determine Head Motion-A Review,"Human activity recognition and classification are some of the most interesting research fields, especially due to the rising popularity of wearable devices, such as mobile phones and smartwatches, which are present in our daily lives. Determining head motion and activities through wearable devices has applications in different domains, such as medicine, entertainment, health monitoring, and sports training. In addition, understanding head motion is important for modern-day topics, such as metaverse systems, virtual reality, and touchless systems. The wearability and usability of head motion systems are more technologically advanced than those which use information from a sensor connected to other parts of the human body. The current paper presents an overview of the technical literature from the last decade on state-of-the-art head motion monitoring systems based on inertial sensors. This study provides an overview of the existing solutions used to monitor head motion using inertial sensors. The focus of this study was on determining the acquisition methods, prototype structures, preprocessing steps, computational methods, and techniques used to validate these systems. From a preliminary inspection of the technical literature, we observed that this was the first work which looks specifically at head motion systems based on inertial sensors and their techniques. The research was conducted using four internet databases-IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, MDPI, and Springer. According to this survey, most of the studies focused on analyzing general human activity, and less on a specific activity. In addition, this paper provides a thorough overview of the last decade of approaches and machine learning algorithms used to monitor head motion using inertial sensors. For each method, concept, and final solution, this study provides a comprehensive number of references which help prove the advantages and disadvantages of the inertial sensors used to read head motion. The results of this study help to contextualize emerging inertial sensor technology in relation to broader goals to help people suffering from partial or total paralysis of the body.",2
14,Usefulness of Magnetoinertial Wearable Devices in Neurorehabilitation of Children with Cerebral Palsy,"Background:
        
      
      Despite the increasing use of wearable magnetoinertial measurement units (MIMUs) for gait analysis, the efficacy of MIMU-based assessment for planning rehabilitation has not been adequately documented yet.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The usefulness of a MIMU-based assessment was evaluated comparing the data acquired by three MIMUs located at the pelvis, sternum, and head levels in 12 children with cerebral palsy (CP, age: 2-9 years) and 12 age-matched children with typical development (TD). Gait stability was quantified in terms of acceleration attenuation coefficients from pelvis to head, pelvis to sternum, and sternum to head. Children with CP were randomly divided in two groups: in the first group (CPI), MIMU-based parameters were used by therapists for planning patient-tailored rehabilitation programs, whereas in the second group (CPB), therapists were blind to the MIMU-based assessment results. Both CPI and CPB were tested before and after the relevant neurorehabilitation program. Ad hoc questionnaires were also administered to therapists of the CPI group to assess the degree of usefulness perceived about the information provided by the MIMU-based assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significant differences were found between children with CP and those with TD for the acceleration attenuation coefficient from pelvis to head (p = 0.048) and from pelvis to sternum (p = 0.021). After neurorehabilitation, this last parameter increased more in CPI (35%) than in CPB (6%, p = 0.017 for the interaction group per time). The results of the questionnaires showed that therapists agreed with the usability (100% judged it as ""easy to use"") and usefulness of the MIMU-based assessment in defining patient-oriented interventions (87%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is a large debate in literature about the efficacy of classical gait analysis that should be enlarged to new technological approaches, such as that based on MIMUs. This study is a first proof of concept about the efficacy of this approach for neurorehabilitation of children with CP.",0
15,Wearable 3-Lead Electrocardiogram Placement Model for Fleet Sizing of Medical Devices,"BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography (ECG) provides valuable information on astronaut physiological and psychological health. ECG monitoring has been conducted during crewed missions since the beginning of human spaceflight and will continue during astronauts upcoming long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs) in support of automated health monitoring systems. ECG monitoring is traditionally performed in clinical environments with single-use, adhesive electrodes in a 3, 6, or 12-lead configuration placed by a trained clinician. In the space exploration environment, astronauts self-place electrodes without professional assistance. Wearable ECG systems are an attractive option for automated health monitoring, but electrode placement has not been quantified to a high enough degree to avoid artifacts within the data due to position changes. This variability presents challenges for physician-limited, autonomous health monitoring, so quantifying electrode placement is key in the development of reliable, wearable ECG monitoring systems.METHODS: We present a method of quantifying electrode placement for 3-lead, chest-mounted ECG using easy-to-measure, two-dimensional chest measurements.RESULTS: We find that male and female dimensions require different electrode positioning computations, but there is overlap in positioning between men and women. The distribution of electrodes vertical positions is wider than their horizontal positions.DISCUSSION: These results can be translated directly to ECG wearable design for the individual and for the size range and adjustability required for the astronaut fleet. Implementation of this method will improve the reliability in placement and fit of future wearables, increasing comfort and usability of these systems and subsequently augmenting autonomous health monitoring capabilities for exploration medicine.Arquilla K, Leary S, Webb AK, Anderson AP.

16,Feasibility and Acceptability of Wearable Sleep Electroencephalogram Device Use in Adolescents: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Adolescence is an important life stage for the development of healthy behaviors, which have a long-lasting impact on health across the lifespan. Sleep undergoes significant changes during adolescence and is linked to physical and psychiatric health; however, sleep is rarely assessed in routine health care settings. Wearable sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) devices may represent user-friendly methods for assessing sleep among adolescents, but no studies to date have examined the feasibility and acceptability of sleep EEG wearables in this age group.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The goal of the research was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of sleep EEG wearable devices among adolescents aged 11 to 17 years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 104 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years participated in 7 days of at-home sleep recording using a self-administered wearable sleep EEG device (Zmachine Insight+, General Sleep Corporation) as well as a wristworn actigraph. Feasibility was assessed as the number of full nights of successful recording completed by adolescents, and acceptability was measured by the wearable acceptability survey for sleep. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed separately for the sleep EEG device and wristworn actigraph.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 94.2% (98/104) of adolescents successfully recorded at least 1 night of data using the sleep EEG device (mean number of nights 5.42; SD 1.71; median 6, mode 7). A total of 81.6% (84/103) rated the comfort of the device as falling in the comfortable to mildly uncomfortable range while awake. A total of 40.8% (42/103) reported typical sleep while using the device, while 39.8% (41/103) indicated minimal to mild device-related sleep disturbances. A minority (32/104, 30.8%) indicated changes in their sleep position due to device use, and very few (11/103, 10.7%) expressed dissatisfaction with their experience with the device. A similar pattern was observed for the wristworn actigraph device.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Wearable sleep EEG appears to represent a feasible, acceptable method for sleep assessment among adolescents and may have utility for assessing and treating sleep disturbances at a population level. Future studies with adolescents should evaluate strategies for further improving usability of such devices, assess relationships between sleep EEG-derived metrics and health outcomes, and investigate methods for incorporating data from these devices into emerging digital interventions and applications.

17,"Wearable technology in epilepsy: The views of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals","Purpose:
        
      
      In recent years, digital technology and wearable devices applied to seizure detection have progressively become available. In this study, we investigated the perspectives of people with epilepsy (PWE), caregivers (CG), and healthcare professionals (HP). We were interested in their current use of digital technology as well as their willingness to use wearables to monitor seizures. We also explored the role of factors influencing engagement with technology, including demographic and clinical characteristics, data confidentiality, need for technical support, and concerns about strain or increased workload.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An online survey drawing on previous data collected via focus groups was constructed and distributed via a web link. Using logistic regression analyses, demographic, clinical, and other factors identified to influence engagement with technology were correlated with reported use and willingness to use digital technology and wearables for seizure tracking.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighty-seven surveys were completed, fifty-two (59.7%) by PWE, 13 (14.4%) by CG, and 22 (25.3%) by HP. Responders were familiar with multiple digital technologies, including the Internet, smartphones, and personal computers, and the use of digital services was similar to the UK average. Moreover, age and disease-related factors did not influence access to digital technology. The majority of PWE were willing to use a wearable device for long-term seizure tracking. However, only a limited number of PWE reported current regular use of wearables, and nonusers attributed their choice to uncertainty about the usefulness of this technology in epilepsy care. People with epilepsy envisaged the possibility of understanding their condition better through wearables and considered, with caution, the option to send automatic emergency calls. Despite concerns around accuracy, data confidentiality, and technical support, these factors did not limit PWE's willingness to use digital technology. Caregivers appeared willing to provide support to PWE using wearables and perceived a reduction of their workload and anxiety. Healthcare professionals identified areas of application for digital technologies in their clinical practice, pending an appropriate reorganization of the clinical team to share the burden of data reviewing and handling.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Unlike people who have other chronic health conditions, PWE appeared not to be at risk of digital exclusion. This study highlighted a great interest in the use of wearable technology across epilepsy service users, carers, and healthcare professionals, which was independent of demographic and clinical factors and outpaced data security and technology usability concerns.",2
18,Exploring the Use of Mobile and Wearable Technology among University Student Athletes in Lebanon: A Cross-Sectional Study,"The markets of commercial wearables and health and fitness apps are constantly growing globally, especially among young adults and athletes, to track physical activity, energy expenditure and health. Despite their wide availability, evidence on use comes predominantly from the United States or Global North, with none targeting college student-athletes in low- and middle-income countries. This study was aimed to explore the use of these technologies among student-athletes at the American University of Beirut (AUB). We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 482 participants (average age 20 years) enrolled in 24 teams during Fall 2018; 230 students successfully completed the web-based survey, and 200 provided valid data. Fifty-three (26.5%) have owned a fitness tracker, mostly for self-monitoring. The most popular were Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Garmin. Similarly, 82 students (40%) used apps, primarily MyFitnessPal, Apple Health, and Samsung Health. Nevertheless, many participants discontinued use due to loss of interest or technical issues (breaking, usability, obsolescence, or lack of engagement). Wearable devices were considered superior to mobile phones alone as physical activity monitors. However, forming regular habits made self-monitoring via technology irrelevant. Further research is needed to better understand what motivates continuous use among student-athletes, who could use trackers to improve athletic performance and overall health.",1
19,Wearable Haptics and Immersive Virtual Reality Rehabilitation Training in Children With Neuromotor Impairments,"The past decade has seen the emergence of rehabilitation treatments using virtual reality (VR) environments although translation into clinical practice has been limited so far. In this paper, an immersive VR rehabilitation training system endowed with wearable haptics is proposed for children with neuromotor impairments: it aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients, to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises and to benefit from the flexibility of VR in adapting exercises to the patient's need. An experimental rehabilitation session conducted with children with cerebral palsy (CP) and developmental dyspraxia (DD) has been performed to evaluate the usability of the system and proof of concept trial of the proposed approach. We compared CP/DD performance with both typically developing children and adult control group. Results show the system was compliant with different levels of motor skills and allowed patients to complete the experimental rehabilitation session, with performance varying according to the expected motor abilities of different groups. Moreover, a kinematic assessmentbased on the presented system has been designed. Obtained results reflected different motor abilities of patients and participants, suggesting suitability of the proposed kinematic assessment as a motor function outcome.",1
20,Usability of a novel digital medicine system in adults with schizophrenia treated with sensor-embedded tablets of aripiprazole,"Objective:
        
      
      Digital medicine system (DMS) is a novel drug-device combination that objectively measures and reports medication ingestion. The DMS consists of medication embedded with an ingestible sensor (digital medicine), a wearable sensor, and software applications. This study evaluated usability of the DMS in adults with schizophrenia rated by both patients and their health care providers (HCPs) during 8-week treatment with prescribed doses of digital aripiprazole.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six US sites enrolled outpatients into this Phase IIa, open-label study (NCT02219009). The study comprised a screening phase, a training phase (three weekly site visits), and a 5-week independent phase. Patients and HCPs independently rated usability of and satisfaction with the DMS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-seven patients were enrolled, and 49 (73.1%) patients completed the study. The mean age (SD) of the patients was 46.6 years (9.7 years); the majority of them were male (74.6%), black (76.1%), and rated mildly ill on the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (70.1%). By the end of week 8 or early termination, 82.1% (55/67) of patients had replaced the wearable sensor independently or with minimal assistance, based on HCP rating. The patients used the wearable sensor for a mean (SD) of 70.7% (24.7%) and a median of 77.8% of their time in the trial. The patients contacted a call center most frequently at week 1. At the last visit, 78% (47/60) of patients were somewhat satisfied/satisfied/extremely satisfied with the DMS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A high proportion of patients with schizophrenia were able to use the DMS and reported satisfaction with the DMS. These data support the potential utility of the DMS in clinical practice.",6
21,"Measurement, Prediction, and Control of Individual Heart Rate Responses to Exercise-Basics and Options for Wearable Devices","The use of wearable devices or ""wearables"" in the physical activity domain has been increasing in the last years. These devices are used as training tools providing the user with detailed information about individual physiological responses and feedback to the physical training process. Advantages in sensor technology, miniaturization, energy consumption and processing power increased the usability of these wearables. Furthermore, available sensor technologies must be reliable, valid, and usable. Considering the variety of the existing sensors not all of them are suitable to be integrated in wearables. The application and development of wearables has to consider the characteristics of the physical training process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency as training tools. During physical training, it is essential to elicit individual optimal strain to evoke the desired adjustments to training. One important goal is to neither overstrain nor under challenge the user. Many wearables use heart rate as indicator for this individual strain. However, due to a variety of internal and external influencing factors, heart rate kinetics are highly variable making it difficult to control the stress eliciting individually optimal strain. For optimal training control it is essential to model and predict individual responses and adapt the external stress if necessary. Basis for this modeling is the valid and reliable recording of these individual responses. Depending on the heart rate kinetics and the obtained physiological data, different models and techniques are available that can be used for strain or training control. Aim of this review is to give an overview of measurement, prediction, and control of individual heart rate responses. Therefore, available sensor technologies measuring the individual heart rate responses are analyzed and approaches to model and predict these individual responses discussed. Additionally, the feasibility for wearables is analyzed.",0
22,Optimizing Telehealth Experience Design Through Usability Testing in Hispanic American and African American Patient Populations: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Telehealth-delivered pulmonary rehabilitation (telePR) has been shown to be as effective as standard pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) at improving the quality of life in patients living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it is not known how effective telePR may prove to be among low-income, urban Hispanic American and African American patient populations. To address this question, a collaborative team at Northwell Health developed a telePR intervention and assessed its efficacy among low-income Hispanic American and African American patient populations. The telePR intervention system components included an ergonomic recumbent bike, a tablet with a built-in camera, and wireless monitoring devices.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of the study was to assess patient adoption and diminish barriers to use by initiating a user-centered design approach, which included usability testing to refine the telePR intervention prior to enrolling patients with COPD into a larger telePR study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Usability testing was conducted in two phases to identify opportunities to streamline and improve the patient experience. The first phase included a prefield usability testing phase to evaluate technical, patient safety, and environmental factors comprising the system architecture. This was followed by an ergonomic evaluation of user interactions with the bicycle, telehealth tablets, and connected wearable devices to ensure optimal placement and practical support for all components of the intervention. The second phase of research included feasibility testing to observe and further optimize the system based on iterative rounds of telePR sessions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During usability and feasibility research, we identified and addressed multiple opportunities for system improvements. These included physical and environmental changes, modifications to accommodate individual patient factors, safety improvements, and technology upgrades. Each enrolled patient was subsequently identified and classified into one of the following 3 categories: (1) independent, (2) intermediate, or (3) dependent. This categorization was used to predict the level of training and support needed for successful participation in the telePR sessions. Feasibility results revealed that patients in the dependent category were unable to perform the rehab sessions without in-person support due to low technical acumen and difficulty with certain features of the system, even after modifications had been made. Intermediate and independent users, however, did exhibit increased independent utilization of telePR due to iterative improvements.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Usability testing helped reduce barriers to use for two subsets of our population, the intermediate and independent users. In addition, it identified a third subset, dependent users, for whom the telePR solution was deemed unsuitable without in-person support. The study established the need for the development of standard operating procedures, and guides were created for both patients and remote respiratory therapists to facilitate the appropriate use of the telePR system intervention. Observational research also led to the development of standard protocols for the first and all subsequent telePR sessions. The primary goals in developing standardization protocols were to establish trust, ensure a positive experience, and encourage future patient engagement with telePR sessions.",4
23,"The role of individual differences on perceptions of wearable fitness device trust, usability, and motivational impact","Lack of physical activity is a severe health concern in the United States with fewer than half of all Americans meeting the recommended weekly physical activity guidelines. Although wearable fitness devices can be effective in motivating people to be active, consumers are abandoning this technology soon after purchase. We examined the impact of several user (i.e. personality, age, computer self-efficacy, physical activity level) and device characteristics (trust, usability, and motivational affordances) on the behavioral intentions to use a wearable fitness device. Novice users completed a brief interaction with a fitness device similar to a first purchase experience before completing questionnaires about their interaction. We found computer self-efficacy, physical activity level, as well as personality traits indirectly increased the desire to use a fitness device and influenced the saliency of perceived motivational affordances. Additionally, trust, usability, and perceived motivational affordances were associated with increased intentions to use fitness devices.",3
24,A Wearable Sensor-Based Exercise Biofeedback System: Mixed Methods Evaluation of Formulift,"Background:
        
      
      Formulift is a newly developed mobile health (mHealth) app that connects to a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) worn on the left thigh. The IMU captures users' movements as they exercise, and the app analyzes the data to count repetitions in real time and classify users' exercise technique. The app also offers feedback and guidance to users on exercising safely and effectively.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to assess the Formulift system with three different and realistic types of potential users (beginner gym-goers, experienced gym-goers, and qualified strength and conditioning [S&C] coaches) under a number of categories: (1) usability, (2) functionality, (3) the perceived impact of the system, and (4) the subjective quality of the system. It was also desired to discover suggestions for future improvements to the system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 15 healthy volunteers participated (12 males; 3 females; age: 23.8 years [SD 1.80]; height: 1.79 m [SD 0.07], body mass: 78.4 kg [SD 9.6]). Five participants were beginner gym-goers, 5 were experienced gym-goers, and 5 were qualified and practicing S&C coaches. IMU data were first collected from each participant to create individualized exercise classifiers for them. They then completed a number of nonexercise-related tasks with the app. Following this, a workout was completed using the system, involving squats, deadlifts, lunges, and single-leg squats. Participants were then interviewed about their user experience and completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Thematic analysis was completed on all interview transcripts, and survey results were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Qualitative and quantitative analysis found the system has ""good"" to ""excellent"" usability. The system achieved a mean (SD) SUS usability score of 79.2 (8.8). Functionality was also deemed to be good, with many users reporting positively on the systems repetition counting, technique classification, and feedback. A number of bugs were found, and other suggested changes to the system were also made. The overall subjective quality of the app was good, with a median star rating of 4 out of 5 (interquartile range, IQR: 3-5). Participants also reported that the system would aid their technique, provide motivation, reassure them, and help them avoid injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrated an overall positive evaluation of Formulift in the categories of usability, functionality, perceived impact, and subjective quality. Users also suggested a number of changes for future iterations of the system. These findings are the first of their kind and show great promise for wearable sensor-based exercise biofeedback systems.",3

The aim is to generate knowledge on usage, usability and technical requirements to harvest the potential benefits of using wearable and mobile technologies in care for safe and active living. The study is based on real life pilots in three Norwegian municipalities with 71 users, their caregivers and relatives. Pilot users wore the mobile safety alarm while performing their daily activities - indoor and outdoor. The study shows increased safety to users, their relatives and caregivers and increased activity and mobility indicating improved social and physical health. Further development of wearables and mobile technologies is requested to meet user needs, and the inclusion of relatives imposes new challenges in terms of privacy. Mobile safety alarms represent a huge potential for efficiency and innovation in integrated care, but new tools are required for efficient collaboration and operation for large-scale implementations.",4
26,Wearable gait analysis systems: ready to be used by medical practitioners in geriatric wards?,"Purpose:
        
      
      We assess feasibility of wearable gait analysis in geriatric wards by testing the effectiveness and acceptance of the system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Gait parameters of 83 patients (83.34 ± 5.88 years, 58/25 female/male) were recorded at admission and/or discharge to/from two geriatric inpatient wards. Gait parameters were tested for statistically significant differences between admission and discharge. Walking distance measured by a wearable gait analysis system was correlated with distance assessed by physiotherapists. Examiners rated usability using the system usability scale. Patients reported acceptability on a five-point Likert-scale.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total distance measures highly correlate (r = 0.89). System Usability Scale is above the median threshold of 68, indicating good usability. Majority of patients does not have objections regarding the use of the system. Among other gait parameters, mean heel strike angle changes significantly between admission and discharge.
    


          Conclusion:

27,SnapKi-An Inertial Easy-to-Adapt Wearable Textile Device for Movement Quantification of Neurological Patients,"The development of wearable health systems has been the focus of many researchers who aim to find solutions in healthcare. Additionally, the large potential of textiles to integrate electronics, together with the comfort and usability they provide, has contributed to the development of smart garments in this area. In the field of neurological disorders with motor impairment, clinicians look for wearable devices that may provide quantification of movement symptoms. Neurological disorders affect different motion abilities thus requiring different needs in movement quantification. With this background we designed and developed an inertial textile-embedded wearable device that is adaptable to different movement-disorders quantification requirements. This adaptative device is composed of a low-power 9-axis inertial unit, a customised textile band and a web and Android cross application used for data collection, debug and calibration. The textile band comprises a snap buttons system that allows the attachment of the inertial unit, as well as its connection with the analog sensors through conductive textile. The resulting system is easily adaptable for quantification of multiple motor symptoms in different parts of the body, such as rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia assessments, gait analysis, among others. In our project, the system was applied for a specific use-case of wrist rigidity quantification during Deep Brain Stimulation surgeries, showing its high versatility and receiving very positive feedback from patients and doctors.",0
28,Wearable Sensor-Based Exercise Biofeedback for Orthopaedic Rehabilitation: A Mixed Methods User Evaluation of a Prototype System,"The majority of wearable sensor-based biofeedback systems used in exercise rehabilitation lack end-user evaluation as part of the development process. This study sought to evaluate an exemplar sensor-based biofeedback system, investigating the feasibility, usability, perceived impact and user experience of using the platform. Fifteen patients participated in the study having recently undergone knee replacement surgery. Participants were provided with the system for two weeks at home, completing a semi-structured interview alongside the System Usability Scale (SUS) and user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). The analysis from the SUS (mean = 90.8 [SD = 7.8]) suggests a high degree of usability, supported by qualitative findings. The mean adherence rate was 79% with participants reporting a largely positive user experience, suggesting it offers additional support with the rehabilitation regime. Overall quality from the mean uMARS score was 4.1 out of 5 (SD = 0.39), however a number of bugs and inaccuracies were highlighted along with suggestions for additional features to enhance engagement. This study has shown that patients perceive value in the use of wearable sensor-based biofeedback systems and has highlighted the benefit of user-evaluation during the design process, illustrated the need for real-world accuracy validation, and supports the ongoing development of such systems.",0
29,Development and usability of a personalized sensor-based system for pervasive healthcare,"Although a plethora of remote health monitoring systems have been proposed for chronic conditions, the challenge posed by the changing patient needs and the requirement for personalization in health monitoring to move beyond proprietary, difficult to extend, and unsustainable solutions still pertains. In this direction, we describe a mobile health system based on a smartphone, portable/wearable sensors for measuring the patient's physiological parameters, and back-end platforms for the health professionals to monitor the patient condition and configure monitoring plans in an individualized manner. A prototype system was developed based on a Service-oriented Architecture and integrating commercially available sensing devices. An experimental study has been conducted with 53 patients in order to investigate the usability of the proposed system. The patients were able to perform the majority of the target tasks successfully (Success Rate = 77%), while the perceived usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS) was found to be above average (SUS score = 73%), indicating that the patients overall perceived the system as both easy to use and useful.",2
30,Fluid Intake Monitoring Systems for the Elderly: A Review of the Literature,"Fluid intake monitoring is an essential component in preventing dehydration and overhydration, especially for the senior population. Numerous critical health problems are associated with poor or excessive drinking such as swelling of the brain and heart failure. Real-time systems for monitoring fluid intake will not only measure the exact amount consumed by the users, but could also motivate people to maintain a healthy lifestyle by providing feedback to encourage them to hydrate regularly throughout the day. This paper reviews the most recent solutions to automatic fluid intake monitoring both commercially and in the literature. The available technologies are divided into four categories: wearables, surfaces with embedded sensors, vision- and environmental-based solutions, and smart containers. A detailed performance evaluation was carried out considering detection accuracy, usability and availability. It was observed that the most promising results came from studies that used data fusion from multiple technologies, compared to using an individual technology. The areas that need further research and the challenges for each category are discussed in detail.",2
31,Mobile and Wearable Device Features that Matter in Promoting Physical Activity,"Background:
        
      
      As wearable sensors/devices become increasingly popular to promote physical activity (PA), research is needed to examine how and which components of these devices people use to increase their PA levels.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      (1) To assess usability and level of engagement with the Fitbit One and daily SMS-based prompts in a 6-week PA intervention, and (2) to examine whether use/ level of engagement with specific intervention components were associated with PA change.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were analyzed from a randomized controlled trial that compared (1) a wearable sensor/ device (Fitbit One) plus SMS-based PA prompts, and (2) Fitbit One only, among overweight/ obese adults (N = 67). We calculated average scores from Likert-type response items that assessed usability and level of engagement with device features (e.g., tracker, website, mobile app, and SMS-based prompts), and assessed whether such factors were associated with change in steps/day (using Actigraph GT3X+).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants reported the Fitbit One was easy to use and the tracker helped to be more active. Those who used the Fitbit mobile app (36%) vs. those who did not (64%) had an increase in steps at 6-week follow-up, even after adjusting for previous web/app use: +545 steps/ day (SE = 265) vs. -28 steps/ day (SE = 242) (p = .04).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Level of engagement with the Fitbit One, particularly the mobile app, was associated with increased steps. Mobile apps can instantly display summaries of PA performance and could optimize self-regulation to activate change. More research is needed to determine whether such modalities might be cost-effective in future intervention research and practice.",3
32,StraightenUp+: Monitoring of Posture during Daily Activities for Older Persons Using Wearable Sensors,"Monitoring the posture of older persons using portable sensors while they carry out daily activities can facilitate the process of generating indicators with which to evaluate their health and quality of life. The majority of current research into such sensors focuses primarily on their functionality and accuracy, and minimal effort is dedicated to understanding the experience of older persons who interact with the devices. This study proposes a wearable device to identify the bodily postures of older persons, while also looking into the perceptions of the users. For the purposes of this study, thirty independent and semi-independent older persons undertook eight different types of physical activity, including: walking, raising arms, lowering arms, leaning forward, sitting, sitting upright, transitioning from standing to sitting, and transitioning from sitting to standing. The data was classified offline, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%, while overall device user perception was positive. Participants rated the usability of the device, in addition to their overall user experience, highly.",3
33,Typing on a Smartwatch While Mobile: A Comparison of Input Methods,"Objective:
        
      
      The user experience of typing on a smartwatch was evaluated with three unique input methods (tap, trace, and handwriting) while standing and while walking.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Despite widespread development within the technology industry, smartwatches have had a relatively slow adoption worldwide compared to smartphones. One limiting factor of smartwatches has been the lack of an efficient means of text entry. The 2017 release of Android Wear addressed this issue by providing support for native text entry (i.e., tap, trace, and handwriting). Determining how user performance and subjective ratings compare across these input methods is essential to understanding their contribution to smartwatch user experience.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Twenty college-age individuals typed phrases using tap, trace, and handwriting input on a smartwatch in three different mobility scenarios (standing, walking a simple course, walking a complex course).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants typed faster with trace (30 words per minute; WPM) than with tap (20 WPM) and handwriting (18 WPM), regardless of mobility. Trace also outperformed tap and handwriting across all subjective metrics, regardless of mobility.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Trace input appears to be especially well suited for typing on a smartwatch as it was found to be objectively and subjectively superior to tap and handwriting regardless of user mobility. Objectively, typing speeds with trace are shown to be nearly two times faster than most alternative input methods described in the literature.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Results suggest smartwatch manufacturers should include QWERTY keyboards with trace input as a standard feature in order to provide the best overall typing experience for their users.",3
34,Validation of a Hybrid Exoskeleton for Upper Limb Rehabilitation. A Preliminary Study,"Recovery of therapeutic or functional ambulatory capacity in patients with rotator cuff injury is a primary goal of rehabilitation. Wearable powered exoskeletons allow patients to perform repetitive practice with large movements to maximize recovery, even immediately after the acute event. The aim of this paper is to describe the usability, acceptability and acceptance of a hybrid exoskeleton for upper-limb passive rehabilitation using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. This equipment, called ExoFlex, is defined as a hybrid exoskeleton since it is made up of rigid and soft components. The exoskeleton mechanical description is presented along with its control system and the way motion is structured in rehabilitation sessions. Seven patients (six women and one man) have participated in the evaluation of this equipment, which are in the range of 50 to 79 years old. Preliminary evidence of the acceptance and usability by both patients and clinicians are very promising, obtaining an average score of 80.71 in the SUS test, as well as good results in a questionnaire that evaluates the clinicians' perceived usability of ExoFlex.",3
35,"Capturing Rest-Activity Profiles in Schizophrenia Using Wearable and Mobile Technologies: Development, Implementation, Feasibility, and Acceptability of a Remote Monitoring Platform","Background:
        
      
      There is growing interest in the potential for wearable and mobile devices to deliver clinically relevant information in real-world contexts. However, there is limited information on their acceptability and barriers to long-term use in people living with psychosis.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to describe the development, implementation, feasibility, acceptability, and user experiences of the Sleepsight platform, which harnesses consumer wearable devices and smartphones for the passive and unobtrusive capture of sleep and rest-activity profiles in people with schizophrenia living in their homes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 15 outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia used a consumer wrist-worn device and smartphone to continuously and remotely gather rest-activity profiles over 2 months. Once-daily sleep and self-rated symptom diaries were also collected via a smartphone app. Adherence with the devices and smartphone app, end-of-study user experiences, and agreement between subjective and objective sleep measures were analyzed. Thresholds for acceptability were set at a wear time or diary response rate of 70% or greater.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 14 out of 15 participants completed the study. In individuals with a mild to moderate symptom severity at baseline (mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score 58.4 [SD 14.4]), we demonstrated high rates of engagement with the wearable device (all participants meeting acceptability criteria), sleep diary, and symptom diary (93% and 86% meeting criteria, respectively), with negative symptoms being associated with lower diary completion rate. The end-of-study usability and acceptability questionnaire and qualitative analysis identified facilitators and barriers to long-term use, and paranoia with study devices was not a significant barrier to engagement. Comparison between sleep diary and wearable estimated sleep times showed good correspondence (ρ=0.50, P<.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Extended use of wearable and mobile technologies are acceptable to people with schizophrenia living in a community setting. In the future, these technologies may allow predictive, objective markers of clinical status, including early markers of impending relapse.",6
36,Rearrangeable and exchangeable optical module with system-on-chip for wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy system,"We developed a system-on-chip (SoC)-incorporated light-emitting diode (LED) and avalanche photodiode (APD) modules to improve the usability and flexibility of a fiberless wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. The SoC has a microprocessing unit and programmable circuits. The time division method and the lock-in method were used for separately detecting signals from different positions and signals of different wavelengths, respectively. Each module autonomously works for this time-divided-lock-in measurement with a high sensitivity for haired regions. By supplying [Formula: see text] of power and base and data clocks, the LED module emits both 730- and 855-nm wavelengths of light, amplitudes of which are modulated in each lock-in frequency generated from the base clock, and the APD module provides the lock-in detected signals synchronizing with the data clock. The SoC provided many functions, including automatic-power-control of the LED, automatic judgment of detected power level, and automatic-gain-control of the programmable gain amplifier. The number and the arrangement of modules can be adaptively changed by connecting this exchangeable modules in a daisy chain and setting the parameters dependent on the probing position. Therefore, users can configure a variety of arrangements (single- or multidistance combinations) of them with this module-based system.",0
37,Analysis of sensorimotor control in people with and without neck pain using inertial sensor technology: study protocol for a 1-year longitudinal prospective observational study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Neck pain is a very common musculoskeletal disorder associated with high socioeconomic costs derived from work absenteeism and medical expenses. Previous studies have suggested that patients with neck pain of different origins present sensorimotor control impairments compared with the asymptomatic population. However, there is a small number of published studies focusing on these with conflicting results. In addition, the existing methodological limitations highlight the need for more and better quality studies. Moreover, longitudinal studies are necessary to investigate whether changes in pain or disability in individuals with chronic neck pain over time associate with changes in cervical sensorimotor control.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      This is a descriptive, observational, longitudinal, prospective study consecutively enrolling 52 patients with non-specific neck pain and 52 age-matched asymptomatic participants.Intensity of pain, neck disability, duration of symptoms, topography of pain and comorbidities will be registered at baseline. Sensorimotor control variables including active range of motion, movement speed, acceleration, smoothness of motion, head repositioning accuracy and motion coupling patterns will be recorded as primary outcomes by means of inertial sensors during the following tests consecutively performed in two sessions separated by 12 months: (1) kinematics of planar movements, (2) kinematics of the craniocervical flexion movement, (3) kinematics during functional tasks and (4) kinematics of task-oriented neck movements in response to visual targets.Secondary outcomes will include: (1) Regular physical activity levels, (2) Kinesiophobia, (3) Symptoms related to central sensitisation and (4) The usability of the inertial measurement unit sensor technology.

38,Design of Semirigid Wearable Devices Based on Skin Strain Analysis,"Nowadays, both usability and comfort play a key role in the development of medical and wearable products. When designing any device that is in contact with the human body, the mechanical behavior of the embraced soft tissue must be known. The unavoidable displacement of the soft tissue during motion may lead to discomfort and, thus, the removal of the wearable product. This paper presents a new methodology to design and test a wearable device based on the measurement of the dynamic skin strain field. Furthermore, from this field, the anatomical lines with minimum strain (lines of nonextension (LoNEs)) are calculated to design the structural parts of the wearable device. With this new criterion, the resulting product is not only optimized to reduce the friction in skin-device interface, but fully personalized to the patient's morphology and motion. The methodology is applied to the design of an ankle-foot wearable orthosis for subjects with ankle dorsiflexors muscles weakness due to nervous system disorders. The results confirm that the use of LoNEs may benefit the design of products with a high interaction with the skin.",0
39,Usability of a Wrist-Worn Smartwatch in a Direct-to-Participant Randomized Pragmatic Clinical Trial,"Background:
        
      
      The availability of a wide range of innovative wearable sensor technologies today allows for the ability to capture and collect potentially important health-related data in ways not previously possible. These sensors can be adopted in digitalized clinical trials, i.e., clinical trials conducted outside the clinic to capture data about study participants in their day-to-day life. However, having participants activate, charge, and wear the digital sensors for long hours may prove to be a significant obstacle to the success of these trials.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study explores a broad question of wrist-wearable sensor effectiveness in terms of data collection as well as data that are analyzable per individual. The individuals who had already consented to be part of an asymptomatic atrial fibrillation screening trial were directly sent a wrist-wearable activity and heart rate tracker device to be activated and used in a home-based setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 230 participants with a median age of 71 years were asked to wear the wristband as frequently as possible, night and day, for at least a 4-month monitoring period, especially to track heart rhythm during sleep.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the individuals who received the device, 43% never transmitted any data. Those who used the device wore it a median of ∼15 weeks (IQR 2-24) and for 5.3 days (IQR 3.2-6.5) per week. For rhythm detection purposes, only 5.6% of all recorded data from individuals were analyzable (with beat-to-beat intervals reported).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study provides some important learnings. It showed that in an older population, despite initial enthusiasm to receive a consumer-quality wrist-based fitness device, a large proportion of individuals never activated the device. However, it also found that for a majority of participants it was possible to successfully collect wearable sensor data without clinical oversight inside a home environment, and that once used, ongoing wear time was high. This suggests that a critical barrier to overcome when incorporating a wearable device into clinical research is making its initiation of use as easy as possible for the participant.",6
40,Design of a wearable device for physiological parameter monitoring in a COVID setting,"The study focuses on the realization of an accurate device for the detection of different physiological parameters. It has been realized a simple portable system containing the necessary electronics and ensuring the monitoring of the blood oxygenation, the body temperature, the air quality, the respiratory rate and the ECG. The main processing unit consists in a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to the Healthy Pi4. The latter provides the interface for the clinical pulse-oxymeter while the measures of temperature and quality air are provided using the I2C protocol. The Bluetooth module is finally used to provide the ECG and blood rate data. The collected data are elaborated using Matlab and Python. To evaluate the accuracy of the realized device some experimental tests have been conducted on different subjects, comparing subjects working in Covid area with others resting at home. In both cases the monitoring time was 4 hours. Results have shown good performances of the system, detecting accurately the differences of the parameters values between the two situations. The usability of the device was assessed by administering a questionnaire to the healthcare personnel involved in the experimentation. The outcome shows a good usability of the system as well as an acceptable dressing time.",0
41,A Wearable Textile 3D Gesture Recognition Sensor Based on Screen-Printing Technology,"Research has developed various solutions in order for computers to recognize hand gestures in the context of human machine interface (HMI). The design of a successful hand gesture recognition system must address functionality and usability. The gesture recognition market has evolved from touchpads to touchless sensors, which do not need direct contact. Their application in textiles ranges from the field of medical environments to smart home applications and the automotive industry. In this paper, a textile capacitive touchless sensor has been developed by using screen-printing technology. Two different designs were developed to obtain the best configuration, obtaining good results in both cases. Finally, as a real application, a complete solution of the sensor with wireless communications is presented to be used as an interface for a mobile phone.",0
42,Wearable Inertial Sensor System Towards Daily Human Kinematic Gait Analysis: Benchmarking Analysis to MVN BIOMECH,"This paper presents a cost- and time-effective wearable inertial sensor system, the InertialLAB. It includes gyroscopes and accelerometers for the real-time monitoring of 3D-angular velocity and 3D-acceleration of up to six lower limbs and trunk segment and sagittal joint angle up to six joints. InertialLAB followed an open architecture with a low computational load to be executed by wearable processing units up to 200 Hz for fostering kinematic gait data to third-party systems, advancing similar commercial systems. For joint angle estimation, we developed a trigonometric method based on the segments' orientation previously computed by fusion-based methods. The validation covered healthy gait patterns in varying speed and terrain (flat, ramp, and stairs) and including turns, extending the experiments approached in the literature. The benchmarking analysis to MVN BIOMECH reported that InertialLAB provides more reliable measures in stairs than in flat terrain and ramp. The joint angle time-series of InertialLAB showed good waveform similarity (>0.898) with MVN BIOMECH, resulting in high reliability and excellent validity. User-independent neural network regression models successfully minimized the drift errors observed in InertialLAB's joint angles (NRMSE < 0.092). Further, users ranked InertialLAB as good in terms of usability. InertialLAB shows promise for daily kinematic gait analysis and real-time kinematic feedback for wearable third-party systems.",7
43,"Design, deployment, and usability of a mobile system for cardiovascular health monitoring within the electronic Framingham Heart Study","Background:
        
      
      The electronic Framingham Heart Study (eFHS) is an ongoing nested study, which includes FHS study participants, examining associations between health data from mobile devices with cardiovascular risk factors and disease.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To describe application (app) design, report user characteristics, and describe usability and survey response rates.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eligible FHS participants were consented and offered a smartwatch (Apple Watch), a digital blood pressure (BP) cuff, and the eFHS smartphone app for administering surveys remotely. We assessed usability of the new app using 2 domains (functionality, aesthetics) of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and assessed survey completion rates at baseline and 3 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 196 participants were recruited using the enhanced eFHS app. Of these, 97 (49.5%) completed the MARS instrument. Average age of participants was 53 ± 9 years, 51.5% were women, and 93.8% were white. Eighty-six percent of participants completed at least 1 measure on the baseline survey, and 50% completed the 3-month assessment. Overall subjective score of the app was 4.2 ± 0.7 on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. Of those who shared their health data with others, 46% shared their BP and 7.7% shared their physical activity with a health care provider.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Participants rated the new, enhanced eFHS app positively overall. Mobile app survey completion rates were high, consistent with positive in-app ratings from participants. These mobile data collection modalities offer clinicians new opportunities to engage in conversations about health behaviors.",6
44,Usability of affordable feedback-based technologies to improve mobility and physical activity in rehabilitation: a mixed methods study,"Purpose:
        
      
      To explore physiotherapists' views on the usability of feedback-based technologies used in physical rehabilitation.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A mixed methods study which was nested within a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of affordable feedback-based technologies to improve mobility and physical activity within aged care and neurological rehabilitation. Technologies included virtual reality systems, handheld device apps and wearable devices. Physiotherapists (n = 11) who were involved in prescribing technologies during the trial rated the usability of 11 different devices using the System Usability Scale (SUS), then attended a focus group. Descriptive statistics and framework analysis were used for analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fitbit devices (mean 89.8, SD 9.3), Fysiogaming (mean 75.6, SD 15.3) and Xbox Kinect (mean 75.5, SD 11.2) rated in the acceptable range (>70) on the SUS. Three key factors on usability emerged from the focus groups: (1) Key device features relating to practicalities (ease of set up and use, reliability, safety) and therapeutic benefit (customisation, high active practice time, useful feedback) are important for usability; (2) Usability depends on the context of use; and (3) Usability can be enhanced with technical, clinical, environmental and financial support.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health service managers and clinicians should consider key device features identified, contextual factors of their service, and supports available when selecting technologies for use in clinical practice. Further collaboration between clinicians, researchers and technology developers would benefit future technology development, particularly taking into consideration the identified key device features from this study.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTechnology selection should be based on key device features relating to both practicalities and therapeutic benefit.Contextual factors and available supports should also be considered when selecting technologies.Key usability features identified in this study such as ease of set up, reliability and customisability should be considered in the design of future feedback-based technologies to optimise usability in physical rehabilitation.",3
45,Modernizing and designing evaluation frameworks for connected sensor technologies in medicine,"This manuscript is focused on the use of connected sensor technologies, including wearables and other biosensors, for a wide range of health services, such as collecting digital endpoints in clinical trials and remotely monitoring patients in clinical care. The adoption of these technologies poses five risks that currently exceed our abilities to evaluate and secure these products: (1) validation, (2) security practices, (3) data rights and governance, (4) utility and usability; and (5) economic feasibility. In this manuscript we conduct a landscape analysis of emerging evaluation frameworks developed to better manage these risks, broadly in digital health. We then propose a framework specifically for connected sensor technologies. We provide a pragmatic guide for how to put this evaluation framework into practice, taking lessons from concepts in drug and nutrition labels to craft a connected sensor technology label.",2
46,"Tracking down a solution: exploring the acceptability and value of wearable GPS devices for older persons, individuals with a disability and their support persons","Purpose:
        
      
      To explore the acceptability and value of three wearable GPS devices for older persons and individuals with a disability and safety concerns when accessing the community.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This pilot study explored six wearers' and their support persons' experience of using three different wearable GPS devices (a pendant, watch, and mini GPS phone), each for a two-week period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants identified safety as the main value of using a wearable GPS device. The acceptability and value of these devices was strongly influenced by device features, ease of use, cost, appearance, the reliability of the GPS coordinates, the wearer's health condition and the users familiarity with technology. Overall, participants indicated that they preferred the pendant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Wearable GPS devices are potentially useful in providing individuals who have safety concerns with reassurance and access to assistance as required. To ensure successful utilization, future device design and device selection should consider the user's familiarity with technology and their health condition. This study also revealed that not all wearable GPS devices provide continuous location tracking. It is therefore critical to ensure that the device's location tracking functions address the wearer's requirements and reason for using the device. Implications for Rehabilitation The acceptability and usability of wearable GPS devices is strongly influenced by the device features, ease of use, cost, appearance, the reliability of the device to provide accurate and timely GPS coordinates, as well as the health condition of the wearer and their familiarity with technology. Wearable GPS devices need to be simple to use and support and training is essential to ensure they are successfully utilized. Not all wearable GPS devices provide continuous location tracking and accuracy of location is impacted by line of sight to satellites. Therefore, care needs to be taken when choosing a suitable device, to ensure that the device's location tracking features are based on the wearer's requirements and value behind using the device.",4
47,Quantification of Free-Living Community Mobility in Healthy Older Adults Using Wearable Sensors,"Introduction: Understanding determinants of community mobility disability is critical for developing interventions aimed at preventing or delaying disability in older adults. In an effort to understand these determinants, capturing and measuring community mobility has become a key factor. The objectives of this paper are to present and illustrate the signal processing workflow and outcomes that can be extracted from an activity and community mobility measurement approach based on GPS and accelerometer sensor data and 2) to explore the construct validity of the proposed measurement approach using data collected from healthy older adults in free-living conditions. Methods: Personal, functional impairment and environmental variables were obtained by self-report questionnaires in 75 healthy community-living older adults (mean age = 66 ± 7 years old) living on the island of Montreal, QC, Canada. Participants wore, for 14 days during waking hours on the hip, a data logger incorporating a GPS receiver with a 3-axis accelerometer. Time at home ratio (THR), Trips out (TO), Destinations (D), Maximal distance of destinations (MDD), Active time ratio (ATR), Steps (S), Distance in a vehicle (DV), Time in a vehicle (TV), Distance on foot (DF), Time on foot (TF), Ellipse area (EA), and Ellipse maximum distance (EMD) were extracted from the recordings. Results: After applying quality control criteria, the original data set was reduced from 75 to 54 participants (28% attrition). Results from the remaining sample show that under free-living conditions in healthy older adults, location, activity and community mobility outcomes vary across individuals and certain personal variables (age, income, living situation, professional status, vehicle access) have potential mitigating effects on these outcomes. There was a significant (yet small) relationship (rho < 0.40) between self-reported life space and MDD, DV, EA, and EMD. Conclusion: Wearability and usability of the devices used to capture free-living community mobility impact participant compliance and the quality of the data. The construct validity of the proposed approach appears promising but requires further studies directed at populations with mobility impairments.",4
48,"Gait analysis methods: an overview of wearable and non-wearable systems, highlighting clinical applications","This article presents a review of the methods used in recognition and analysis of the human gait from three different approaches: image processing, floor sensors and sensors placed on the body.

Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40% of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5% presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5% corresponded to other wearable systems. An increasing number of research works demonstrate that various parameters such as precision, conformability, usability or transportability have indicated that the portable systems based on body sensors are promising methods for gait analysis.",0
49,Healthcare Applications of Smart Watches. A Systematic Review,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize research studies involving the use of smart watch devices for healthcare.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was chosen as the systematic review methodology. We searched PubMed, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, ACM, and IEEE Xplore. In order to include ongoing clinical trials, we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov. Two investigators evaluated the retrieved articles for inclusion. Discrepancies between investigators regarding article inclusion and extracted data were resolved through team discussion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      356 articles were screened and 24 were selected for review. The most common publication venue was in conference proceedings (13, 54%). The majority of studies were published or presented in 2015 (19, 79%). We identified two registered clinical trials underway. A large proportion of the identified studies focused on applications involving health monitoring for the elderly (6, 25%). Five studies focused on patients with Parkinson's disease and one on cardiac arrest. There were no studies which reported use of usability testing before implementation.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Most of the reviewed studies focused on the chronically ill elderly. There was a lack of detailed description of user-centered design or usability testing before implementation. Based on our review, the most commonly used platform in healthcare research was that of the Android Wear. The clinical application of smart watches as assistive devices deserves further attention.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Smart watches are unobtrusive and easy to wear. While smart watch technology supplied with biosensors has potential to be useful in a variety of healthcare applications, rigorous research with their use in clinical settings is needed.",4
50,On the way home: a BCI-FES hand therapy self-managed by sub-acute SCI participants and their caregivers: a usability study,"Background:
        
      
      Regaining hand function is the top priority for people with tetraplegia, however access to specialised therapy outwith clinics is limited. Here we present a system for hand therapy based on brain-computer interface (BCI) which uses a consumer grade electroencephalography (EEG) device combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES), and evaluate its usability among occupational therapists (OTs) and people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and their family members.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Users: Eight people with sub-acute SCI (6 M, 2F, age 55.4 ± 15.6) and their caregivers (3 M, 5F, age 45.3 ± 14.3); four OTs (4F, age 42.3 ± 9.8). User Activity: Researchers trained OTs; OTs subsequently taught caregivers to set up the system for the people with SCI to perform hand therapy. Hand therapy consisted of attempted movement (AM) of one hand to lower the power of EEG sensory-motor rhythm in the 8-12 Hz band and thereby activate FES which induced wrist flexion and extension. Technology: Consumer grade wearable EEG, multichannel FES, custom made BCI application.
    


          Location:
        
      
      Research space within hospital. Evaluation: donning times, BCI accuracy, BCI and FES parameter repeatability, questionnaires, focus groups and interviews.

      Effectiveness: The BCI accuracy was 70-90%. Efficiency: Median donning times decreased from 40.5 min for initial session to 27 min during last training session (N = 7), dropping to 14 min on the last self-managed session (N = 3). BCI and FES parameters were stable from session to session. Satisfaction: Mean satisfaction with the system among SCI users and caregivers was 3.68 ± 0.81 (max 5) as measured by QUEST questionnaire. Main facilitators for implementing BCI-FES technology were ""seeing hand moving"", ""doing something useful for the loved ones"", good level of computer literacy (people with SCI and caregivers), ""active engagement in therapy"" (OT), while main barriers were technical complexity of setup (all groups) and ""lack of clinical evidence"" (OT).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      BCI-FES has potential to be used as at home hand therapy by people with SCI or stroke, provided it is easy to use and support is provided. Transfer of knowledge of operating BCI is possible from researchers to therapists to users and caregivers.

51,Assessment of Upper Limb Movement Impairments after Stroke Using Wearable Inertial Sensing,"Precise and objective assessments of upper limb movement quality after strokes in functional task conditions are an important prerequisite to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of movement deficits and to prove the effectiveness of interventions. Herein, a wearable inertial sensing system was used to capture movements from the fingers to the trunk in 10 chronic stroke subjects when performing reach-to-grasp activities with the affected and non-affected upper limb. It was investigated whether the factors, tested arm, object weight, and target height, affect the expressions of range of motion in trunk compensation and flexion-extension of the elbow, wrist, and finger during object displacement. The relationship between these metrics and clinically measured impairment was explored. Nine subjects were included in the analysis, as one had to be excluded due to defective data. The tested arm and target height showed strong effects on all metrics, while an increased object weight showed effects on trunk compensation. High inter- and intrasubject variability was found in all metrics without clear relationships to clinical measures. Relating all metrics to each other resulted in significant negative correlations between trunk compensation and elbow flexion-extension in the affected arm. The findings support the clinical usability of sensor-based motion analysis.",3
52,Usability of Wearable Devices to Remotely Monitor Sleep Patterns Among Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      There is growing interest in using wearable devices to remotely monitor patient behaviors. However, there has been little evaluation of how often these technologies are used to monitor sleep patterns over longer term periods, particularly among more high-risk patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The goal of the research was to evaluate the proportion of time that patients with ischemic heart disease used wearable devices to monitor their sleep and identify differences in characteristics of patients with higher versus lower use.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We evaluated wearable device data from a previously conducted clinical trial testing the use of wearable devices with personalized goal-setting and financial incentives. Patients with ischemic heart disease established a sleep baseline and were then followed for 24 weeks. The proportion of days that sleep data was collected was compared over the 24 weeks and by study arm. Characteristics of patients were compared to groups with high, low, or no sleep data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The sample comprised 99 patients with ischemic heart disease, among which 79% (78/99) used the wearable device to track their sleep. During the 6-month trial, sleep data were collected on 60% (10,024/16,632) of patient-days. These rates declined over time from 77% (4292/5544) in months 1 and 2 to 58% (3188/5544) in months 3 and 4 to 46% (2544/5544) in months 5 and 6. Sleep data were collected at higher rates among the intervention group compared with control (67% vs 55%, P<.001). In the main intervention period (months 3 and 4), patients with higher rates of sleep data were on average older (P=.03), had a history of smoking (P=.007), and had higher rates of commercial health insurance (P=.03).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients with ischemic heart disease in a physical activity trial, a high proportion used wearable devices to track their sleep; however, rates declined over time. Future research should consider larger evaluations coupled with behavioral interventions.

53,Optimizing sampling rate of wrist-worn optical sensors for physiologic monitoring,"Introduction:
        
      
      Personalized medicine has exposed wearable sensors as new sources of biomedical data which are expected to accrue annual data storage costs of approximately $7.2 trillion by 2020 (>2000 exabytes). To improve the usability of wearable devices in healthcare, it is necessary to determine the minimum amount of data needed for accurate health assessment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Here, we present a generalizable optimization framework for determining the minimum necessary sampling rate for wearable sensors and apply our method to determine optimal optical blood volume pulse sampling rate. We implement t-tests, Bland-Altman analysis, and regression-based visualizations to identify optimal sampling rates of wrist-worn optical sensors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We determine the optimal sampling rate of wrist-worn optical sensors for heart rate and heart rate variability monitoring to be 21-64 Hz, depending on the metric.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Determining the optimal sampling rate allows us to compress biomedical data and reduce storage needs and financial costs. We have used optical heart rate sensors as a case study for the connection between data volumes and resource requirements to develop methodology for determining the optimal sampling rate for clinical relevance that minimizes resource utilization. This methodology is extensible to other wearable sensors.",4
54,"A Smartphone App to Reduce Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption Among Young Adults in Australian Remote Indigenous Communities: Design, Formative Evaluation and User-Testing","Background:
        
      
      The disproportionate burden of noncommunicable disease among Indigenous Australians living in remote Indigenous communities (RICs) is a complex and persistent problem. Smartphones are increasingly being used by young Indigenous adults and therefore represent a promising method to engage them in programs seeking to improve nutritional intake.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to consult RIC members to inform the content of a smartphone app that can be used to monitor and reduce sugar-sweetened beverage intake in RICs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was conducted in two phases. The formative phase involved a simulated grocery selection activity with think aloud (""think aloud shop""), a semistructured interview, a questionnaire outlining current smartphone and app use, and a paper prototyping activity. A preliminary end-user testing phase involved a think aloud prototype test and a semistructured interview regarding user satisfaction. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 18- to 35-year-old smartphone users for each phase from two RICs in the Northern Territory, Australia. Thematic analysis of transcribed audio recordings was used to identify determinants of food choice from the think aloud shop; themes related to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) from the eating behaviors interview; and usability, comprehension, and satisfaction with the app from the preliminary end-user testing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Smartphone use in RICs is currently different to that found in urban environments; in particular, extremely low use of Facebook, restricted variety of phone types, and limited Internet access. Findings regarding promoting app engagement indicate that utilizing an opt-in approach to social features such as leader boards and team challenges is essential. The inclusion of games was also shown to be important for satisfaction, as were the use of audio features, contextually embedded dissemination, and streamlined app design for comprehension in this target group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This research provides critical insights and concrete recommendations for the development of lifestyle improvement apps targeted toward disadvantaged young adults in nonurban settings, specifically RICs. It serves as a framework for future app development projects using a consultative user-centered design approach, supporting calls for the increased use of this strategy in app development.",3
55,Fully Wearable Actuated Soft Exoskeleton for Grasping Assistance in Everyday Activities,"Worldwide, over 50 million people suffer from persistent hand impairments after stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI). This results in major loss of independence and quality of life. Robotic hand exoskeletons can compensate for lost motor function and assist in grasping tasks performed in everyday activities. Several recent prototypes can partially provide this assistance. However, it remains challenging to integrate the dexterity required for daily tasks in a safe and user-friendly design that is acceptable for daily use in subjects with neuromotor hand impairments. We present the design of RELab tenoexo; a fully wearable assistive soft hand exoskeleton for daily activities. We present sleek mechanisms for a hand module that generates the four most frequently used grasp types, employing a remote actuation system that reduces weight on the hand. For optimal assistance and highest adaptability, we present various design and control options to customize the modular device, along with an automated tailoring algorithm that allows automatically generated hand modules for individual users. Mechanical evaluation shows that RELab tenoexo covers the range of motion and the fingertip forces required to assist users in up to 80% of all grasping activities. In user tests, we find that the low weight, unintrusive size, high wearing comfort, and appealing appearance are beneficial for user acceptance and usability in daily life. Finally, we demonstrate that RELab tenoexo leads to an immediate improvement of the functional grasping ability in a subject with SCI.",0
56,Signal quality and patient experience with wearable devices for epilepsy management,"Noninvasive wearable devices have great potential to aid the management of epilepsy, but these devices must have robust signal quality, and patients must be willing to wear them for long periods of time. Automated machine learning classification of wearable biosensor signals requires quantitative measures of signal quality to automatically reject poor-quality or corrupt data segments. In this study, commercially available wearable sensors were placed on patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital or in-home electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and healthy volunteers. Empatica E4 and Biovotion Everion were used to record accelerometry (ACC), photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). Byteflies Sensor Dots were used to record ACC and PPG, the Activinsights GENEActiv watch to record ACC, and Epitel Epilog to record EEG data. PPG and EDA signals were recorded for multiple days, then epochs of high-quality, marginal-quality, or poor-quality data were visually identified by reviewers, and reviewer annotations were compared to automated signal quality measures. For ACC, the ratio of spectral power from 0.8 to 5 Hz to broadband power was used to separate good-quality signals from noise. For EDA, the rate of amplitude change and prevalence of sharp peaks significantly differentiated between good-quality data and noise. Spectral entropy was used to assess PPG and showed significant differences between good-, marginal-, and poor-quality signals. EEG data were evaluated using methods to identify a spectral noise cutoff frequency. Patients were asked to rate the usability and comfort of each device in several categories. Patients showed a significant preference for the wrist-worn devices, and the Empatica E4 device was preferred most often. Current wearable devices can provide high-quality data and are acceptable for routine use, but continued development is needed to improve data quality, consistency, and management, as well as acceptability to patients.",1
57,Usability Study of a Wireless Monitoring System among Alzheimer's Disease Elderly Population,"Healthcare technologies are slowly entering into our daily lives, replacing old devices and techniques with newer intelligent ones. Although they are meant to help people, the reaction and willingness to use such new devices by the people can be unexpected, especially among the elderly. We conducted a usability study of a fall monitoring system in a long-term nursing home. The subjects were the elderly with advanced Alzheimer's disease. The study presented here highlights some of the challenges faced in the use of wearable devices and the lessons learned. The results gave us useful insights, leading to ergonomics and aesthetics modifications to our wearable systems that significantly improved their usability and acceptance. New evaluating metrics were designed for the performance evaluation of usability and acceptability.",2
58,HapPro: A Wearable Haptic Device for Proprioceptive Feedback,"Objective:
        
      
      Myoelectric hand prostheses have reached a considerable technological level and gained an increasing attention in assistive robotics. However, their abandonment rate remains high, with unintuitive control and lack of sensory feedback being major causes. Among the different types of sensory information, proprioception, e.g., information on hand aperture, is crucial to successfully perform everyday actions. Despite the many attempts in literature to restore and convey this type of feedback, much remains to be done to close the action-perception loop in prosthetic devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      With this as motivation, in this paper we introduce HapPro, a wearable, noninvasive haptic device that can convey proprioceptive information for a prosthetic hand. The device was used with an under-actuated, simple to control anthropomorphic robotic hand, providing information about hand aperture by mapping it to the position of a wheel that can run on the user's forearm. Tests with 43 able bodied subjects and one amputee subject were conducted in order to quantify the effectiveness of HapPro as a feedback device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      HapPro provided a good level of accuracy for item discrimination. Participants also reported the device to be intuitive and effective in conveying proprioceptive cues. Similar results were obtained in the proof-of-concept experiment with an amputee subject.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Results show that HapPro is able to convey information on the opening of a prosthetic hand in a noninvasive way.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      Using this device for proprioceptive feedback could improve usability of myoelectric prostheses, potentially reducing abandonment and increasing quality of life for their users.",3
59,A Smart Wearable Sensor System for Counter-Fighting Overweight in Teenagers,"PEGASO is a FP7-funded project whose goal is to develop an ICT and mobile-based platform together with an appropriate strategy to tackle the diffusion of obesity and other lifestyle-related illnesses among teenagers. Indeed, the design of an engaging strategy, leveraging a complementary set of technologies, is the approach proposed by the project to promote the adoption of healthy habits such as active lifestyle and balanced nutrition and to effectively counter-fight the emergence of overweight and obesity in the younger population. A technological key element of such a strategy sees the adoption of wearable sensors to monitor teenagers' activities, which is at the basis of developing awareness about the current lifestyle. This paper describes the experience carried out in the framework of the PEGASO project in developing and evaluating wearable monitoring systems addressed to adolescents. The paper describes the methodological approach based on the co-designing of such a wearable system and the main results that, in the first phase, involved a total of 407 adolescents across Europe in a series of focus groups conducted in three countries for the requirements definition phase. Moreover, it describes an evaluation process of signal reliability during the usage of the wearable system. The main results described here are: (a) a prototype of the standardized experimental protocol that has been developed and applied to test signal reliability in smart garments; (b) the requirements definition methodology through a co-design activity and approach to address user requirements and preferences and not only technological specifications. Such co-design approach is able to support a higher system acceptance and usability together with a sustained adoption of the solution with respect to the traditional technology push system development strategy.",0
60,Evolution of SmartBEAT for Heart Failure Telemonitoring,"The prevalence of Heart Failure is growing exponentially in the last decades, particularly amongst older adults. Heart Failure is a chronic cardiovascular disease that demands self-care management and substantial healthcare resources. For that reason, it is highly associated with hospital readmissions and mortality. Due to increased hospitalization costs, excessive waiting times and lack of specialized healthcare professionals to follow-up this growing population, telemedicine and telemonitoring technologies have become the best solutions to support health providers in the disease management tasks. Telemonitoring technologies offer better and more comfortable care because the elderly do not have to leave the comfort of their home to interact with the doctors, giving and receiving daily feedbacks trough these new applications, wearables, and health care platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive review covering the current progress of research in telemedicine and telemonitoring and their applications to Heart Failure Management services. It presents SmartBEAT, which demonstrated during a pilot phase, a user adherence of 97% for three months. Furthermore, SmartBEAT plus, an improved solution, is described, and the system usability a technology acceptance will be evaluated through a pilot with 40 Heart Failure Patients, involving nurses and cardiologists.",2
61,A Report on Smoking Detection and Quitting Technologies,"Mobile health technologies are being developed for personal lifestyle and medical healthcare support, of which a growing number are designed to assist smokers to quit. The potential impact of these technologies in the fight against smoking addiction and on improving quitting rates must be systematically evaluated. The aim of this report is to identify and appraise the most promising smoking detection and quitting technologies (e.g., smartphone apps, wearable devices) supporting smoking reduction or quitting programs. We searched PubMed and Scopus databases (2008-2019) for studies on mobile health technologies developed to assist smokers to quit using a combination of Medical Subject Headings topics and free text terms. A Google search was also performed to retrieve the most relevant smartphone apps for quitting smoking, considering the average user's rating and the ranking computed by the search engine algorithms. All included studies were evaluated using consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, such as applied methodologies and the performed evaluation protocol. Main outcome measures were usability and effectiveness of smoking detection and quitting technologies supporting smoking reduction or quitting programs. Our search identified 32 smoking detection and quitting technologies (12 smoking detection systems and 20 smoking quitting smartphone apps). Most of the existing apps for quitting smoking require the users to register every smoking event. Moreover, only a restricted group of them have been scientifically evaluated. The works supported by documented experimental evaluation show very high detection scores, however the experimental protocols usually lack in variability (e.g., only right-hand patients, not natural sequence of gestures) and have been conducted with limited numbers of patients as well as under constrained settings quite far from real-life use scenarios. Several recent scientific works show very promising results but, at the same time, present obstacles for the application on real-life daily scenarios.",1
62,Personalizing Activity Recognition Models Through Quantifying Different Types of Uncertainty Using Wearable Sensors,"Recognizing activities of daily living (ADL) provides vital contextual information that enhances the effectiveness of various mobile health and wellness applications. Development of wearable motion sensors along with machine learning algorithms offer a great opportunity for ADL recognition. However, the performance of the ADL recognition systems may significantly degrade when they are used by a new user due to inter-subject variability. This issue limits the usability of these systems. In this paper, we propose a deep learning assisted personalization framework for ADL recognition with the aim to maximize the personalization performance while minimizing solicitation of inputs or labels from the user to reduce user's burden. The proposed framework consists of unsupervised retraining of automatic feature extraction layers and supervised fine-tuning of classification layers through a novel active learning model based on a given model's uncertainty. We design a Bayesian deep convolutional neural network with stochastic latent variables that allows us to estimate both aleatoric (data-dependent) and epistemic (model-dependent) uncertainties in recognition task. In this study, for the first time, we show how distinguishing between the two aforementioned sources of uncertainty leads to more effective active learning. The experimental results show that our proposed method improves the accuracy of ADL recognition on a new user by 25% on average compared to the case of using a model for a new user with no personalization with an average final accuracy of 89.2%. Moreover, our method achieves higher personalization accuracy while significantly reducing user's burden in terms of soliciting inputs and labels compared to other methods.",1
63,Current reporting of usability and impact of mHealth interventions for substance use disorder: A systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      Connected interventions use data collected through mobile/wearable devices to trigger real-time interventions and have great potential to improve treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). This review aims to describe the current landscape, effectiveness and usability of connected interventions for SUD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted to identify articles evaluating connected health interventions for SUD in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, IEEE, and Scopus) were searched over a five-year period. Included articles described a connected health intervention targeting SUD and provided outcomes data. Data were extracted using a standardized reporting tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1676 unique articles were identified during the initial search, with 32 articles included in the final analysis. Seven articles of the 32 were derived from two large studies. The most commonly studied SUD was alcohol use disorder. Sixteen articles reported at least one statistically significant result with respect to reduced craving and/or substance use. The majority of articles used ecological momentary assessment to trigger interventions, while four used biologic/physiologic data. Two articles used a wearable device. Common intervention types included craving management, coping assistance, and tailored feedback. Twenty-three articles measured usability factors, and acceptability was generally reported as high.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Identified themes included a focus on AUD, use of smart phones, use of EMA for intervention delivery, positive effects on SUD related outcomes, and overall high acceptability. Wearables that directly monitor biologic data and predictive analytics using integrated data streams represent understudied opportunities for new research.",4

65,The Challenging Path to Developing a Mobile Health Device for Epilepsy: The Current Landscape and Where We Go From Here,"Seizure detection, and more recently seizure forecasting, represent important avenues of clinical development in epilepsy, promoted by progress in wearable devices and mobile health (mHealth), which might help optimizing seizure control and prevention of seizure-related mortality and morbidity in persons with epilepsy. Yet, very long-term continuous monitoring of seizure-sensitive biosignals in the ambulatory setting presents a number of challenges. We herein provide an overview of these challenges and current technological landscape of mHealth devices for seizure detection. Specifically, we display, which types of sensor modalities and analytical methods are available, and give insight into current clinical practice guidelines, main outcomes of clinical validation studies, and discuss how to evaluate device performance at point-of-care facilities. We then address pitfalls which may arise in patient compliance and the need to design solutions adapted to user experience.",2
66,Usability of Three-dimensional Augmented Visual Cues Delivered by Smart Glasses on (Freezing of) Gait in Parkinson's Disease,"External cueing is a potentially effective strategy to reduce freezing of gait (FOG) in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Case reports suggest that three-dimensional (3D) cues might be more effective in reducing FOG than two-dimensional cues. We investigate the usability of 3D augmented reality visual cues delivered by smart glasses in comparison to conventional 3D transverse bars on the floor and auditory cueing via a metronome in reducing FOG and improving gait parameters. In laboratory experiments, 25 persons with PD and FOG performed walking tasks while wearing custom-made smart glasses under five conditions, at the end-of-dose. For two conditions, augmented visual cues (bars/staircase) were displayed via the smart glasses. The control conditions involved conventional 3D transverse bars on the floor, auditory cueing via a metronome, and no cueing. The number of FOG episodes and percentage of time spent on FOG were rated from video recordings. The stride length and its variability, cycle time and its variability, cadence, and speed were calculated from motion data collected with a motion capture suit equipped with 17 inertial measurement units. A total of 300 FOG episodes occurred in 19 out of 25 participants. There were no statistically significant differences in number of FOG episodes and percentage of time spent on FOG across the five conditions. The conventional bars increased stride length, cycle time, and stride length variability, while decreasing cadence and speed. No effects for the other conditions were found. Participants preferred the metronome most, and the augmented staircase least. They suggested to improve the comfort, esthetics, usability, field of view, and stability of the smart glasses on the head and to reduce their weight and size. In their current form, augmented visual cues delivered by smart glasses are not beneficial for persons with PD and FOG. This could be attributable to distraction, blockage of visual feedback, insufficient familiarization with the smart glasses, or display of the visual cues in the central rather than peripheral visual field. Future smart glasses are required to be more lightweight, comfortable, and user friendly to avoid distraction and blockage of sensory feedback, thus increasing usability.",6
67,Lumbatex: A Wearable Monitoring System Based on Inertial Sensors to Measure and Control the Lumbar Spine Motion,"Measuring the curvature of the lumbar spine is an important challenge in disciplines related to physical therapy, rehabilitation, and sports medicine seeking to solve the incidence of the low back pain and other spinal disorders in the population. In clinical practice, most of the methods used are manual or depend on the trained eye of the specialist who is measuring. We have developed Lumbatex: an integrated system based on inertial sensors integrated into a wearable textile device. This device is connected via Bluetooth to software, which interprets data from the sensors and provides real-time biofeedback to users in a graphical way and also a quantitative measure of the curvature and spinal motion. The system is tested in two ways: first, checking the accuracy detecting changes in curvatures; second, evaluating the usability and comfort from the user standpoint. The accuracy is checked through a static method getting curvature values from the device placed on curved platforms and a dynamic validation with volunteers performing different exercises. The results obtained showed a high accuracy measuring changes in curvature with an error lower than 1° in the static test and good usability and comfort according to the opinion of the volunteers.",3
68,Personalized Analytics and a Wearable Biosensor Platform for Early Detection of COVID-19 Decompensation (DeCODe): Protocol for the Development of the COVID-19 Decompensation Index,"Background:
        
      
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

69,Wearable sensors to improve detection of patient deterioration,"Introduction:
        
      
      Monitoring a patient's vital signs forms a basic component of care, enabling the identification of deteriorating patients and increasing the likelihood of improving patient outcomes. Several paper-based track and trigger warning scores have been developed to allow clinical evaluation of a patient and guidance on escalation protocols and frequency of monitoring. However, evidence suggests that patient deterioration on hospital wards is still missed, and that patients are still falling through the safety net. Wearable sensor technology is currently undergoing huge growth, and the development of new light-weight wireless wearable sensors has enabled multiple vital signs monitoring of ward patients continuously and in real time.
    


          Areas covered:
        
      
      In this paper, we aim to closely examine the benefits of wearable monitoring applications that measure multiple vital signs; in the context of improving healthcare and delivery. A review of the literature was performed.
    


          Expert commentary:
        
      
      Findings suggest that several sensor designs are available with the potential to improve patient safety for both hospital patients and those at home. Larger clinical trials are required to ensure both diagnostic accuracy and usability.",2
70,SenseCam: A new tool for memory rehabilitation?,"The emergence of life-logging technologies has led neuropsychologist to focus on understanding how this new technology could help patients with memory disorders. Despite the growing number of studies using life-logging technologies, a theoretical framework supporting its effectiveness is lacking. This review focuses on the use of life-logging in the context of memory rehabilitation, particularly the use of SenseCam, a wearable camera allowing passive image capture. In our opinion, reviewing SenseCam images can be effective for memory rehabilitation only if it provides more than an assessment of prior occurrence in ways that reinstates previous thoughts, feelings and sensory information, thus stimulating recollection. Considering the fact that, in memory impairment, self-initiated processes are impaired, we propose that the environmental support hypothesis can explain the value of SenseCam for memory retrieval. Twenty-five research studies were selected for this review and despite the general acceptance of the value of SenseCam as a memory technique, only a small number of studies focused on recollection. We discuss the usability of this tool to improve episodic memory and in particular, recollection.",4
71,Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the 'HEYMAN' healthy lifestyle program for young men: a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      In young men, unhealthy lifestyle behaviours can be detrimental to their physical and/or mental health and set them on a negative health trajectory into adulthood. Despite this, there is a lack of evidence to guide development of effective health behaviour change interventions for young men. This study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the 'HEYMAN' (Harnessing Ehealth to enhance Young men's Mental health, Activity and Nutrition) healthy lifestyle program for young men.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A pilot RCT with 50 young men aged 18-25 years randomised to the HEYMAN intervention (n = 26) or waitlist control (n = 24). HEYMAN was a 3-month intervention, targeted for young men to improve eating habits, activity levels and well-being. Intervention development was informed by a participatory research model (PRECEDE-PROCEED). Intervention components included eHealth support (website, wearable device, Facebook support group), face-to-face sessions (group and individual), a personalised food and nutrient report, home-based resistance training equipment and a portion control tool. Outcomes included: feasibility of research procedures (recruitment, randomisation, data collection and retention) and of intervention components. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the treatment effect at 3-months for the primary outcomes: pedometer steps/day, diet quality, well-being and several secondary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A 7-week recruitment period was required to enrol 50 young men. A retention rate of 94% was achieved at 3-months post-intervention. Retained intervention participants (n = 24) demonstrated reasonable usage levels for most program components and also reported reasonable levels of program component acceptability for attractiveness, comprehension, usability, support, satisfaction and ability to persuade, with scores ranging from 3.0 to 4.6 (maximum 5). No significant intervention effects were observed for the primary outcomes of steps/day (1012.7, 95% CI = -506.2, 2531.6, p = 0.191, d = 0.36), diet quality score (3.6, 95% CI = -0.4, 7.6, p = 0.081, d = 0.48) or total well-being score (0.4, 95% CI = -1.6, 2.5, p = 0.683, d = 0.11). Significant intervention effects were found for daily vegetable servings, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, MVPA, weight, BMI, fat mass, waist circumference and cholesterol (all p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The HEYMAN program demonstrated feasibility in assisting young men to make some positive lifestyle changes. This provides support for the conduct of a larger, fully-powered RCT, but with minor amendments to research procedures and intervention components required.

72,Satisfaction and Usability of an Information and Communications Technology-Based System by Clinically Healthy Patients With COVID-19 and Medical Professionals: Cross-sectional Survey and Focus Group Interview Study,"Background:
        
      
      Digital health care is an important strategy in the war against COVID-19. South Korea introduced living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) to control regional outbreaks and care for patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) introduced information and communications technology (ICT)-based solutions to manage clinically healthy patients with COVID-19.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to investigate satisfaction and usability by patients and health professionals in the optimal use of a mobile app and wearable device that SNUH introduced to the LTSC for clinically healthy patients with COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Online surveys and focus group interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Regarding usability testing of the wearable device, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.45 (SD 0.57) points out of 5. Regarding usability of the mobile app, perceived usefulness had the highest mean score of 4.62 (SD 0.48) points out of 5. Regarding satisfaction items for the mobile app among medical professionals, the ""self-reporting"" item had the highest mean score of 4.42 (SD 0.58) points out of 5. In focus group interviews of health care professionals, hospital information system interfacing was the most important functional requirement for ICT-based COVID-19 telemedicine.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Improvement of patient safety and reduction of the burden on medical staff were the expected positive outcomes. Stability and reliability of the device, patient education, accountability, and reimbursement issues should be considered as part of the development of remote patient monitoring. In responding to a novel contagious disease, telemedicine and a wearable device were shown to be useful during a global crisis.",2
73,Development of a Wearable Cardiac Monitoring System for Behavioral Neurocardiac Training: A Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Elevated blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for death globally. Behavioral neurocardiac training (BNT) is a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management that is intended to exercise the autonomic reflexes, improve stress recovery, and lower blood pressure. BNT involves cognitive-behavioral therapy with a paced breathing technique and heart rate variability biofeedback. BNT is limited to in-clinic delivery and faces an accessibility barrier because of the need for clinical oversight and the use of complex monitoring tools.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this project was to design, develop, and evaluate a wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensor system for the delivery of BNT in a home setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The wearable sensor system, Beat, consists of an ECG sensor and a mobile app. It was developed iteratively using the principles of test-driven Agile development and user-centered design. A usability study was conducted at Toronto General Hospital to evaluate feasibility and user experience and identify areas of improvement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Beat sensor was designed as a modular patch to be worn on the user's chest and uses standard ECG electrodes. It streams a single-lead ECG wirelessly to a mobile phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. The use of small, low-power electronics, a low device profile, and a tapered enclosure allowed for a device that can be unobtrusively worn under clothing. The sensor was designed to operate with a mobile app that guides users through the BNT exercises to train them to a slow-paced breathing technique for stress recovery. The BNT app uses the ECG captured by the sensor to provide heart rate variability biofeedback in the form of a real-time heart rate waveform to complement and reinforce the impact of the training. Usability testing (n=6) indicated that the overall response to the design and user experience of the system was perceived positively. All participants indicated that the system had a positive effect on stress management and that they would use it at home. Areas of improvement were identified, which focused primarily on the delivery of training and education on BNT through the app.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The outcome of this project was a wearable sensor system to deliver BNT at home. The system has the potential to offer a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management at home and reduce current accessibility barriers.",5
74,Development of a Wearable Instrumented Vest for Posture Monitoring and System Usability Verification Based on the Technology Acceptance Model,"Body posture and activity are important indices for assessing health and quality of life, especially for elderly people. Therefore, an easily wearable device or instrumented garment would be valuable for monitoring elderly people's postures and activities to facilitate healthy aging. In particular, such devices should be accepted by elderly people so that they are willing to wear it all the time. This paper presents the design and development of a novel, textile-based, intelligent wearable vest for real-time posture monitoring and emergency warnings. The vest provides a highly portable and low-cost solution that can be used both indoors and outdoors in order to provide long-term care at home, including health promotion, healthy aging assessments, and health abnormality alerts. The usability of the system was verified using a technology acceptance model-based study of 50 elderly people. The results indicated that although elderly people are anxious about some newly developed wearable technologies, they look forward to wearing this instrumented posture-monitoring vest in the future.",0
75,An Intelligent Individualized Cardiovascular App for Risk Elimination (iCARE) for Individuals With Coronary Heart Disease: Development and Usability Testing Analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Death and disability from coronary heart disease (CHD) can be largely reduced by improving risk factor management. However, adhering to evidence-based recommendations is challenging and requires interventions at the level of the patient, provider, and health system.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to develop an Intelligent Individualized Cardiovascular App for Risk Elimination (iCARE) to facilitate adherence to health behaviors and preventive medications, and to test the usability of iCARE.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed iCARE based on a user-centered design approach, which included 4 phases: (1) function design, (2) iterative design, (3) expert inspections and walkthroughs of the prototypes, and (4) usability testing with end users. The usability testing of iCARE included 2 stages: stage I, which included a task analysis and a usability evaluation (January to March 2019) of the iCARE patient app using the modified Health Information Technology Usability Survey (Health-ITUES); and stage II (June 2020), which used the Health-ITUES among end users who used the app for 6 months. The end users were individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of CHD from 2 university-affiliated hospitals in Beijing, China.
    


          Results:
        
      
      iCARE consists of a patient app, a care provider app, and a cloud platform. It has a set of algorithms that trigger tailored feedback and can send individualized interventions based on data from initial assessment and health monitoring via manual entry or wearable devices. For stage I usability testing, 88 hospitalized patients (72% [63/88] male; mean age 60 [SD 9.9] years) with CHD were included in the study. The mean score of the usability testing was 90.1 (interquartile range 83.3-99.0). Among enrolled participants, 90% (79/88) were satisfied with iCARE; 94% (83/88) and 82% (72/88) reported that iCARE was useful and easy to use, respectively. For stage II usability testing, 61 individuals with CHD (85% [52/61] male; mean age 53 [SD 8.2] years) who were from an intervention arm and used iCARE for at least six months were included. The mean total score on usability testing based on the questionnaire was 89.0 (interquartile distance: 77.0-99.5). Among enrolled participants, 89% (54/61) were satisfied with the use of iCARE, 93% (57/61) perceived it as useful, and 70% (43/61) as easy to use.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study developed an intelligent, individualized, evidence-based, and theory-driven app (iCARE) to improve patients' adherence to health behaviors and medication management. iCARE was identified to be highly acceptable, useful, and easy to use among individuals with a diagnosis of CHD.

76,Translational Applications of Wearable Sensors in Education: Implementation and Efficacy,"Background:
        
      
      Adding new approaches to teaching curriculums can be both expensive and complex to learn. The aim of this research was to gain insight into students' literacy and confidence in learning sports science with new wearable technologies, specifically a novel program known as STEMfit.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A three-phase design was carried out, with 36 students participating and exposed to wearable devices and associated software. This was to determine whether the technology hardware (phase one) and associated software (phase two) were used in a positive way that demonstrated user confidence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Hardware included choosing a scalable wearable device that worked in conjunction with familiar and readily available software (Microsoft Excel) that extracted data through VBA coding. This allowed for students to experience and provide survey feedback on the usability and confidence gained when interacting with the STEMfit program. Outcomes indicated strong acceptance of the program, with high levels of motivation, resulting in a positive uptake of wearable technology as a teaching tool by students. The initial finding of this study offers an opportunity to further test the STEMfit program on other student cohorts as well as testing the scalability of the system into other year groups at the university level.",4
77,Upper limb soft robotic wearable devices: a systematic review,"Introduction:
        
      
      Soft robotic wearable devices, referred to as exosuits, can be a valid alternative to rigid exoskeletons when it comes to daily upper limb support. Indeed, their inherent flexibility improves comfort, usability, and portability while not constraining the user's natural degrees of freedom. This review is meant to guide the reader in understanding the current approaches across all design and production steps that might be exploited when developing an upper limb robotic exosuit.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The literature research regarding such devices was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The investigated features are the intended scenario, type of actuation, supported degrees of freedom, low-level control, high-level control with a focus on intention detection, technology readiness level, and type of experiments conducted to evaluate the device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 105 articles were collected, describing 69 different devices. Devices were grouped according to their actuation type. More than 80% of devices are meant either for rehabilitation, assistance, or both. The most exploited actuation types are pneumatic (52%) and DC motors with cable transmission (29%). Most devices actuate 1 (56%) or 2 (28%) degrees of freedom, and the most targeted joints are the elbow and the shoulder. Intention detection strategies are implemented in 33% of the suits and include the use of switches and buttons, IMUs, stretch and bending sensors, EMG and EEG measurements. Most devices (75%) score a technology readiness level of 4 or 5.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although few devices can be considered ready to reach the market, exosuits show very high potential for the assistance of daily activities. Clinical trials exploiting shared evaluation metrics are needed to assess the effectiveness of upper limb exosuits on target users.",0
78,Highly wearable galvanic skin response sensor using flexible and conductive polymer foam,"Owing to advancements in daily physiological monitoring technology, diverse healthcare applications have emerged recently. The monitoring of skin conductance responses has extensive feasibility to support healthcare applications such as detecting emotion changes. In this study, we proposed a highly wearable and reliable galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor that measures the signals from the back of the user. To enhance its wearability and usability, we employed flexible conductive foam as the sensing material and designed it to be easily attachable to (and detachable from) a wide variety of clothes. We evaluated the sensing reliability of the proposed sensor by comparing its signal with a reference GSR. The average correlation between the two signals was 0.768; this is sufficiently high to validate the feasibility of the proposed sensor for reliable GSR sensing on the back.",0
79,Kinect and wearable inertial sensors for motor rehabilitation programs at home: state of the art and an experimental comparison,"Background:
        
      
      Emerging sensing and communication technologies are contributing to the development of many motor rehabilitation programs outside the standard healthcare facilities. Nowadays, motor rehabilitation exercises can be easily performed and monitored even at home by a variety of motion-tracking systems. These are cheap, reliable, easy-to-use, and allow also remote configuration and control of the rehabilitation programs. The two most promising technologies for home-based motor rehabilitation programs are inertial wearable sensors and video-based motion capture systems.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this paper, after a thorough review of the relevant literature, an original experimental analysis is reported for two corresponding commercially available solutions, a wearable inertial measurement unit and the Kinect, respectively. For the former, a number of different algorithms for rigid body pose estimation from sensor data were also tested. Both systems were compared with the measurements obtained with state-of-the-art marker-based stereophotogrammetric motion analysis, taken as a gold-standard, and also evaluated outside the lab in a home environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results in the laboratory setting showed similarly good performance for the elementary large motion exercises, with both systems having errors in the 3-8 degree range. Usability and other possible limitations were also assessed during utilization at home, which revealed additional advantages and drawbacks for the two systems.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The two evaluated systems use different technology and algorithms, but have similar performance in terms of human motion tracking. Therefore, both can be adopted for monitoring home-based rehabilitation programs, taking adequate precautions however for operation, user instructions and interpretation of the results.",0
80,Development of a Patient Preference Survey for Wearable Kidney Replacement Therapy Devices,"Background:
        
      
      Recent innovations have the potential to disrupt the current paradigm for kidney failure treatment. The US Food and Drug Administration is committed to incorporating valid scientific evidence about how patients weigh the benefits and risks of new devices into their decision making, but to date, premarket submission of patient preference information (PPI) has been limited for kidney devices. With input from stakeholders, we developed a survey intended to yield valid PPI, capturing how patients trade off the potential benefits and risks of wearable dialysis devices and in-center hemodialysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted concept elicitation interviews with individuals receiving dialysis to inform instrument content. After instrument drafting, we conducted two rounds of pretest interviews to evaluate survey face validity, comprehensibility, and perceived relevance. We pilot tested the survey with in-center hemodialysis patients to assess comprehensibility and usability further. Throughout, we used participant input to guide survey refinements.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-six individuals receiving in-center or home dialysis participated in concept elicitation (N=20) and pretest (N=16) interviews. Participants identified reduced fatigue, lower treatment burden, and enhanced freedom as important benefits of a wearable device, and many expressed concerns about risks related to device disconnection-specifically bleeding and infection. We drafted a survey that included descriptions of the risks of serious bleeding and serious infection and an assessment of respondent willingness to wait for a safer device. Input from pretest interviewees led to various instrument modifications, including treatment descriptions, item wording, and risk-level explanations. Pilot testing of the updated survey among 24 in-center hemodialysis patients demonstrated acceptable survey comprehensibility and usability, although 50% of patients required some assistance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The final survey is a 54-item web-based instrument that will yield estimates of the maximal acceptable risk for the described wearable device and willingness to wait for wearable devices with lower risk.",4
81,Prospective Study of a Multimodal Convulsive Seizure Detection Wearable System on Pediatric and Adult Patients in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit,"Background: Using machine learning to combine wrist accelerometer (ACM) and electrodermal activity (EDA) has been shown effective to detect primarily and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, here termed as convulsive seizures (CS). A prospective study was conducted for the FDA clearance of an ACM and EDA-based CS-detection device based on a predefined machine learning algorithm. Here we present its performance on pediatric and adult patients in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs). Methods: Patients diagnosed with epilepsy participated in a prospective multi-center clinical study. Three board-certified neurologists independently labeled CS from video-EEG. The Detection Algorithm was evaluated in terms of Sensitivity and false alarm rate per 24 h-worn (FAR) on all the data and on only periods of rest. Performance were analyzed also applying the Detection Algorithm offline, with a less sensitive but more specific parameters configuration (""Active mode""). Results: Data from 152 patients (429 days) were used for performance evaluation (85 pediatric aged 6-20 years, and 67 adult aged 21-63 years). Thirty-six patients (18 pediatric) experienced a total of 66 CS (35 pediatric). The Sensitivity (corrected for clustered data) was 0.92, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [0.85-1.00] for the pediatric population, not significantly different (p > 0.05) from the adult population's Sensitivity (0.94, CI: [0.89-1.00]). The FAR on the pediatric population was 1.26 (CI: [0.87-1.73]), higher (p < 0.001) than in the adult population (0.57, CI: [0.36-0.81]). Using the Active mode, the FAR decreased by 68% while reducing Sensitivity to 0.95 across the population. During rest periods, the FAR's were 0 for all patients, lower than during activity periods (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Performance complies with FDA's requirements of a lower bound of CI for Sensitivity higher than 0.7 and of a FAR lower than 2, for both age groups. The pediatric FAR was higher than the adult FAR, likely due to higher pediatric activity. The high Sensitivity and precision (having no false alarms) during sleep might help mitigate SUDEP risk by summoning caregiver intervention. The Active mode may be advantageous for some patients, reducing the impact of the FAR on daily life. Future work will examine the performance and usability outside of EMUs.",1
82,A wearable soft-robotic glove enables hand support in ADL and rehabilitation: A feasibility study on the assistive functionality,"Background:
        
      
      Elderly people frequently experience a decline in hand function, due to ageing or diseases. This leads to decreased independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Assistive technology may enhance independence.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objective of this paper was to explore user acceptance of an affordable wearable soft-robotic glove (ironHand (iH) system), that supports grip and hand opening in ADL. In addition, functional performance with the iH system was explored.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For this study 28 elderly people used the iH system across two sessions. During these sessions, participants performed six functional tasks with and without the iH system. Outcome measures were System Usability Scale (SUS), Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) and performance time of the functional tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      User acceptance scored highly, with a mean SUS score of at least 63.4 (SD = 19.0) and a mean IMI score of 5.1 points (SD = 0.97 points). Functional task performance improved across repetitions both with and without the glove (p ≤ 0.017), but all functional tasks were performed faster without the glove (p ≤ 0.032).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Participants perceived the iH system as useful, pleasant and meaningful. The learning curve in functional performance time (improvements across repetitions) is promising, since it suggests there is room for improved performance when a longer acquaintance period is applied.",5
83,Recognizing Solo Jazz Dance Moves Using a Single Leg-Attached Inertial Wearable Device,"We present here a method for recognising dance moves in sequences using 3D accelerometer and gyroscope signals, acquired by a single wearable device, attached to the dancer's leg. The recognition entails dance tempo estimation, temporal scaling, a wearable device orientation-invariant coordinate system transformation, and, finally, sliding correlation-based template matching. The recognition is independent of the orientation of the wearable device and the tempo of dancing, which promotes the usability of the method in a wide range of everyday application scenarios. For experimental validation, we considered the versatile repertoire of solo jazz dance moves. We created a database of 15 authentic solo jazz template moves using the performances of a professional dancer dancing at 120 bpm. We analysed 36 new dance sequences, performed by the professional and five recreational dancers, following six dance tempos, ranging from 120 bpm to 220 bpm with 20 bpm increment steps. The recognition F1 scores, obtained cumulatively for all moves for different tempos, ranged from 0.87 to 0.98. The results indicate that the presented method can be used to recognise repeated dance moves and to assess the dancer's consistency in performance. In addition, the results confirm the potential of using the presented method to recognise imitated dance moves, supporting the learning process.",7
84,BeatWalk: Personalized Music-Based Gait Rehabilitation in Parkinson's Disease,"Taking regular walks when living with Parkinson's disease (PD) has beneficial effects on movement and quality of life. Yet, patients usually show reduced physical activity compared to healthy older adults. Using auditory stimulation such as music can facilitate walking but patients vary significantly in their response. An individualized approach adapting musical tempo to patients' gait cadence, and capitalizing on these individual differences, is likely to provide a rewarding experience, increasing motivation for walk-in PD. We aim to evaluate the observance, safety, tolerance, usability, and enjoyment of a new smartphone application. It was coupled with wearable sensors (BeatWalk) and delivered individualized musical stimulation for gait auto-rehabilitation at home. Forty-five patients with PD underwent a 1-month, outdoor, uncontrolled gait rehabilitation program, using the BeatWalk application (30 min/day, 5 days/week). The music tempo was being aligned in real-time to patients' gait cadence in a way that could foster an increase up to +10% of their spontaneous cadence. Open-label evaluation was based on BeatWalk use measures, questionnaires, and a six-minute walk test. Patients used the application 78.8% (±28.2) of the prescribed duration and enjoyed it throughout the program. The application was considered ""easy to use"" by 75% of the patients. Pain, fatigue, and falls did not increase. Fear of falling decreased and quality of life improved. After the program, patients improved their gait parameters in the six-minute walk test without musical stimulation. BeatWalk is an easy to use, safe, and enjoyable musical application for individualized gait rehabilitation in PD. It increases ""walk for exercise"" duration thanks to high observance.

85,Development of a Just-in-Time Adaptive mHealth Intervention for Insomnia: Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Healthy sleep is a fundamental component of physical and brain health. Insomnia, however, is a prevalent sleep disorder that compromises functioning, productivity, and health. Therefore, developing efficient treatment delivery methods for insomnia can have significant societal and personal health impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is the recommended first-line treatment of insomnia but access is currently limited for patients, since treatment must occur in specialty sleep clinics, which suffer from an insufficient number of trained clinicians. Smartphone-based interventions offer a promising means for improving the delivery of CBTI. Furthermore, novel features such as real-time monitoring and assessment, personalization, dynamic adaptations of the intervention, and context awareness can enhance treatment personalization and effectiveness, and reduce associated costs. Ultimately, this ""Just in Time Adaptive Intervention"" for insomnia-an intervention approach that is acceptable to patients and clinicians, and is based on mobile health (mHealth) platform and tools-can significantly improve patient access and clinician delivery of evidence-based insomnia treatments.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to develop and assess the usability of a Just in Time Adaptive Intervention application platform called iREST (""interactive Resilience Enhancing Sleep Tactics"") for use in behavioral insomnia interventions. iREST can be used by both patients and clinicians.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The development of iREST was based on the Iterative and Incremental Development software development model. Requirement analysis was based on the case study's description, workflow and needs, clinician inputs, and a previously conducted BBTI military study/implementation of the Just in Time Adaptive Intervention architecture. To evaluate the usability of the iREST mHealth tool, a pilot usability study was conducted. Additionally, this study explores the feasibility of using an off-the-shelf wearable device to supplement the subjective assessment of patient sleep patterns.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The iREST app was developed from the mobile logical architecture of Just in Time Adaptive Intervention. It consists of a cross-platform smartphone app, a clinician portal, and secure 2-way communications platform between the app and the portal. The usability study comprised 19 Active Duty Service Members and Veterans between the ages of 18 and 60. Descriptive statistics based on in-app questionnaires indicate that on average, 12 (mean 12.23, SD 8.96) unique devices accessed the clinician portal per day for more than two years, while the app was rated as ""highly usable"", achieving a mean System Usability Score score of 85.74 (SD 12.37), which translates to an adjective rating of ""Excellent"". The participants also gave high scores on ""ease of use and learnability"" with an average score of 4.33 (SD 0.65) on a scale of 1 to 5.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      iREST provides a feasible platform for the implementation of Just in Time Adaptive Intervention in mHealth-based and remote intervention settings. The system was rated highly usable and its cross-platformness made it readily implemented within the heavily segregated smartphone market. The use of wearables to track sleep is promising; yet the accuracy of this technology needs further improvement. Ultimately, iREST demonstrates that mHealth-based Just in Time Adaptive Intervention is not only feasible, but also works effectively.",3
86,An analysis of usability evaluation practices and contexts of use in wearable robotics,"Background:
        
      
      User-centered design approaches have gained attention over the past decade, aiming to tackle the technology acceptance issues of wearable robotic devices to assist, support or augment human capabilities. While there is a consensus that usability is key to user-centered design, dedicated usability evaluation studies are scarce and clear evaluation guidelines are missing. However, the careful consideration and integration of user needs appears to be essential to successfully develop an effective, efficient, and satisfactory human-robot interaction. It is primarily the responsibility of the developer, to ensure that this users involvement takes place throughout the design process.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Through an online survey for developers of wearable robotics, we wanted to understand how the design and evaluation in actual daily practice compares to what is reported in literature. With a total of 31 questions, we analyzed the most common wearable robotic device applications and their technology maturity, and how these influence usability evaluation practices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 158 responses from a heterogeneous population were collected and analyzed. The dataset representing contexts of use for augmentation (16.5%), assistance (38.0%), therapy (39.8%), as well as few other specific applications (5.7%), allowed for an insightful analysis of the influence of technology maturity on user involvement and usability evaluation. We identified functionality, ease of use, and performance as the most evaluated usability attributes and could specify which measures are used to assess them. Also, we could underline the frequent use of qualitative measures alongside the expected high prevalence of performance-metrics. In conclusion of the analysis, we derived evaluation recommendations to foster user-centered design and usability evaluation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This analysis might serve as state-of-the-art comparison and recommendation for usability studies in wearable robotics. We believe that by motivating for more balanced, comparable and user-oriented evaluation practices, we may support the wearable robotics field in tackling the technology acceptance limitations.",4
87,Human emotion classification based on multiple physiological signals by wearable system,"Background:
        
      
      Human emotion classification is traditionally achieved using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, which requires costly equipment and complex classification algorithms.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The experiments can be implemented in the laboratory environment equipped with high-performance computers for the online analysis; this will hinder the usability in practical applications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Considering that other physiological signals are also associated with emotional changes, this paper proposes to use a wearable, wireless system to acquire a single-channel electroencephalogram signal, respiration, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, and body postures to explore the relationship between these signals and the human emotions.
    


          Results and conclusions:
        
      
      Compared with traditional emotion classification method, the presented method was able to extract a small number of key features associated with human emotions from multiple physiological signals, where the algorithm complexity was greatly reduced when incorporated with the support vector machine classification. The proposed method can support an embedded on-line analysis and may enhance the usability of emotion classification.",0
88,An Integrated Multi-Sensor Approach for the Remote Monitoring of Parkinson's Disease,"The increment of the prevalence of neurological diseases due to the trend in population aging demands for new strategies in disease management. In Parkinson's disease (PD), these strategies should aim at improving diagnosis accuracy and frequency of the clinical follow-up by means of decentralized cost-effective solutions. In this context, a system suitable for the remote monitoring of PD subjects is presented. It consists of the integration of two approaches investigated in our previous works, each one appropriate for the movement analysis of specific parts of the body: low-cost optical devices for the upper limbs and wearable sensors for the lower ones. The system performs the automated assessments of six motor tasks of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, and it is equipped with a gesture-based human machine interface designed to facilitate the user interaction and the system management. The usability of the system has been evaluated by means of standard questionnaires, and the accuracy of the automated assessment has been verified experimentally. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution represents a substantial improvement in PD assessment respect to the former two approaches treated separately, and a new example of an accurate, feasible and cost-effective mean for the decentralized management of PD.",2
89,Review on the Integration of Microelectronics for E-Textile,"Modern electronic textiles are moving towards flexible wearable textiles, so-called e-textiles that have micro-electronic elements embedded onto the textile fabric that can be used for varied classes of functionalities. There are different methods of integrating rigid microelectronic components into/onto textiles for the development of smart textiles, which include, but are not limited to, physical, mechanical, and chemical approaches. The integration systems must satisfy being flexible, lightweight, stretchable, and washable to offer a superior usability, comfortability, and non-intrusiveness. Furthermore, the resulting wearable garment needs to be breathable. In this review work, three levels of integration of the microelectronics into/onto the textile structures are discussed, the textile-adapted, the textile-integrated, and the textile-based integration. The textile-integrated and the textile-adapted e-textiles have failed to efficiently meet being flexible and washable. To overcome the above problems, researchers studied the integration of microelectronics into/onto textile at fiber or yarn level applying various mechanisms. Hence, a new method of integration, textile-based, has risen to the challenge due to the flexibility and washability advantages of the ultimate product. In general, the aim of this review is to provide a complete overview of the different interconnection methods of electronic components into/onto textile substrate.",0
90,Efficacy and Safety of an mHealth App and Wearable Device in Physical Performance for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Exercise is predicted to have a positive effect among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, these patients are hesitant to start and build up an exercise program for one major reason: the vague fear of developing hepatic decompensation, a potentially fatal condition that can lead to death. Integrating mobile health (mHealth) with individualized exercise programs could be a possible option for promoting physical capacity among HCC patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rehabilitation exercises, which have been individually prescribed via an mHealth app, on physical fitness, body composition, biochemical profile, and quality of life among HCC patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 37 HCC patients were enrolled in a 12-week course with an mHealth app program targeted to HCC patients. The wearable wristband device Neofit (Partron Co) was provided to participants, and recorded daily physical data, such as the number of steps, calorie expenditure, exercise time, and heart rate. Each participant was given an individualized rehabilitation exercise program that was prescribed and adjusted at the 6-week midintervention period based on the assessment results. At baseline, 6-week, and 12-week sessions, participants' physical fitness levels (ie, 6-minute walk test, grip strength test, and 30-second chair stand test) were measured. Physical activity levels, as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF); body composition (ie, body mass index, body fat percentage, and muscle mass); biochemical profiles; and quality of life, as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30, were assessed at baseline and at the end point. At the 6-week midpoint, exercise intensity was individually adjusted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 37 patients, 31 (84%) completed the 12-week intervention. Grip strength improved significantly after 12 weeks of the intervention. The 30-second chair stand test and the 6-minute walk test showed significant improvement from 0 to 6 weeks, from 0 to 12 weeks, and from 6 to 12 weeks. Muscle mass and the IPAQ-SF score increased significantly after 12 weeks of the intervention without biochemical deterioration.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Following 12 weeks of mHealth care, including an individually prescribed rehabilitation exercise program, we saw significant improvements in physical fitness, body composition, and physical activity without any complication or biochemical deterioration among compensated HCC patients who had completed therapy.",8
91,"Measuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors: Insights Into the Accuracy, Obtrusiveness, and Research Usability of Three Instruments","The affordability of wearable psychophysiological sensors has led to opportunities to measure the mental workload of operators in complex sociotechnical systems in ways that are more objective and less obtrusive. This study primarily focuses on the sensors themselves by investigating low-cost and wearable sensors in terms of their accuracy, obtrusiveness, and usability for research purposes. Two sensors were assessed on their accuracy as tools to measure mental workload through heart rate variability (HRV): the E3 from Empatica and the emWave Pro from HeartMath. The BioPatch from Zephyr Technology, which is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved device, was used as a gold standard to compare the data obtained from the other 2 devices regarding their accuracy on HRV. Linear dependencies for 6 of 10 HRV parameters were found between the emWave and BioPatch data and for 1 of 10 for the E3 sensor. In terms of research usability, both the E3 and the BioPatch had difficulty acquiring either sufficiently high data recording confidence values or normal distributions. However, the BioPatch output files do not require postprocessing, which reduces costs and effort in the analysis stage. None of the sensors was perceived as obtrusive by the participants.",0
92,"Experiences of using a wearable camera to record activity, participation and health-related behaviours: Qualitative reflections of using the Sensecam","Objective:
        
      
      Upcoming technology is changing the way that we are able to collect data looking into activity, social participation and health behaviours. Wearable cameras are one form of technology that allows us to automatically record a collection of passive images, building a visual diary of the user's day. Whilst acknowledging the usefulness of wearable cameras in research, it is also important to understand individuals' experiences whilst using them. The aim of this study was to explore the acceptance, experience and usability of a wearable camera (Microsoft® Sensecam) to record the day-to-day activity and social participation of older people.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 18 older adults, who had worn the wearable camera for seven days, took part in semi-structured interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four themes emerged from the findings: 'Intrusiveness'; 'Importance of others'; 'Remembering the wearable camera'; and 'Ease of use'.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Individuals' expectations and experiences of using the wearable camera differed considerably. Participants believed that the wearable camera would be intrusive, difficult to use and would evoke public reaction; however, these worries were not borne out in experience. Individuals typically forgot about the presence of the wearable camera during use, remembering it only sporadically. One drawback to its use is that some participants were cautious of using the camera when around others, which impacted the amount of time the camera was worn, and, therefore, the nature of the data recorded. Design issues of the Sensecam were also a problem for the older adults in the study and affected their interaction with the technology.",3
93,Perceptions on wearable sensor-based interventions for monitoring of opioid therapy: A qualitative study,"Prescription opioid use is a risk factor for the development of opioid use disorder. Digital solutions, including wearable sensors, represent a promising opportunity for health monitoring, risk stratification and harm reduction in this treatment space. However, data on their usability and acceptability in individuals using opioids is limited. To address this gap, factors that impact usability and acceptability of wearable sensor-based opioid detection were qualitatively studied in participants enrolled in a wearable sensor-based opioid monitoring research study. At the conclusion of the monitoring period, participants were invited to take part in semi-structured interviews developed based on the technology acceptance model. Thematic analysis was conducted first using deductive, then inductive coding strategies. Forty-four participants completed the interview; approximately half were female. Major emergent themes include sensor usability, change in behavior and thought process related to sensor use, perceived usefulness in sensor-based monitoring, and willingness to have opioid use patterns monitored. Overall acceptance for sensor-based monitoring was high. Aesthetics, simplicity, and seamless functioning were all reported as key to usability. Perceived behavior changes related to monitoring were infrequent while perceived usefulness in monitoring was frequently projected onto others, requiring careful consideration regarding intervention development and targeting. Specifically, care must be taken to avoid stigma associated with opioid use and implied misuse. The design of sensor systems targeted for opioid use must also consider the physical, social, and cognitive alterations inherent in the respective disease processes compared to routine daily life.",2
94,Development and Performance Evaluation of Wearable Respiratory Self-Training System Using Patch Type Magnetic Sensor,"Purpose:
        
      
      Respiratory training system that can be used by patients themselves was developed with a micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS)-based patch-type magnetic sensor. We conducted a basic function test and clinical usability evaluation to determine the system's clinical applicability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The system is designed with a sensor attached to the patient's chest and a magnet on the back to monitor the patient's respiration by measuring changes in magnetic intensity related to respiratory movements of the thoracic surface. The system comprises a MEMS-based patch-type magnetic sensor capable of wireless communication and being applied to measurement magnets and mobile applications. System performance was evaluated by the level of systemic noise, the precision of the sensor in various breathing patterns, how measurement signals change for varying distances, or the presence or absence of material between the sensor and the magnet. Various breathing patterns were created using the QUASAR respiratory motion phantom; the data obtained were analyzed using the fitting and peak value analysis methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The sensor had a noise ratio of <0.54% of the signal; the average errors in signal amplitude and period for breathing patterns were 78.87 um and 72 ms, respectively. The signal could be measured consistently when the sensor-magnet distance was 10-25 cm. The signal difference was 1.89% for the presence or absence of a material, indicating that its influence on the measurement signal is relatively small.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The potential of our MEMS-based patch-type wearable respiratory self-training system was confirmed via basic function tests and clinical usability evaluations. We believe that the training system could provide thorough respiratory training for patients after a clinical trial with actual patients confirming its clinical efficacy and usability.",7
95,GeriActive: Wearable App for Monitoring and Encouraging Physical Activity among Older Adults,"The ability to monitor a person's level of daily activity can inform self-management of physical activity and assist in augmenting behavioral interventions. For older adults, the importance of regular physical activity is critical to reduce the risk of long-term disability. In this work, we present GeriActive, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn device that monitors in real time older adults' daily activity levels (low, moderate and vigorous), which we categorized using metabolic equivalents (METs). The app implements an activity-level detection model we developed using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). We trained our model using data from volunteer subjects (n=29) who performed common physical activities (sit, stand, lay down, walk and run) and obtained an accuracy of 94.3% with leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation. We ran a week-long field study to evaluate the usability and battery life of the GeriActive system where 5 older adults wore the Amulet as it monitored their activity level. Their feedback showed that our system has the potential to be usable and useful. Our evaluation further revealed a battery life of at least 1 week. The results are promising, indicating that the app may be used for activity-level monitoring by individuals or researchers for health delivery interventions that could improve the health of older adults.",1
96,A Pilot Study on an Integrated Service Based on Wearable Textile Platforms to promote Workers Wellness at Workplace,"This paper describes a study performed in the frame of Wearables project and reports preliminary results. Objective of the study was the implementation of an integrated service finalized to increase employees' well-being through the investigation on the correlation between daily working activity and the observed physical parameters. The project monitored 28 volunteers employed in the field of waste collection (at the Amey's contract with Wolverhampton City Council), for a total of 275 data acquisition sessions. The study has been performed using sensing textiles, to collect objective work-correlated parameters during daily activity, aiming at the acquisition of objective indicators for an improved wellbeing. Physical parameters like heart rate, energy expenditure and heart rate activity-zones distribution have been evaluated from data acquired during normal working activity. The service produced encouraging results both in terms of monitoring individual subjects and in identifying trends correlated to different roles or tasks covered by workers. Also in term of usability and acceptability the system showed interesting potentialities, proving how wearable technologies can trigger innovative approaches and open new prospective in the growing field of workplace wellness.",0
97,EarBit: Using Wearable Sensors to Detect Eating Episodes in Unconstrained Environments,"Chronic and widespread diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia require patients to monitor their food intake, and food journaling is currently the most common method for doing so. However, food journaling is subject to self-bias and recall errors, and is poorly adhered to by patients. In this paper, we propose an alternative by introducing EarBit, a wearable system that detects eating moments. We evaluate the performance of inertial, optical, and acoustic sensing modalities and focus on inertial sensing, by virtue of its recognition and usability performance. Using data collected in a simulated home setting with minimum restrictions on participants' behavior, we build our models and evaluate them with an unconstrained outside-the-lab study. For both studies, we obtained video footage as ground truth for participants activities. Using leave-one-user-out validation, EarBit recognized all the eating episodes in the semi-controlled lab study, and achieved an accuracy of 90.1% and an F1-score of 90.9% in detecting chewing instances. In the unconstrained, outside-the-lab evaluation, EarBit obtained an accuracy of 93% and an F1-score of 80.1% in detecting chewing instances. It also accurately recognized all but one recorded eating episodes. These episodes ranged from a 2 minute snack to a 30 minute meal.",7
98,Mobile Health for Pediatric Weight Management: Systematic Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      The prevalence and consequences of obesity among children and adolescents remain a leading global public health concern, and evidence-based, multidisciplinary lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of treatment. Mobile electronic devices are widely used across socioeconomic categories and may provide a means of extending the reach and efficiency of health care interventions.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding mobile health (mHealth) for the treatment of childhood overweight and obesity to map the breadth and nature of the literature in this field and describe the characteristics of published studies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic scoping review in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews, by searching nine academic databases in addition to gray literature for studies describing acceptability, usability, feasibility, effectiveness, adherence, or cost-effectiveness of interventions assessing mHealth for childhood obesity treatment. We also hand searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies aimed at the prevention of overweight or obesity were excluded, as were studies in which mHealth was not the primary mode of treatment delivery for at least one study arm or was not independently assessed. A random portion of all abstracts and full texts was double screened by a second reviewer to ensure consistency. Data were charted according to study characteristics, including design, participants, intervention content, behavior change theory (BCT) underpinning the study, mode of delivery, and outcomes measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 42 eligible studies assessing acceptability (n=7), usability (n=2), feasibility or pilot studies (n=15), treatment effect (n=17), and fidelity (n=1). Change in BMI z-scores or percentiles was most commonly measured, among a variety of dietary, physical activity, psychological, and usability or acceptability measures. SMS, mobile apps, and wearable devices made up the majority of mobile interventions, and 69% (29/42) of the studies specified a BCT used.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pediatric weight management using mHealth is an emerging field, with most work to date aimed at developing and piloting such interventions. Few large trials are published, and these are heterogeneous in nature and rarely reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for eHealth guidelines. There is an evidence gap in the cost-effectiveness analyses of such studies.",4
99,Consumer-Based Activity Trackers as a Tool for Physical Activity Monitoring in Epidemiological Studies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Consumer-based physical activity trackers have increased in popularity. The widespread use of these devices and the long-term nature of the recorded data provides a valuable source of physical activity data for epidemiological research. The challenges include the large heterogeneity between activity tracker models in terms of available data types, the accuracy of recorded data, and how this data can be shared between different providers and third-party systems.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to develop a system to record data on physical activity from different providers of consumer-based activity trackers and to examine its usability as a tool for physical activity monitoring in epidemiological research. The longitudinal nature of the data and the concurrent pandemic outbreak allowed us to show how the system can be used for surveillance of physical activity levels before, during, and after a COVID-19 lockdown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a system (mSpider) for automatic recording of data on physical activity from participants wearing activity trackers from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Polar, Samsung, and Withings, as well as trackers storing data in Google Fit and Apple Health. To test the system throughout development, we recruited 35 volunteers to wear a provided activity tracker from early 2019 and onward. In addition, we recruited 113 participants with privately owned activity trackers worn before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway. We examined monthly changes in the number of steps, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and activity energy expenditure between 2019 and 2020 using bar plots and two-sided paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared to March 2019, there was a significant reduction in mean step count and mean activity energy expenditure during the March 2020 lockdown period. The reduction in steps and activity energy expenditure was temporary, and the following monthly comparisons showed no significant change between 2019 and 2020. A small significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for several monthly comparisons after the lockdown period and when comparing March-December 2019 with March-December 2020.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      mSpider is a working prototype currently able to record physical activity data from providers of consumer-based activity trackers. The system was successfully used to examine changes in physical activity levels during the COVID-19 period.",1
100,Mobile Health Technology for Pediatric Symptom Monitoring: A Feasibility Study,"Background:
        
      
      Pediatric blood and marrow transplant (PBMT) patients experience significant symptom distress. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can be leveraged to improve understanding of the patient's symptom experience by providing continuous, real-time, in situ, patient-generated symptom data. This rich data stream can subsequently enhance symptom management strategies. However, limited research has been conducted in this area.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This pilot study seeks to (a) explore the feasibility of integrating mHealth technologies to monitor symptom data for PBMT patients and (b) evaluate the study design, measures, and procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An exploratory longitudinal design was employed to assess the feasibility of monitoring 10 PBMT patients' symptoms using data from two mHealth technologies: (a) a smartphone mHealth application (app) to collect symptom data and (b) a wearable tracking device (Apple watch) to collect physiological data. Feasibility was measured as usability and acceptability. Monthly patient interviews and an end-of-study feasibility survey were employed and analyzed to further understand reasons for sustained interest in and attrition from the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall usability of the wearable was 51%, and app was 56%. Children reported devices were easy to use and acceptable. The study demonstrated acceptability with an enrollment rate of 83% and an attrition rate of 30%, with 70% of the children remaining in the study for at least 40 days.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This pilot study is among the first to explore the feasibility of using mobile technologies to longitudinally obtain patient-generated symptom data to enhance understanding of the PBMT symptom experience. In addition, it will improve our understanding of how these data present, interact, and cluster together throughout the posttransplant period.",6
101,Applying Human-Centered Design to the Development of an Asthma Essentials Kit for School-Aged Children and Their Parents,"This study aimed to design and test an asthma essentials kit to support parent-child shared asthma management. Fourteen children (age range = 7-11 years) with asthma and their parents participated in this study. Development of the asthma essentials kit involved a generative phase, focused on understanding and designing to meet user needs, and an evaluative phase, which entailed narrowing, evaluating, and refining the asthma essentials kit. As is typical in human-centered design, analysis was iterative throughout the design process such that findings informed each subsequent phase. The final asthma essentials kit concepts collectively addressed the three user-identified priorities: roles and responsibilities, desire for normalcy, and shared asthma management. Concept prototypes included a to-go bag, cue card, wearable device, and mobile health application. Usability and acceptability testing showed that the asthma essentials kit prototypes were highly useful, acceptable, and easy to navigate. Human-centered design holds promise in developing interventions to meet user needs.",3
102,Usability test of a hand exoskeleton for activities of daily living: an example of user-centered design,"Purpose:
        
      
      (1) To assess a robotic device (Handexos) during the design process with regard to usability, end user satisfaction and safety, (2) to determine whether Handexos can improve the activities of daily living (ADLs) of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and stroke patients with upper-limb dysfunction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      During a 2-year development stage of the device, a total of 37 participants (aged 22-68), 28 clinicians (experts) and nine patients with SCI or stroke (end users) were included in a user-centered design process featuring usability tests. They performed five grasps wearing the device. The assessments were obtained at the end of the session by filling out a questionnaire and making suggestions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The experts' opinion was that the modified device was an improvement over the preliminary version, although this was not reflected in the scores. Whereas end user scores for comfort, grasp, performance and safety were above the sufficiency threshold, the scores for year 2 were lower than those for year 1.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings demonstrate that although Handexos meets the initial functional requirements and underlines the potential for assisting SCI and post-stroke subjects in ADLs, several aspects such as mechanical complexity and low adaptability to different hand sizes need to be further addressed. Implications for Rehabilitation Wearable robotics devices could improve the activities of daily living in patients with spinal cord injury or stroke. They could be a tool for rehabilitation of the upper limb. Further usability tests to improve this type of tools are recommended.",3

      Wearable sensors (WS) can accurately measure body motion and provide interactive feedback for supporting motor learning.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This review aims to summarize current evidence for the effectiveness of WS training for improving balance, gait and functional performance.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a WS exercise program were included. Study quality was examined by the PEDro scale. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of WS balance training on the most frequently reported outcome parameters.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight RCTs were included (Parkinson n = 2, stroke n = 1, Parkinson/stroke n = 1, peripheral neuropathy n = 2, frail older adults n = 1, healthy older adults n = 1). The sample size ranged from n = 20 to 40. Three types of training paradigms were used: (1) static steady-state balance training, (2) dynamic steady-state balance training, which includes gait training, and (3) proactive balance training. RCTs either used one type of training paradigm (type 2: n = 1, type 3: n = 3) or combined different types of training paradigms within their intervention (type 1 and 2: n = 2; all types: n = 2). The meta-analyses revealed significant overall effects of WS training on static steady-state balance outcomes including mediolateral (eyes open: Hedges' g = 0.82, CI: 0.43-1.21; eyes closed: g = 0.57, CI: 0.14-0.99) and anterior-posterior sway (eyes open: g = 0.55, CI: 0.01-1.10; eyes closed: g = 0.44, CI: 0.02-0.86). No effects on habitual gait speed were found in the meta-analysis (g = -0.19, CI: -0.68 to 0.29). Two RCTs reported significant improvements for selected gait variables including single support time, and fast gait speed. One study identified effects on proactive balance (Alternate Step Test), but no effects were found for the Timed Up and Go test and the Berg Balance Scale. Two studies reported positive results on feasibility and usability. Only one study was performed in an unsupervised setting.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This review provides evidence for a positive effect of WS training on static steady-state balance in studies with usual care controls and studies with conventional balance training controls. Specific gait parameters and proactive balance measures may also be improved by WS training, yet limited evidence is available. Heterogeneous training paradigms, small sample sizes, and short intervention durations limit the validity of our findings. Larger studies are required for estimating the true potential of WS technology.",4
104,A Systematic Review of Wearable Sensors and IoT-Based Monitoring Applications for Older Adults - a Focus on Ageing Population and Independent Living,"This review aims to present current advancements in wearable technologies and IoT-based applications to support independent living. The secondary aim was to investigate the barriers and challenges of wearable sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) monitoring solutions for older adults. For this work, we considered falls and activity of daily life (ADLs) for the ageing population (older adults). A total of 327 articles were screened, and 14 articles were selected for this review. This review considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2019. The research articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and studies that support or present a vision to provide advancement to the current space of ADLs, independent living and supporting the ageing population. Most studies focused on the system aspects of wearable sensors and IoT monitoring solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and usability. Moderate to low usability/ user-friendly approach is reported in most of the studies. Other issues found were inaccurate sensors, battery/ power issues, restricting the users within the monitoring area/ space and lack of interoperability. The advancement of wearable technology and the possibilities of using advanced IoT technology to assist older adults with their ADLs and independent living is the subject of many recent research and investigation.",2
105,Sustained Acoustic Medicine Combined with A Diclofenac Ultrasound Coupling Patch for the Rapid Symptomatic Relief of Knee Osteoarthritis: Multi-Site Clinical Efficacy Study,"Background:
        
      
      Sustained Acoustic Medicine (SAM) is an emerging, non-invasive, non-narcotic, home-use ultrasound therapy for the daily treatment of joint pain. The aim of this multi-site clinical study was to examine the efficacy of long-duration continuous ultrasound combined with a 1% diclofenac ultrasound gel patch in treating pain and improving function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) were followed. Thirty-two (32) patients (18-males, 14-females) 54 years of average age with moderate to severe knee pain and radiographically confirmed knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade II/III) were enrolled for treatment with the SAM device and diclofenac patch applied daily to the treated knee. SAM ultrasound (3 MHz, 0.132 W/cm2, 1.3 W) and 6 grams of 1% diclofenac were applied with a wearable device for 4 hours daily for 1 week, delivering 18,720 Joules of ultrasound energy per treatment. The primary outcome was the daily change in pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10), which was assessed prior to intervention (baseline, day 1), before and after each daily treatment, and after 1 week of daily treatment (day 7). Rapid responders were classified as those patients exhibiting greater than a 1-point reduction in pain following the first treatment. Change in Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Questionnaire (WOMAC) score from baseline to day 7 was the secondary functional outcome measure. Additionally, a series of daily usability and user experience questions related to devising ease of use, functionality, safety, and effectiveness, were collected. Data were analyzed using t-tests and repeated measure ANOVAs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study had a 94% retention rate, and there were no adverse events or study-related complaints across 224 unique treatment sessions. Rapid responders included 75% of the study population. Patients exhibited a significant mean NRS pain reduction over the 7-day study of 2.06-points (50%) for all subjects (n=32, p<0.001) and 2.96-points (70%) for rapid responders (n=24, p<0.001). The WOMAC functional score significantly improved by 351 points for all subjects (n=32, p<0.001), and 510 points for rapid responders (n=24, p<0.001). Over 95% of patients found the device safe, effective and easy to use, and would continue treatment for their knee OA symptoms.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Sustained Acoustic Medicine combined with 1% topical diclofenac rapidly reduced pain and improved function in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis-related knee pain. The clinical findings suggest that this treatment approach may be used as a conservative, non-invasive treatment option for patients with knee osteoarthritis. Additional research is warranted on non-weight bearing joints of the musculoskeletal system as well as different topical drugs that could benefit from improved localized delivery.Clinical Trial Registry Number: (NCT04391842).",5
106,The use of wearable devices in preventing hospital readmission and in improving the quality of life of chronic patients in the homecare Setting: A Narrative Literature Review,"Introduction:
        
      
      According to the World Health Organisation chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the world, representing 60% of all deaths. Strategies employed to tackle chronic diseases aim to act on risk factors through adopting a healthy lifestyle. These strategies can be greatly implemented from the adoption of wearable devices, which allow a thorough and mini- mally invasive monitoring of patients' clinical data. This article aims to clarify whether wearable devices can help in preventing hospital readmission and improve quality of life in chronic patients.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A literature search of electronic databases was performed in January 2017. The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Pub Med, EMBASE and MEDLINE.
    


          Results:
        
      
      33 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the literature review.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Various wearable devices are currently available to monitor and keep records of diffe- rent clinical information. Some of them are proved to prevent hospital re-admissions and to treat effectively life-threatening situations in certain categories of chronic patients. Higher level of acceptability and usability are achieved when users are involved in the testing stage prior to the release of the device and/or the features and terms of use are clearly described to patients and carers. Wearable devices are also proved to be more accurate than clinical assessment only in estimating the risk of falls in chronic patients, thus improving safety in the home care setting. Regardless of their features, wearable devices are yet to be used by both healthcare professionals and patients on a large scale.",2
107,"Remote Actuation Systems for Fully Wearable Assistive Devices: Requirements, Selection, and Optimization for Out-of-the-Lab Application of a Hand Exoskeleton","Wearable robots assist individuals with sensorimotor impairment in daily life, or support industrial workers in physically demanding tasks. In such scenarios, low mass and compact design are crucial factors for device acceptance. Remote actuation systems (RAS) have emerged as a popular approach in wearable robots to reduce perceived weight and increase usability. Different RAS have been presented in the literature to accommodate for a wide range of applications and related design requirements. The push toward use of wearable robotics in out-of-the-lab applications in clinics, home environments, or industry created a shift in requirements for RAS. In this context, high durability, ergonomics, and simple maintenance gain in importance. However, these are only rarely considered and evaluated in research publications, despite being drivers for device abandonment by end-users. In this paper, we summarize existing approaches of RAS for wearable assistive technology in a literature review and compare advantages and disadvantages, focusing on specific evaluation criteria for out-of-the-lab applications to provide guidelines for the selection of RAS. Based on the gained insights, we present the development, optimization, and evaluation of a cable-based RAS for out-of-the-lab applications in a wearable assistive soft hand exoskeleton. The presented RAS features full wearability, high durability, high efficiency, and appealing design while fulfilling ergonomic criteria such as low mass and high wearing comfort. This work aims to support the transfer of RAS for wearable robotics from controlled lab environments to out-of-the-lab applications.",0
108,Detachable Robotic Grippers for Human-Robot Collaboration,"Collaborative robots promise to add flexibility to production cells thanks to the fact that they can work not only close to humans but also with humans. The possibility of a direct physical interaction between humans and robots allows to perform operations that were inconceivable with industrial robots. Collaborative soft grippers have been recently introduced to extend this possibility beyond the robot end-effector, making humans able to directly act on robotic hands. In this work, we propose to exploit collaborative grippers in a novel paradigm in which these devices can be easily attached and detached from the robot arm and used also independently from it. This is possible only with self-powered hands, that are still quite uncommon in the market. In the presented paradigm not only hands can be attached/detached to/from the robot end-effector as if they were simple tools, but they can also remain active and fully functional after detachment. This ensures all the advantages brought in by tool changers, that allow for quick and possibly automatic tool exchange at the robot end-effector, but also gives the possibility of using the hand capabilities and degrees of freedom without the need of an arm or of external power supplies. In this paper, the concept of detachable robotic grippers is introduced and demonstrated through two illustrative tasks conducted with a new tool changer designed for collaborative grippers. The novel tool changer embeds electromagnets that are used to add safety during attach/detach operations. The activation of the electromagnets is controlled through a wearable interface capable of providing tactile feedback. The usability of the system is confirmed by the evaluations of 12 users.",0
109,Mobile Phone and Wearable Sensor-Based mHealth Approaches for Psychiatric Disorders and Symptoms: Systematic Review,"Background:
        
      
      Mobile Therapeutic Attention for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (m-RESIST) is an EU Horizon 2020-funded project aimed at designing and validating an innovative therapeutic program for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The program exploits information from mobile phones and wearable sensors for behavioral tracking to support intervention administration.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review original studies on sensor-based mHealth apps aimed at uncovering associations between sensor data and symptoms of psychiatric disorders in order to support the m-RESIST approach to assess effectiveness of behavioral monitoring in therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of the English-language literature, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was performed through Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Studies published between September 1, 2009, and September 30, 2018, were selected. Boolean search operators with an iterative combination of search terms were applied.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Studies reporting quantitative information on data collected from mobile use and/or wearable sensors, and where that information was associated with clinical outcomes, were included. A total of 35 studies were identified; most of them investigated bipolar disorders, depression, depression symptoms, stress, and symptoms of stress, while only a few studies addressed persons with schizophrenia. The data from sensors were associated with symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and depression.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although the data from sensors demonstrated an association with the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and depression, their usability in clinical settings to support therapeutic intervention is not yet fully assessed and needs to be scrutinized more thoroughly.",4
110,Cost-Effective Wearable Indoor Localization and Motion Analysis via the Integration of UWB and IMU,"Wearable indoor localization can now find applications in a wide spectrum of fields, including the care of children and the elderly, sports motion analysis, rehabilitation medicine, robotics navigation, etc. Conventional inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based position estimation and radio signal indoor localization methods based on WiFi, Bluetooth, ultra-wide band (UWB), and radio frequency identification (RFID) all have their limitations regarding cost, accuracy, or usability, and a combination of the techniques has been considered a promising way to improve the accuracy. This investigation aims to provide a cost-effective wearable sensing solution with data fusion algorithms for indoor localization and real-time motion analysis. The main contributions of this investigation are: (1) the design of a wireless, battery-powered, and light-weight wearable sensing device integrating a low-cost UWB module-DWM1000 and micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) IMU-MPU9250 for synchronized measurement; (2) the implementation of a Mahony complementary filter for noise cancellation and attitude calculation, and quaternions for frame rotation to obtain the continuous attitude for displacement estimation; (3) the development of a data fusion model integrating the IMU and UWB data to enhance the measurement accuracy using Kalman-filter-based time-domain iterative compensations; and (4) evaluation of the developed sensor module by comparing it with UWB- and IMU-only solutions. The test results demonstrate that the average error of the integrated module reached 7.58 cm for an arbitrary walking path, which outperformed the IMU- and UWB-only localization solutions. The module could recognize lateral roll rotations during normal walking, which could be potentially used for abnormal gait recognition.",7
111,Multimodal Photoplethysmography-Based Approaches for Improved Detection of Hypertension,"Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of death, yet hypertension commonly goes undetected. Owing to its nature, it is typically asymptomatic until later in its progression when the vessel or organ structure has already been compromised. Therefore, noninvasive and continuous BP measurement methods are needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and early management before hypertension leads to irreversible complications. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technology with waveform morphologies similar to that of arterial BP waveforms, therefore attracting interest regarding its usability in BP estimation. In recent years, wearable devices incorporating PPG sensors have been proposed to improve the early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Additionally, the need for improved accuracy and convenience has led to the development of devices that incorporate multiple different biosignals with PPG. Through the addition of modalities such as an electrocardiogram, a final measure of the pulse wave velocity is derived, which has been proved to be inversely correlated to BP and to yield accurate estimations. This paper reviews and summarizes recent studies within the period 2010-2019 that combined PPG with other biosignals and offers perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of current developments to guide future advancements in BP measurement. Our literature review reveals promising measurement accuracies and we comment on the effective combinations of modalities and success of this technology.",5
112,Digital reminiscence app co-created by people living with dementia and carers: Usability and eye gaze analysis,"Background:
        
      
      This research reports on a pilot study that examined the usability of a reminiscence app called 'InspireD' using eye tracking technology. The InspireD app is a bespoke digital intervention aimed at supporting personalized reminiscence for people living with dementia and their carers. The app was developed and refined in two co-creation workshops and subsequently tested in a third workshop using eye tracking technology.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Eye tracking was used to gain insight into the user's cognition since our previous work showed that the think-aloud protocol can add to cognitive burden for people living with dementia while also making the test more unnatural.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results showed that there were no barriers to using a wearable eye tracker in this setting and participants were able to use the reminiscence app freely. However, some tasks required prompts from the observer when difficulties arose. While prompts are not normally used in usability testing (as some argue the prompting defeats the purpose of testing), we used 'prompt frequency' as a proxy for measuring the intuitiveness of the task. There was a correlation between task completion rates and prompt frequency. Results also showed that people living with dementia had fewer gaze fixations when compared to their carers. Carers had greater fixation and saccadic frequencies when compared to people living with dementia. This perhaps indicates that people living with dementia take more time to scan and consume information on an app. A number of identified usability issues are also discussed in the paper.
    


          Patient or public contribution:
        
      
      The study presents findings from three workshops which looked at user needs analysis, feedback and an eye tracking usability test combined involving 14 participants, 9 of whom were people living with dementia and the remaining 5 were carers.",3
113,HuMOVE: a low-invasive wearable monitoring platform in sexual medicine,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate an accelerometer-based wearable system, named Human Movement (HuMOVE) platform, designed to enable quantitative and continuous measurement of sexual performance with minimal invasiveness and inconvenience for users.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Design, implementation, and development of HuMOVE, a wearable platform equipped with an accelerometer sensor for monitoring inertial parameters for sexual performance assessment and diagnosis, were performed. The system enables quantitative measurement of movement parameters during sexual intercourse, meeting the requirements of wearability, data storage, sampling rate, and interfacing methods, which are fundamental for human sexual intercourse performance analysis. HuMOVE was validated through characterization using a controlled experimental test bench and evaluated in a human model during simulated sexual intercourse conditions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      HuMOVE demonstrated to be a robust and quantitative monitoring platform and a reliable candidate for sexual performance evaluation and diagnosis. Characterization analysis on the controlled experimental test bench demonstrated an accurate correlation between the HuMOVE system and data from a reference displacement sensor. Experimental tests in the human model during simulated intercourse conditions confirmed the accuracy of the sexual performance evaluation platform and the effectiveness of the selected and derived parameters. The obtained outcomes also established the project expectations in terms of usability and comfort, evidenced by the questionnaires that highlighted the low invasiveness and acceptance of the device.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To the best of our knowledge, HuMOVE platform is the first device for human sexual performance analysis compatible with sexual intercourse; the system has the potential to be a helpful tool for physicians to accurately classify sexual disorders, such as premature or delayed ejaculation.",5
114,Development of a Wearable Biocueing App (Sense-IT) Among Forensic Psychiatric Outpatients With Aggressive Behavior: Design and Evaluation Study,"Background:
        
      
      The ability to regulate anger is often impaired in forensic psychiatric patients, frequently resulting in aggressive behavior. Although some treatment programs are partially successful in enhancing aggression regulation and reducing recidivism among specific subgroups, generalizable conclusions on the effectiveness of these interventions cannot be drawn to date. In forensic outpatient care, low treatment adherence and a predominant focus on cognitive control in most treatment programs may entail some of the factors impeding treatment. Technology-based interventions may address some of these treatment challenges.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to explore whether a new technology-based biocueing intervention, the Sense-IT app, can be a valuable addition to aggression regulation treatment programs in forensic outpatient care. The Sense-IT app, which provides the user with real-time physiological feedback and behavioral support, is developed to strengthen emotional awareness and facilitate real-life practice. In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate an updated version of the Sense-IT app that is suitable for forensic outpatients with aggressive behavior.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      First, we conducted a design study to assess the attitudes of forensic professionals and patients toward biocueing and to collect requirements for a biocueing app for this specific population. On the basis of this information, we developed an updated version of the Sense-IT app. In an evaluation study, 10 forensic outpatients used the app for 2 weeks. The app's acceptability, usability, and clinical outcomes (aggression, anger, and recognition of bodily signals related to anger) were measured before and after the intervention using both quantitative and qualitative measures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The design study revealed a cautiously positive attitude toward the use of biocueing as an addition to aggression regulation therapy. The evaluation study among forensic outpatients demonstrated moderate acceptability and adequate usability for the new version of the Sense-IT app. Exploratory analysis revealed a significant decrease in trait aggression postintervention; no significant changes were found in other anger-related clinical outcomes. To further increase acceptability and usability, a stable functioning app with self-adjustable settings, the use of smartwatches with a longer battery life, and the use of the patient's own smartphone devices were recommended.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study, which is one of the first attempts to enroll and evaluate the real-life use of a biocueing intervention among forensic outpatients, emphasized the importance of involving both patients and therapists throughout the development and implementation process. In the future, experimental studies, including single-case experimental designs using ecological momentary assessment, should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sense-IT intervention on clinical outcomes. An open attitude toward new technology, allowing exploration of the potential benefits of the Sense-IT app case-by-case, and training of therapists in using the app are expected to facilitate its integration in therapy.",3
115,User experience and clinical effectiveness with two wearable global positioning system devices in home dementia care,"Introduction:
        
      
      The user experience and clinical effectiveness with wearable global positioning system (GPS) devices for persons with dementia (PwDs) and caregivers (CGs) remain unclear although many are available.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using a crossover design, 20 dyads tested two similar commercial GPS watches (products A and B) at home for 4 weeks each. Usability, product functions, design features and product satisfaction at home and the clinic were investigated. Caregiver burden and quality of life assessed clinical effectiveness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The final 17 dyads rated the usability, telephone function, overall design features, font, buttons, and battery life of B significantly better than A. PwDs rated the overall design features and buttons of A significantly better than CGs. Product satisfaction with both products was significantly lower at home. Clinical effectiveness was not found.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      User experience can be improved by optimizing specific product details. This might translate to clinical effectiveness. Social desirability bias may explain different product satisfaction ratings.",4
116,"A Smartphone App to Promote an Active Lifestyle in Lower-Educated Working Young Adults: Development, Usability, Acceptability, and Feasibility Study","Background:
        
      
      Physical activity (PA) levels are problematic in lower-educated working young adults (18-26 years). To promote PA, smartphone apps have great potential, but there is no evidence for their effectiveness in this population. To increase the likelihood that a newly developed app will be effective, formative research and user testing are required.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to describe the development, usability, acceptability, and feasibility of a new theory- and evidence-based smartphone app to promote an active lifestyle in lower-educated working young adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The new app was developed by applying 4 steps. First, determinants important to promote an active lifestyle in this population were selected. Second, evidence-based behavior change techniques were selected to convert the determinants into practical applications. Third, a new smartphone app was developed. Fourth, volunteers (n=11, both lower and higher educated) tested the app on usability, and lower-educated working young adults (n=16) tested its acceptability and feasibility via (think aloud) interviews, a questionnaire, and Google Analytics. The app was accordingly adapted for the final version.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A new Android app, Active Coach, was developed that focused on knowledge, attitude, social support, and self-efficacy (based on outcomes from step 1), and that applied self-regulation techniques (based on outcomes from step 2). The app consists of a 9-week program with personal goals, practical tips, and scientific facts to encourage an active lifestyle. To ensure all-day and automatic self-monitoring of the activity behavior, the Active Coach app works in combination with a wearable activity tracker, the Fitbit Charge. Issues detected by the usability test (eg, text errors, wrong messages) were all fixed. The acceptability and feasibility test showed that participants found the app clear, understandable, and motivating, although some aspects needed to be more personal.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      By applying a stepwise, user-centered approach that regularly consulted the target group, the new app is adapted to their specific needs and preferences. The Active Coach app was overall positively evaluated by the lower-educated working young adults at the end of the development process.",3
117,Using the Technology Acceptance Model to Explore Adolescents' Perspectives on Combining Technologies for Physical Activity Promotion Within an Intervention: Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers and social media have been identified as having the potential to increase physical activity among adolescents, yet little is known about the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the technology by adolescents.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to use the technology acceptance model to explore adolescents' acceptance of wearable activity trackers used in combination with social media within a physical activity intervention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Raising Awareness of Physical Activity study was a 12-week physical activity intervention that combined a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit Flex) with supporting digital materials that were delivered using social media (Facebook). A total of 124 adolescents aged 13 to 14 years randomized to the intervention group (9 schools) participated in focus groups immediately post intervention. Focus groups explored adolescents' perspectives of the intervention and were analyzed using pen profiles using a coding framework based on the technology acceptance model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Adolescents reported that Fitbit Flex was useful as it motivated them to be active and provided feedback about their physical activity levels. However, adolescents typically reported that Fitbit Flex required effort to use, which negatively impacted on their perceived ease of use. Similarly, Facebook was considered to be a useful platform for delivering intervention content. However, adolescents generally noted preferences for using alternative social media websites, which may have impacted on negative perceptions concerning Facebook's ease of use. Perceptions of technological risks included damage to or loss of the device, integrity of data, and challenges with both Fitbit and Facebook being compatible with daily life.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers and social media have the potential to impact adolescents' physical activity levels. The findings from this study suggest that although the adolescents recognized the potential usefulness of the wearable activity trackers and the social media platform, the effort required to use these technologies, as well as the issues concerning risks and compatibility, may have influenced overall engagement and technology acceptance. As wearable activity trackers and social media platforms can change rapidly, future research is needed to examine the factors that may influence the acceptance of specific forms of technology by using the technology acceptance model.

          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective single-center observational feasibility study, 30 cancer patients treated with palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an estimated life expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a smartphone including a pre-installed ""Activity Monitoring"" app and a sensor-equipped bracelet and monitored over a period of 12 weeks starting at discharge from hospital. We report detailed feasibility and usability aspects and comment on patients' acceptance of the wearables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between February 2017 and May 2018 a total of 30 patients were included in the study. From these, 25 participants (83%) completed the whole study period. On average, the bracelet was worn on 53% and smartphone used on 85% of the study days. The completion rate of daily digital questionnaires for subjective ratings (pain and distress scale) was 73%, and 28 patients were able to handle the wearables and to operate the app without major problems. Use of the bracelet was low during the night hours, with a wearing time of 1.7% of all night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remote monitoring of health care status in palliative cancer patients with a limited life expectancy is feasible and patients are able to handle the smartphone and the sensor-equipped bracelet. Feedback towards use of this monitoring system was mostly positive.",6
119,"Second Version of Google Glass as a Wearable Socio-Affective Aid: Positive School Desirability, High Usability, and Theoretical Framework in a Sample of Children with Autism","Background:
        
      
      Computerized smartglasses are being developed as an assistive technology for daily activities in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While smartglasses may be able to help with educational and behavioral needs, their usability and acceptability in children with ASD is largely unknown. There have been reports of negative social perceptions surrounding smartglasses use in mainstream populations, a concern given that assistive technologies may already carry their own stigma. Children with ASD may also have a range of additional behavioral, developmental, and social challenges when asked to use this emerging technology in school and home settings.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The usability and acceptability of Glass Enterprise Edition (Glass), the successor to Google Glass smartglasses, were explored in children with ASD and their caregivers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight children with ASD and their caregivers were recruited to attend a demonstration session with Glass smartglasses the week they were publicly released. The children had a wide range of ability, including limited speech to speaking, and represented a full range of school ages (6 to 17 years). Children and caregivers were interviewed about their experience of using the smartglasses and whether they would use them at school and home.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All 8 children succeeded in using Glass and did not feel stressed (8/8, 100%) or experience any overwhelming sensory or emotional issues during the session (8/8, 100%). All 8 children (8/8, 100%) endorsed that they would be willing to wear and use the device in both home and school settings. Caregivers felt the experience was fun for the children (8/8, 100%), and most caregivers felt the experience was better than they had expected (6/8, 75%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A wide age and ability range of children with ASD used Glass immediately after it was released and found it to be usable and acceptable. Despite concerns about potential stigma or social acceptability, all of the children were prepared to use the technology in both home and school settings. Encouragingly, most caregivers noted a very positive response. There were no behavioral, developmental, or social- or stigma-related concerns during or after the session. Smartglasses may be a useful future technology for children with ASD and are readily accepted for use by children with ASD and their caregivers.",2
120,Usability study of wearable inertial sensors for exergames (WISE) for movement assessment and exercise,"Background:
        
      
      Accurate assessment of movement limitations and compliance monitoring of exercises to restore movement are necessary to tailor treatments for individuals with motor deficits. Although several commercial-grade technologies are available to clinicians for evaluating movement limitations, they require one-on-one time-consuming assessments with limited reproducibility across care settings. To address these limitations, a wearable inertial sensors for exergames (WISE) system has been designed with: (I) an animated virtual coach to deliver instruction and (II) a subject-model whose movements are animated by real-time sensor measurements from the WISE system worn by a subject. This paper examines the WISE system's accuracy and usability for the assessment of upper limb range of motion (ROM).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventeen neurologically intact subjects were recruited to participate in a usability study of the WISE system. The subjects performed five shoulder and elbow exercises for each arm instructed by the animated virtual coach. The accuracy of ROM measurements obtained with the WISE system versus those obtained with the Kinect™ were compared using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the computed joint angles. The subjects additionally completed a system usability scale (SUS) to evaluate the usability of the virtual coach for tutoring ROM exercises.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The absolute agreement between the WISE and Kinect devices was moderate to very good and it was limited because the Kinect sensor suffers from occlusion. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement for the exercises in the coronal and transverse planes were within the acceptable limits of ±10°. The SUS response data produced relatively high third and first quartile scores of 97.5 and 82.5, respectively, with the interquartile range of 15 and the minimum score of 65, suggesting that the subjects were interested in using the animated virtual coach for tutoring ROM exercises.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An animated virtual coach-based WISE system for mHealth is presented, tested, and validated for guided upper limb ROM exercises. Future studies with patient populations will facilitate the use of these devices in clinical and telerehabilitation settings.",3
121,Human factors and usability engineering in the development of SMT-101 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Background:
        
      
      SMT-101, a novel, proprietary, water-resistant wearable infusion pump prefilled with a preset dosage of treprostinil, was designed to address many of the administration-related shortcomings of existing parenteral therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The objective of the human factors (HF) program was to demonstrate that the SMT-101 system is safe and effective when used by patients with PAH, their caregivers, or healthcare providers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The HF program for SMT-101 consisted of 8 studies (148 participants): an ethnographic study, an online survey of patients with PAH, 4 formative studies, a study of the instructions for use (IFU), and a summative study for validation. The pump and IFU were iteratively modified using observational data and participant feedback to inform subsequent improvements throughout the HF program to optimize safe use of SMT-101 before the final study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results of the summative study demonstrated that the design of the SMT-101 wearable, pre-filled infusion pump and IFU are safe and effective for use.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the usability and HF aspects of SMT-101 were developed and refined through a rigorous HF program in patients with PAH and healthcare providers, which culminated in a summative study that validated the usability and use-safety of SMT-101.",0
122,Pilot Evaluations of Two Bluetooth Contact Tracing Approaches on a University Campus: Mixed Methods Study,"Background:
        
      
      Many have proposed the use of Bluetooth technology to help scale up contact tracing for COVID-19. However, much remains unknown about the accuracy of this technology in real-world settings, the attitudes of potential users, and the differences between delivery formats (mobile app vs carriable or wearable devices).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We pilot tested 2 separate Bluetooth contact tracing technologies on a university campus to evaluate their sensitivity and specificity, and to learn from the experiences of the participants.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a convergent mixed methods study design, and participants included graduate students and researchers working on a university campus during June and July 2020. We conducted separate 2-week pilot studies for each Bluetooth technology. The first was for a mobile phone app (""app pilot""), and the second was for a small electronic ""tag"" (""tag pilot""). Participants validated a list of Bluetooth-identified contacts daily and reported additional close contacts not identified by Bluetooth. We used these data to estimate sensitivity and specificity. Participants completed a postparticipation survey regarding appropriateness, usability, acceptability, and adherence, and provided additional feedback via free text. We used tests of proportions to evaluate differences in survey responses between participants from each pilot, paired t tests to measure differences between compatible survey questions, and qualitative analysis to evaluate the survey's free-text responses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 25 participants in the app pilot, 53 contact interactions were identified by Bluetooth and an additional 61 by self-report. Among 17 participants in the tag pilot, 171 contact interactions were identified by Bluetooth and an additional 4 by self-report. The tag had significantly higher sensitivity compared with the app (46/49, 94% vs 35/61, 57%; P<.001), as well as higher specificity (120/126, 95% vs 123/141, 87%; P=.02). Most participants felt that Bluetooth contact tracing was appropriate on campus (26/32, 81%), while significantly fewer participants felt that using other technologies, such as GPS or Wi-Fi, was appropriate (17/31, 55%; P=.02). Most participants preferred technology developed and managed by the university rather than a third party (27/32, 84%) and preferred not to have tracing apps on their personal phones (21/32, 66%), due to ""concerns with privacy."" There were no significant differences in self-reported adherence rates across pilots.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Convenient and carriable Bluetooth technology may improve tracing efficiency while alleviating privacy concerns by shifting data collection away from personal devices. With accuracy comparable to, and in this case, superior to, mobile phone apps, such approaches may be suitable for workplace or school settings with the ability to purchase and maintain physical devices.",4
123,Wrist-worn alcohol biosensors: Applications and usability in behavioral research,"Wrist-worn alcohol biosensor technology has developed rapidly in recent years. These devices are light, easy to wear, relatively inexpensive, and resemble commercial fitness trackers. As a result, they may be more suitable for a wide range of clinical and research applications. In this paper, we describe three pilot projects examining the associations between reported drinking behavior and transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) derived from a new, wrist-worn alcohol biosensor (BACtrack Skyn) in diverse participant groups and settings. Study 1 (N = 3) compared Skyn-derived TAC with that from an ankle-worn alcohol sensor (SCRAM CAM) and breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) in a laboratory setting. Study 2 (N = 10) compared Skyn TAC with BrAC during a naturalistic drinking episode in the field. Study 3 (N = 12) used the Skyn to monitor alcohol use in the field for 2 weeks. Studies 2 and 3 also collected usability and acceptability data from participants. The results of Study 1 showed that the Skyn produced a TAC curve that closely resembled that of the validated SCRAM CAM anklet. In Study 2, Skyn detected drinking for all 10 participants (peak BrAC range: 0.02-0.21) with an average delay of 35.6 ± 10.2 min after the start of self-reported drinking. In Study 3, Skyn reliably recorded continuous TAC data showing multiple drinking episodes over the monitoring period. Participants in Studies 2 and 3 both reported Skyn as highly acceptable. Collectively, the results of these pilot studies show that the Skyn was able to reliably detect drinking events in the laboratory and natural environments. We offer suggestions for further refinements of alcohol biosensors and accompanying analytic software that may facilitate adoption of these devices as cost-effective, user-friendly, and reliable tools to passively and accurately assess alcohol use in the field.",9
124,Short-Term Wearable Sensors for In-Hospital Medical and Surgical Patients: Mixed Methods Analysis of Patient Perspectives,"Background:
        
      
      Continuous vital sign monitoring using wearable sensors may enable early detection of patient deterioration and sepsis.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore patient experiences with wearable sensor technology and carry out continuous monitoring through questionnaire and interview studies in an acute hospital setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were recruited for a wearable sensor study and were asked to complete a 9-item questionnaire. Patients responses were evaluated using a Likert scale and with continuous variables. A subgroup of surgical patients wearing a Sensium Vital Sign Sensor was invited to participate in semistructured interviews. The Sensium wearable sensor measures the vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. All interview data were subjected to thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of a total of 500 patients, 453 (90.6%) completed the questionnaire. Furthermore, 427 (85.4%) patients agreed that the wearable sensor was comfortable, 429 (85.8%) patients agreed to wear the patch again when in hospital, and 398 (79.6%) patients agreed to wear the patch at home. Overall, 12 surgical patients consented to the interviews. Five main themes of interest to patients emerged from the interviews: (1) centralized monitoring, (2) enhanced feelings of patient safety, (3) impact on nursing staff, (4) comfort and usability, and (5) future use and views on technology.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, the feedback from patients using wearable monitoring sensors was strongly positive with relatively few concerns raised. Patients felt that the wearable sensors would improve their sense of safety, relieve pressure on health care staff, and serve as a favorable aspect of future health care technology.",9
125,Local differential privacy protection for wearable device data,"Personal data collected by wearable devices contains rich privacy. It is important to realize the personal privacy protection for user data without affecting the data collection of wearable device services. In order to protect users' personal privacy, a collection scheme based on local differential privacy is proposed for the collected single attribute numerical stream data. At first, the stream data points collected by the wearable device are censored to identify the salient points, and the adaptive Laplacian mechanism is used to add noise to these salient points according to the assigned privacy budget; then the collector reconstructs and fits the stream data curve to the noise-added salient points, so as to protect the personal privacy of the data. This scheme is experimented on the heart rate dataset, and the results show that when the privacy budget is 0.5 (i.e., at higher privacy protection strength), the mean relative error is 0.12, which is 57.78% lower than the scheme of Kim et al. With the satisfaction of user privacy protection, the usability of mean value estimation of wearable device stream data is improved.",8
126,Optimizing usability and signal capture: a proactive risk assessment for the implementation of a wireless vital sign monitoring system,"Wearable vital sign monitors are a promising step towards optimal patient surveillance, providing continuous data to allow for early detection and treatment of patient deterioration. However, as wearable monitors become more widely adopted in healthcare, there is a corresponding need to carefully design the implementation of these tools to promote their integration into clinical workflows and defend against potential misuse and patient harm. Prior to the roll-out of these monitors, our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, clinical engineers, information technologists and research investigators conducted a modified Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA), a proactive evaluation of potential problems which could be encountered in the use of a wireless vital signs monitoring system. This evaluation was accomplished by focussing on the identification of procedures and actions that would be required during the devices' regular usage, as well as the implementation of the system as a comprehensive process. Using this method, the team identified challenges that would arise throughout the lifecycle of the device and developed recommendations to address them. This proactive risk assessment can guide the implementation of wearable patient monitors, optimising the use of innovative health information technology.",2
127,Preferred Placement and Usability of a Smart Textile System vs. Inertial Measurement Units for Activity Monitoring,"Wearable sensors and systems have become increasingly popular in recent years. Two prominent wearable technologies for human activity monitoring are smart textile systems (STSs) and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Despite ongoing advances in both, the usability aspects of these devices require further investigation, especially to facilitate future use. In this study, 18 participants evaluate the preferred placement and usability of two STSs, along with a comparison to a commercial IMU system. These evaluations are completed after participants engaged in a range of activities (e.g., sitting, standing, walking, and running), during which they wear two representatives of smart textile systems: (1) a custom smart undershirt (SUS) and commercial smart socks; and (2) a commercial whole-body IMU system. We first analyze responses regarding the usability of the STS, and subsequently compared these results to those for the IMU system. Participants identify a short-sleeved shirt as their preferred activity monitor. In additional, the SUS in combination with the smart socks is rated superior to the IMU system in several aspects of usability. As reported herein, STSs show promise for future applications in human activity monitoring in terms of usability.",0
128,Acceptance of Commercially Available Wearable Activity Trackers Among Adults Aged Over 50 and With Chronic Illness: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation,"Background:
        
      
      Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increase the risk of chronic illness and death. The newest generation of ""wearable"" activity trackers offers potential as a multifaceted intervention to help people become more active.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To examine the usability and usefulness of wearable activity trackers for older adults living with chronic illness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We recruited a purposive sample of 32 participants over the age of 50, who had been previously diagnosed with a chronic illness, including vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Participants were between 52 and 84 years of age (mean 64); among the study participants, 23 (72%) were women and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m(2). Participants tested 5 trackers, including a simple pedometer (Sportline or Mio) followed by 4 wearable activity trackers (Fitbit Zip, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up 24, and Withings Pulse) in random order. Selected devices represented the range of wearable products and features available on the Canadian market in 2014. Participants wore each device for at least 3 days and evaluated it using a questionnaire developed from the Technology Acceptance Model. We used focus groups to explore participant experiences and a thematic analysis approach to data collection and analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our study resulted in 4 themes: (1) adoption within a comfort zone; (2) self-awareness and goal setting; (3) purposes of data tracking; and (4) future of wearable activity trackers as health care devices. Prior to enrolling, few participants were aware of wearable activity trackers. Most also had been asked by a physician to exercise more and cited this as a motivation for testing the devices. None of the participants planned to purchase the simple pedometer after the study, citing poor accuracy and data loss, whereas 73% (N=32) planned to purchase a wearable activity tracker. Preferences varied but 50% felt they would buy a Fitbit and 42% felt they would buy a Misfit, Jawbone, or Withings. The simple pedometer had a mean acceptance score of 56/95 compared with 63 for the Withings, 65 for the Misfit and Jawbone, and 68 for the Fitbit. To improve usability, older users may benefit from devices that have better compatibility with personal computers or less-expensive Android mobile phones and tablets, and have comprehensive paper-based user manuals and apps that interpret user data.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      For older adults living with chronic illness, wearable activity trackers are perceived as useful and acceptable. New users may need support to both set up the device and learn how to interpret their data.",3
129,An Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Mobile App for Data Collection in Type A Hemophilia: Design and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      There is currently limited evidence on the level and intensity of physical activity in individuals with hemophilia A. Mobile technologies can offer a rigorous and reliable alternative to support data collection processes but they are often associated with poor user retention. The lack of longitudinal continuity in their use can be partly attributed to the insufficient consideration of stakeholder inputs in the development process of mobile apps. Several user-centered models have been proposed to guarantee that a thorough knowledge of the end user needs is considered in the development process of mobile apps.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to design and validate an electronic patient-reported outcome mobile app that requires sustained active input by individuals during POWER, an observational study that aims at evaluating the relationship between physical activity levels and bleeding in patients with hemophilia A.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We adopted a user-centered design and engaged several stakeholders in the development and usability testing of this mobile app. During the concept generation and ideation phase, we organized a need-assessment focus group (FG) with patient representatives to elicit specific design requirements for the end users. We then conducted 2 exploratory FGs to seek additional inputs for the app's improvement and 2 confirmatory FGs to validate the app and test its usability in the field through the mobile health app usability questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The findings from the thematic analysis of the need-assessment FG revealed that there was a demand for sense making, for simplification of app functionalities, for maximizing integration, and for minimizing the feeling of external control. Participants involved in the later stages of the design refinement contributed to improving the design further by upgrading the app's layout and making the experience with the app more efficient through functions such as chatbots and visual feedback on the number of hours a wearable device had been worn, to ensure that the observed data were actually registered. The end users rated the app highly during the quantitative assessment, with an average mobile health app usability questionnaire score of 5.32 (SD 0.66; range 4.44-6.23) and 6.20 (SD 0.43; range 5.72-6.88) out of 7 in the 2 iterative usability testing cycles.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of the usability test indicated a high, growing satisfaction with the electronic patient-reported outcome app. The adoption of a thorough user-centered design process using several types of FGs helped maximize the likelihood of sustained retention of the app's users and made it fit for data collection of relevant outcomes in the observational POWER study. The continuous use of the app and the actual level of engagement will be evaluated during the ongoing trial.

130,Wearable ultrasonic guiding device with white cane for the visually impaired: A preliminary verisimilitude experiment,"Several assistive technologies are available to help visually impaired individuals avoid obstructions while walking. Unfortunately, white canes and medical walkers are unable to detect obstacles on the road or react to encumbrances located above the waist. In this study, I adopted the cyber-physical system approach in the development of a cap-connected device to compensate for gaps in detection associated with conventional aids for the visually impaired. I developed a verisimilar, experimental route involving the participation of seven individuals with visual impairment, including straight sections, left turns, right turns, curves, and suspended objects. My aim was to facilitate the collection of information required for the practical use of the device. My findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed guiding device in alerting walkers to the presence of some kinds of obstacles from the small number of subjects. That is, it shows promise for future work and research with the proposed device. My findings provide a valuable reference for the further improvement of these devices as well as the establishment of experiments involving the visually impaired.",2
131,Clinician Perspectives on the Design and Application of Wearable Cardiac Technologies for Older Adults: Qualitative Study,"Background:
        
      
      New wearable devices (for example, AliveCor or Zio patch) offer promise in detecting arrhythmia and monitoring cardiac health status, among other clinically useful parameters in older adults. However, the clinical utility and usability from the perspectives of clinicians is largely unexplored.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore clinician perspectives on the use of wearable cardiac monitoring technology for older adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A descriptive qualitative study was conducted using semistructured focus group interviews. Clinicians were recruited through purposive sampling of physicians, nurses, and allied health staff working in 3 tertiary-level hospitals. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis to identify themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Clinicians representing physicians, nurses, and allied health staff working in 3 tertiary-level hospitals completed 4 focus group interviews between May 2019 and July 2019. There were 50 participants (28 men and 22 women), including cardiologists, geriatricians, nurses, and allied health staff. The focus groups generated the following 3 overarching, interrelated themes: (1) the current state of play, understanding the perceived challenges of patient cardiac monitoring in hospitals, (2) priorities in cardiac monitoring, what parameters new technologies should measure, and (3) cardiac monitoring of the future, ""the ideal device.""
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There remain pitfalls related to the design of wearable cardiac technology for older adults that present clinical challenges. These pitfalls and challenges likely negatively impact the uptake of wearable cardiac monitoring in routine clinical care. Partnering with clinicians and patients in the co-design of new wearable cardiac monitoring technologies is critical to optimize the use of these devices and their uptake in clinical care.",2
132,End-user and clinician perspectives on the viability of wearable functional electrical stimulation garments after stroke and spinal cord injury,"Purpose:
        
      
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES), through repetitive training (FES-therapy) or continuous assistance (neuro-prosthesis), can restore motor function after paralysis due to spinal cord injury or stroke. With current technology, patients are often incapable of independently applying FES, thereby limiting its use. Novel FES-garments with embedded stimulation electrodes were developed in collaboration with Myant, Canada, to address this problem. The purpose of this study was to collect the views of future end-users to inform the refinement of the device design and to obtain insights on subsequent commercialization of this rehabilitation and assistive technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A qualitative study was undertaken to determine the needs of potential users (patients and clinicians; n = 19). Participant took part in interviews or focus groups after a presentation of the garments. An inductive content analysis was used to generate the themes from the data and identify data saturation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The identified themes and sub-themes were: (1) User Perspectives: users' characteristics (needs, limitations), expected benefits (beliefs), and anticipated problems (fears); (2) Device Design: technical features, usability, and disadvantages of the garment, cables, stimulator, software, and interface; (3) Acquisition Process: organizational procedures (acquisition and adoption steps); and (4) Business Model: financial and strategic aspects to facilitate commercialization and support users.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The insights obtained from end-users and clinicians provide guidelines to optimize the development of novel FES-garments, and strategies for bringing the device to the market. The themes identified can serve to inform other rehabilitation and assistive technology developers with processes and ideas on how to meet these groups' needs.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONParticipants with neurological paralysis have interest and critical views on new rehabilitation and assistive technology, and the repercussions of using new technologies to address their function, health and wellbeing.The FES-garment design presented appeared acceptable to the end-users, pending resolution of certain shortcomings (wiring, operating duration, robustness, easiness to don and doff).End-users and clinicians had specific views regarding the acquisition process of new technologies (training, customization, and follow-up/support), which are important to take into consideration to ensure broad stakeholders uptake.",3
133,Realization and Technology Acceptance Test of a Wearable Cardiac Health Monitoring and Early Warning System with Multi-Channel MCGs and ECG,"In this work, a wearable smart clothing system for cardiac health monitoring with a multi-channel mechanocardiogram (MCG) has been developed to predict the myo-cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) function and to provide early risk warnings to the subjects. In this paper, the realization of the core of this system, i.e., the Cardiac Health Assessment and Monitoring Platform (CHAMP), with respect to its hardware, firmware, and wireless design features, is presented. The feature values from the CHAMP system have been correlated with myo-cardiac functions obtained from actual heart failure (HF) patients.

      Currently, assessment of symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease is mainly performed in the clinic. However, these assessments have limitations because they provide only a snapshot of the condition.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The feasibility and usability of an objective, continuous and relatively unobtrusive system (SENSE-PARK System), which consists of wearable sensors (three worn during the day and one worn at night), a smartphone-based App, a balance board and computer software, was tested 24/7 over 12 weeks in a study including 22 PD patients. During the first four weeks of the study, patients did not get feedback about their performance, during the last eight weeks they did. The study included seven clinical visits with standardized interviews, and regular phone contact. The primary outcome was the number of drop-outs during the study. As secondary outcomes, the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ), score and information obtained from the standardized interviews were used to evaluate the usability of the system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients completed the study. The participants rated the usability of the SENSE-PARK System with a mean score of 2.67 (±0.49) on the PSSUQ. The interviews revealed that most participants liked using the system and appreciated that it signaled changes in their health condition.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This 12 week controlled study demonstrates that the acceptance level of PD patients using the SENSE-PARK System as a home-based 24/7 assessment is very good. Particular emphasis should be given to a user-friendly design. Motivation to wear such a system can be increased by providing direct feedback about the individual health condition.",6
135,Feasibility of a wearable soft-robotic glove to support impaired hand function in stroke patients,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the feasibility of a wear-able, soft-robotic glove system developed to combine assistive support in daily life with performing therapeutic exercises on a computer at home (the HandinMind system).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Feasibility study.
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Five chronic stroke patients with limitations in activities of daily living due to impaired hand function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants performed a usability test and several functional tasks with the HandinMind system across 2 sessions. Feasibility was measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS), Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) and performance times of the functional tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      User acceptance measured by the SUS and IMI was scored high. The median SUS scores of sessions 1 and 2 were 80.0 (interquartile range (IQR) 70.0-88.8) and 77.5 (IQR 75.0-87.5), respectively, and the median IMI score was 6.3 points out of 7 points (IQR 6.2-6.3). Functional task performance was initially slower with the HandinMind glove compared with performance without the glove, but improved up to the level of performance without the glove across no more than 3 repetitions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Chronic stroke patients with impaired hand function were positive about the feasibility of the first prototype of the HandinMind system. How-ever, performance and ease of use of the system should be improved further in future development phases.",5
136,IMU-based assistance modulation in upper limb soft wearable exosuits,"Soft exosuits have advantages over their rigid counterparts in terms of portability, transparency and ergonomics. Our previous work has shown that a soft, fabric-based exosuit, actuated by an electric motor and a Bowden cable, reduced the muscular effort of the user when flexing the elbow. This previous exosuit used a gravity compensation algorithm with the assumption that the shoulder was adducted at the trunk. In this investigation, the shoulder elevation angle was incorporated into the gravity compensation control via inertial measurement units (IMUs). We assessed our updated gravity compensation model with four healthy, male subjects (age: $26.2 \pm 1.19$ years) who followed an elbow flexion reference trajectory which reached three amplitudes $(25^{\circ}, 50^{\circ}, 75^{\circ})$ and was repeated at three shoulder angles $(25^{\circ}, 50^{\circ}, 75^{\circ})$. To assess the performance of the exosuit; the smoothness, tracking accuracy and muscle activity were investigated during each motion. We found a reduction of biceps brachii activation (24.3%) in the powered condition compared to the unpowered condition. In addition, there was an improvement in kinematic smoothness (0.83%) and a reduction of tracking accuracy (26.5%) in the powered condition with respect to the unpowered condition. We can conclude that the updated gravity compensation algorithm has increased the number of supported movements by considering the shoulder elevation, which has improved the usability of the device.",0
137,Continuous Monitoring of Vital Signs in the General Ward Using Wearable Devices: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable devices can be used for continuous patient monitoring in the general ward, increasing patient safety. Little is known about the experiences and expectations of patients and health care professionals regarding continuous monitoring with these devices.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to identify positive and negative effects as well as barriers and facilitators for the use of two wearable devices: ViSi Mobile (VM) and HealthPatch (HP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this randomized controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using VM or HP and a control group. Users' experiences and expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews. Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Psychological distress was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both devices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. We identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19 facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP. Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM lines and electrodes. No differences related to psychological distress and usability were found between randomization groups or devices.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both devices were well received by most patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in the general ward. This comprehensive overview of barriers and facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for future researchers, developers, and health care institutions that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward.

138,Assessment of feedback modalities for wearable visual aids in blind mobility,"Sensory substitution devices engage sensory modalities other than vision to communicate information typically obtained through the sense of sight. In this paper, we examine the ability of subjects who are blind to follow simple verbal and vibrotactile commands that allow them to navigate a complex path. A total of eleven visually impaired subjects were enrolled in the study. Prototype systems were developed to deliver verbal and vibrotactile commands to allow an investigator to guide a subject through a course. Using this mode, subjects could follow commands easily and navigate significantly faster than with their cane alone (p <0.05). The feedback modes were similar with respect to the increased speed for course completion. Subjects rated usability of the feedback systems as ""above average"" with scores of 76.3 and 90.9 on the system usability scale.",3
139,Evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks as a Method of EEG-EMG Fusion,"Wearable robotic exoskeletons have emerged as an exciting new treatment tool for disorders affecting mobility; however, the human-machine interface, used by the patient for device control, requires further improvement before robotic assistance and rehabilitation can be widely adopted. One method, made possible through advancements in machine learning technology, is the use of bioelectrical signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), to classify the user's actions and intentions. While classification using these signals has been demonstrated for many relevant control tasks, such as motion intention detection and gesture recognition, challenges in decoding the bioelectrical signals have caused researchers to seek methods for improving the accuracy of these models. One such method is the use of EEG-EMG fusion, creating a classification model that decodes information from both EEG and EMG signals simultaneously to increase the amount of available information. So far, EEG-EMG fusion has been implemented using traditional machine learning methods that rely on manual feature extraction; however, new machine learning methods have emerged that can automatically extract relevant information from a dataset, which may prove beneficial during EEG-EMG fusion. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed using combined EEG-EMG inputs to determine if they have potential as a method of EEG-EMG fusion that automatically extracts relevant information from both signals simultaneously. EEG and EMG signals were recorded during elbow flexion-extension and used to develop CNN models based on time-frequency (spectrogram) and time (filtered signal) domain image inputs. The results show a mean accuracy of 80.51 ± 8.07% for a three-class output (33.33% chance level), with an F-score of 80.74%, using time-frequency domain-based models. This work demonstrates the viability of CNNs as a new method of EEG-EMG fusion and evaluates different signal representations to determine the best implementation of a combined EEG-EMG CNN. It leverages modern machine learning methods to advance EEG-EMG fusion, which will ultimately lead to improvements in the usability of wearable robotic exoskeletons.",3
140,Wearable Biofeedback Improves Human-Robot Compliance during Ankle-Foot Exoskeleton-Assisted Gait Training: A Pre-Post Controlled Study in Healthy Participants,"The adjunctive use of biofeedback systems with exoskeletons may accelerate post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Wearable patient-oriented human-robot interaction-based biofeedback is proposed to improve patient-exoskeleton compliance regarding the interaction torque's direction (joint motion strategy) and magnitude (user participation strategy) through auditory and vibrotactile cues during assisted gait training, respectively. Parallel physiotherapist-oriented strategies are also proposed such that physiotherapists can follow in real-time a patient's motor performance towards effective involvement during training. A preliminary pre-post controlled study was conducted with eight healthy participants to conclude about the biofeedback's efficacy during gait training driven by an ankle-foot exoskeleton and guided by a technical person. For the study group, performance related to the interaction torque's direction increased during (p-value = 0.07) and after (p-value = 0.07) joint motion training. Further, the performance regarding the interaction torque's magnitude significantly increased during (p-value = 0.03) and after (p-value = 68.59×10-3) user participation training. The experimental group and a technical person reported promising usability of the biofeedback and highlighted the importance of the timely cues from physiotherapist-oriented strategies. Less significant improvements in patient-exoskeleton compliance were observed in the control group. The overall findings suggest that the proposed biofeedback was able to improve the participant-exoskeleton compliance by enhancing human-robot interaction; thus, it may be a powerful tool to accelerate post-stroke ankle-foot deformity recovery.",3
141,Systematic review on the application of wearable inertial sensors to quantify everyday life motor activity in people with mobility impairments,"Background:
        
      
      Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies enable objective and long-term monitoring of motor activities in a patient's habitual environment. People with mobility impairments require appropriate data processing algorithms that deal with their altered movement patterns and determine clinically meaningful outcome measures. Over the years, a large variety of algorithms have been published and this review provides an overview of their outcome measures, the concepts of the algorithms, the type and placement of required sensors as well as the investigated patient populations and measurement properties.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS in October 2019. The search strategy was designed to identify studies that (1) involved people with mobility impairments, (2) used wearable inertial sensors, (3) provided a description of the underlying algorithm, and (4) quantified an aspect of everyday life motor activity. The two review authors independently screened the search hits for eligibility and conducted the data extraction for the narrative review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-five studies were included in this review. They covered a large variety of outcome measures and algorithms which can be grouped into four categories: (1) maintaining and changing a body position, (2) walking and moving, (3) moving around using a wheelchair, and (4) activities that involve the upper extremity. The validity or reproducibility of these outcomes measures was investigated in fourteen different patient populations. Most of the studies evaluated the algorithm's accuracy to detect certain activities in unlabeled raw data. The type and placement of required sensor technologies depends on the activity and outcome measure and are thoroughly described in this review. The usability of the applied sensor setups was rarely reported.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of applications of wearable inertial sensors to quantify everyday life motor activity in people with mobility impairments. It summarizes the state-of-the-art, it provides quick access to the relevant literature, and it enables the identification of gaps for the evaluation of existing and the development of new algorithms.",1
142,The Digital Health Revolution and People with Disabilities: Perspective from the United States,"This article serves as the introduction to this special issue on Mobile Health and Mobile Rehabilitation for People with Disabilities. Social, technological and policy trends are reviewed. Needs, opportunities and challenges for the emerging fields of mobile health (mHealth, aka eHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab) are discussed. Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others. Furthermore, technologies that enable mRehab (wearable sensors, in-home environmental monitors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence) transcend national boundaries. Remote and mobile healthcare delivery is needed and inevitable. Proactive engagement is critical to ensure acceptance and effectiveness for all stakeholders.",2
143,"Satisfaction, Usability, and Compliance With the Use of Smartwatches for Ecological Momentary Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Symptoms in Older Adults: Usability Study","Background:
        
      
      Smartwatches enable physicians to monitor symptoms in patients with knee osteoarthritis, their behavior, and their environment. Older adults experience fluctuations in their pain and related symptoms (mood, fatigue, and sleep quality) that smartwatches are ideally suited to capture remotely in a convenient manner.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate satisfaction, usability, and compliance using the real-time, online assessment and mobility monitoring (ROAMM) mobile app designed for smartwatches for individuals with knee osteoarthritis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants (N=28; mean age 73.2, SD 5.5 years; 70% female) with reported knee osteoarthritis were asked to wear a smartwatch with the ROAMM app installed. They were prompted to report their prior night's sleep quality in the morning, followed by ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of their pain, fatigue, mood, and activity in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Satisfaction, comfort, and usability were evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. Compliance with regard to answering EMAs was calculated after excluding time when the watch was not being worn for technical reasons (eg, while charging).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A majority of participants reported that the text displayed was large enough to read (22/26, 85%), and all participants found it easy to enter ratings using the smartwatch. Approximately half of the participants found the smartwatch to be comfortable (14/26, 54%) and would consider wearing it as their personal watch (11/24, 46%). Most participants were satisfied with its battery charging system (20/26, 77%). A majority of participants (19/26, 73%) expressed their willingness to use the ROAMM app for a 1-year research study. The overall EMA compliance rate was 83% (2505/3036 responses). The compliance rate was lower among those not regularly wearing a wristwatch (10/26, 88% vs 16/26, 71%) and among those who found the text too small to read (4/26, 86% vs 22/26, 60%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Older adults with knee osteoarthritis positively rated the ROAMM smartwatch app and were generally satisfied with the device. The high compliance rates coupled with the willingness to participate in a long-term study suggest that the ROAMM app is a viable approach to remotely collecting health symptoms and behaviors for both research and clinical endeavors.",6
144,"Intention Detection Strategies for Robotic Upper-Limb Orthoses: A Scoping Review Considering Usability, Daily Life Application, and User Evaluation","Wearable robotic upper limb orthoses (ULO) are promising tools to assist or enhance the upper-limb function of their users. While the functionality of these devices has continuously increased, the robust and reliable detection of the user's intention to control the available degrees of freedom remains a major challenge and a barrier for acceptance. As the information interface between device and user, the intention detection strategy (IDS) has a crucial impact on the usability of the overall device. Yet, this aspect and the impact it has on the device usability is only rarely evaluated with respect to the context of use of ULO. A scoping literature review was conducted to identify non-invasive IDS applied to ULO that have been evaluated with human participants, with a specific focus on evaluation methods and findings related to functionality and usability and their appropriateness for specific contexts of use in daily life. A total of 93 studies were identified, describing 29 different IDS that are summarized and classified according to a four-level classification scheme. The predominant user input signal associated with the described IDS was electromyography (35.6%), followed by manual triggers such as buttons, touchscreens or joysticks (16.7%), as well as isometric force generated by residual movement in upper-limb segments (15.1%). We identify and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of IDS with respect to specific contexts of use and highlight a trade-off between performance and complexity in selecting an optimal IDS. Investigating evaluation practices to study the usability of IDS, the included studies revealed that, primarily, objective and quantitative usability attributes related to effectiveness or efficiency were assessed. Further, it underlined the lack of a systematic way to determine whether the usability of an IDS is sufficiently high to be appropriate for use in daily life applications. This work highlights the importance of a user- and application-specific selection and evaluation of non-invasive IDS for ULO. For technology developers in the field, it further provides recommendations on the selection process of IDS as well as to the design of corresponding evaluation protocols.",0
145,Accuracy and usability of AcuPebble SA100 for automated diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea in the home environment setting: an evaluation study,"Objectives:
        
      
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a heavily underdiagnosed condition, which can lead to significant multimorbidity. Underdiagnosis is often secondary to limitations in existing diagnostic methods. We conducted a diagnostic accuracy and usability study, to evaluate the efficacy of a novel, low-cost, small, wearable medical device, AcuPebble_SA100, for automated diagnosis of OSA in the home environment.
    


          Settings:
        
      
      Patients were recruited to a standard OSA diagnostic pathway in an UK hospital. They were trained on the use of type-III-cardiorespiratory polygraphy, which they took to use at home. They were also given AcuPebble_SA100; but they were not trained on how to use it.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      182 consecutive patients had been referred for OSA diagnosis in which 150 successfully completed the study.
    


          Primary outcome measures:
        
      
      Efficacy of AcuPebble_SA100 for automated diagnosis of moderate-severe-OSA against cardiorespiratory polygraphy (sensitivity/specificity/likelihood ratios/predictive values) and validation of usability by patients themselves in their home environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After returning the systems, two expert clinicians, blinded to AcuPebble_SA100's output, manually scored the cardiorespiratory polygraphy signals to reach a diagnosis. AcuPebble_SA100 generated automated diagnosis corresponding to four, typically followed, diagnostic criteria: Apnoea Hypopnoea Index (AHI) using 3% as criteria for oxygen desaturation; Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) for 3% and 4% desaturation criteria and AHI using 4% as desaturation criteria. In all cases, AcuPebble_SA100 matched the experts' diagnosis with positive and negative likelihood ratios over 10 and below 0.1, respectively. Comparing against the current American Academy of Sleep Medicine's AHI-based criteria demonstrated 95.33% accuracy (95% CI (90·62% to 98·10%)), 96.84% specificity (95% CI (91·05% to 99·34%)), 92.73% sensitivity (95% CI (82·41% to 97·98%)), 94.4% positive-predictive value (95% CI (84·78% to 98·11%)) and 95.83% negative-predictive value (95% CI (89·94% to 98·34%)). All patients used AcuPebble_SA100 correctly. Over 97% reported a strong preference for AcuPebble_SA100 over cardiorespiratory polygraphy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results validate the efficacy of AcuPebble_SA100 as an automated diagnosis alternative to cardiorespiratory polygraphy; also demonstrating that AcuPebble_SA100 can be used by patients without requiring human training/assistance. This opens the doors for more efficient patient pathways for OSA diagnosis.

146,Interactive wearable systems for upper body rehabilitation: a systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      The development of interactive rehabilitation technologies which rely on wearable-sensing for upper body rehabilitation is attracting increasing research interest. This paper reviews related research with the aim: 1) To inventory and classify interactive wearable systems for movement and posture monitoring during upper body rehabilitation, regarding the sensing technology, system measurements and feedback conditions; 2) To gauge the wearability of the wearable systems; 3) To inventory the availability of clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of related technologies.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted in the following search engines: PubMed, ACM, Scopus and IEEE (January 2010-April 2016).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-five papers were included and discussed in a new cuboid taxonomy which consists of 3 dimensions: sensing technology, feedback modalities and system measurements. Wearable sensor systems were developed for persons in: 1) Neuro-rehabilitation: stroke (n = 21), spinal cord injury (n = 1), cerebral palsy (n = 2), Alzheimer (n = 1); 2) Musculoskeletal impairment: ligament rehabilitation (n = 1), arthritis (n = 1), frozen shoulder (n = 1), bones trauma (n = 1); 3) Others: chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (n = 1), chronic pain rehabilitation (n = 1) and other general rehabilitation (n = 14). Accelerometers and inertial measurement units (IMU) are the most frequently used technologies (84% of the papers). They are mostly used in multiple sensor configurations to measure upper limb kinematics and/or trunk posture. Sensors are placed mostly on the trunk, upper arm, the forearm, the wrist, and the finger. Typically sensors are attachable rather than embedded in wearable devices and garments; although studies that embed and integrate sensors are increasing in the last 4 years. 16 studies applied knowledge of result (KR) feedback, 14 studies applied knowledge of performance (KP) feedback and 15 studies applied both in various modalities. 16 studies have conducted their evaluation with patients and reported usability tests, while only three of them conducted clinical trials including one randomized clinical trial.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review has shown that wearable systems are used mostly for the monitoring and provision of feedback on posture and upper extremity movements in stroke rehabilitation. The results indicated that accelerometers and IMUs are the most frequently used sensors, in most cases attached to the body through ad hoc contraptions for the purpose of improving range of motion and movement performance during upper body rehabilitation. Systems featuring sensors embedded in wearable appliances or garments are only beginning to emerge. Similarly, clinical evaluations are scarce and are further needed to provide evidence on effectiveness and pave the path towards implementation in clinical settings.",3
147,Investigating the Overall Experience of Wearable Robots during Prototype-Stage Testing,"Wearable robots (WRs) might interact with humans in a similar manner to teammates to accomplish specific tasks together. However, the available data on WR user experience (UX) studies are limited, especially during the prototyping phase. Therefore, this study aims to examine the overall experience of WRs during the prototyping phase based on an exploratory research model. This theoretical model considered usability, hedonic quality, and attitude toward using WRs as key factors in explaining and predicting overall experience. To test the hypotheses inherent in the research model, quantitative empirical research was conducted and the data were analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results from the PLS-SEM analysis revealed the significance level of correlations between the latent variables in the research model. The exploratory research model was able to explain up to 53.2% of the variance in the overall experience of using WRs, indicating medium predictive power. This research develops a new quantitative empirical research model that can be used to explain and predict the overall experience of interactive products such as WRs. Meanwhile, the model is needed during WR testing in the prototype phase.",3
148,Modulation Spectral Signal Representation for Quality Measurement and Enhancement of Wearable Device Data: A Technical Note,"Wearable devices are burgeoning, and applications across numerous verticals are emerging, including human performance monitoring, at-home patient monitoring, and health tracking, to name a few. Off-the-shelf wearables have been developed with focus on portability, usability, and low-cost. As such, when deployed in highly ecological settings, wearable data can be corrupted by artifacts and by missing data, thus severely hampering performance. In this technical note, we overview a signal processing representation called the modulation spectrum. The representation quantifies the rate-of-change of different spectral magnitude components and is shown to separate signal from noise, thus allowing for improved quality measurement, quality enhancement, and noise-robust feature extraction, as well as for disease characterization. We provide an overview of numerous applications developed by the authors over the last decade spanning different wearable modalities and list the results obtained from experimental results alongside comparisons with various state-of-the-art benchmark methods. Open-source software is showcased with the hope that new applications can be developed. We conclude with a discussion on possible future research directions, such as context awareness, signal compression, and improved input representations for deep learning algorithms.",4
149,Feasibility of large-scale deployment of multiple wearable sensors in Parkinson's disease,"Wearable devices can capture objective day-to-day data about Parkinson's Disease (PD). This study aims to assess the feasibility of implementing wearable technology to collect data from multiple sensors during the daily lives of PD patients. The Parkinson@home study is an observational, two-cohort (North America, NAM; The Netherlands, NL) study. To recruit participants, different strategies were used between sites. Main enrolment criteria were self-reported diagnosis of PD, possession of a smartphone and age≥18 years. Participants used the Fox Wearable Companion app on a smartwatch and smartphone for a minimum of 6 weeks (NAM) or 13 weeks (NL). Sensor-derived measures estimated information about movement. Additionally, medication intake and symptoms were collected via self-reports in the app. A total of 953 participants were included (NL: 304, NAM: 649). Enrolment rate was 88% in the NL (n = 304) and 51% (n = 649) in NAM. Overall, 84% (n = 805) of participants contributed sensor data. Participants were compliant for 68% (16.3 hours/participant/day) of the study period in NL and for 62% (14.8 hours/participant/day) in NAM. Daily accelerometer data collection decreased 23% in the NL after 13 weeks, and 27% in NAM after 6 weeks. Data contribution was not affected by demographics, clinical characteristics or attitude towards technology, but was by the platform usability score in the NL (χ2 (2) = 32.014, p<0.001), and self-reported depression in NAM (χ2(2) = 6.397, p = .04). The Parkinson@home study shows that it is feasible to collect objective data using multiple wearable sensors in PD during daily life in a large cohort.",6

      Caregiver burden associated with dementia-related agitation is one of the most common reasons for a community-dwelling person living with dementia to transition to a care facility. The Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention (BESI) for the Dementia Caregiver Empowerment system uses sensing technology, smartwatches, tablets, and data analytics to detect and predict agitation in persons living with dementia and to provide just-in-time notifications and dyad-specific intervention recommendations to caregivers. The BESI system has shown that there is a valid relationship between dementia-related agitation and environmental factors and that caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to obtain input from caregivers of persons living with dementia on the value, usability, and acceptability of the BESI system in the home setting and obtain their insights and recommendations for the next stage of system development.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A descriptive qualitative design with thematic analysis was used to analyze 10 semistructured interviews with caregivers. The interviews comprised 16 questions, with an 80% (128/160) response rate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Postdeployment caregiver feedback about the BESI system and the overall experience were generally positive. Caregivers acknowledged the acceptability of the system by noting the ease of use and saw the system as a fit for them. Functionality issues such as timeliness in agitation notification and simplicity in the selection of agitation descriptors on the tablet interface were identified, and caregivers indicated a desire for more word options to describe agitation behaviors. Agitation intervention suggestions were well received by the caregivers, and the resulting decrease in the number and severity of agitation events helped confirm that the BESI system has good value and acceptability. Thematic analysis suggested several subjective experiences and yielded the themes of usefulness and helpfulness.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study determined preferences for assessing caregiver strain and burden, explored caregiver acceptance of the technology system (in-home sensors, actigraph or smart watch technology, and tablet devices), discerned caregiver insights on the burden and stress of caring for persons living with dementia experiencing agitation in dementia, and solicited caregiver input and recommendations for system changes. The themes of usefulness and helpfulness support the use of caregiver knowledge and experience to inform further development of the technology.",4
152,Prototyping Mobile Storytelling Applications for People with Aphasia,"Aphasia is a partial or total loss of the ability to articulate ideas or comprehend spoken language, resulting from brain damage, in a person whose language skills were previously normal. Our goal was to find out how a storytelling app can help people with aphasia to communicate and share daily experiences. For this purpose, the Aphasia Create app was created for tablets, along with Aphastory for the Google Glass device. These applications facilitate social participation and enhance quality of life by using visual storytelling forms composed of photos, drawings, icons, etc., that can be saved and shared. We performed usability tests (supervised by a neuropsychologist) on six participants with aphasia who were able to communicate. Our work contributes (1) evidence that the functions implemented in the Aphasia Create tablet app suit the needs of target users, but older people are often not familiar with tactile devices, (2) reports that the Google Glass device may be problematic for persons with right-hand paresis, and (3) a characterization of the design guidelines for apps for aphasics. Both applications can be used to work with people with aphasia, and can be further developed. Aphasic centers, in which the apps were presented, expressed interest in using them to work with patients. The Aphasia Create app won the Enactus Poland National Competition in 2015.",3
153,"A Protocol to Assess Feasibility, Acceptability, and Usability of Mobile Technology for Symptom Management in Pediatric Transplant Patients","Background:
        
      
      Pediatric blood and marrow transplant (PBMT) patients experience significant symptom distress, and the use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies may enhance symptom management by providing patient-generated health data to foster personalized health strategies.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to present a study protocol to explore feasibility, acceptability, and usability of integrating mHealth technologies to collect and monitor symptom data for PBMT patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An exploratory mixed-methods design is employed for 20 PBMT patients to monitor symptoms using real-time data from two mHealth devices: (a) a self-developed mHealth application and (b) a wearable tracking device. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System surveys for fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance are obtained monthly. Interviews are conducted to obtain further feasibility and usability data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study began in October 2017; data collection should be completed in 2018. Feasibility and usability results to monitor and record symptom-related data daily via mobile devices will be reported. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System surveys and interviews will further explore patients' symptoms and experiences with the mobile devices.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study will be among the first to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of integrating multiple mHealth technologies to obtain patient-generated symptom data for the PBMT population. Results will enhance our understanding of how these data present, interact, and cluster together throughout the posttransplant period for these children and lead to symptom management strategies. Results will focus on a high-risk population that potentially stands to benefit from the use of mobile technologies.",6
154,Allumo: Preprocessing and Calibration Software for Wearable Accelerometers Used in Posture Tracking,"Inertial measurement units have recently shown great potential for the accurate measurement of joint angle movements in replacement of motion capture systems. In the race towards long duration tracking, inertial measurement units increasingly aim to ensure portability and long battery life, allowing improved ecological studies. Their main advantage over laboratory grade equipment is their usability in a wider range of environment for greater ecological value. For accurate and useful measurements, these types of sensors require a robust orientation estimation that remains accurate over long periods of time. To this end, we developed the Allumo software for the preprocessing and calibration of the orientation estimate of triaxial accelerometers. This software has an automatic orientation calibration procedure, an automatic erroneous orientation-estimate detection and useful visualization to help process long and short measurement periods. These automatic procedures are detailed in this paper, and two case studies are presented to showcase the usefulness of the software. The Allumo software is open-source and available online.",7
155,Usability and Acceptance of Wearable Biosensors in Forensic Psychiatry: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study,"Background:
        
      
      The use of wearable biosensor devices for monitoring and coaching in forensic psychiatric settings yields high expectations for improved self-regulation of emotions and behavior in clients and staff members. More so, if clients have mild intellectual disabilities (IQ 50-85), they might benefit from these biosensors as they are easy to use in everyday life, which ensures that clients can practice with the devices in multiple stress and arousal-inducing situations. However, research on (continuous) use and acceptance of biosensors in forensic psychiatry for clients with mild intellectual disabilities and their caretakers is scarce. Although wearable biosensors show promise for health care, recent research showed that the acceptance and continuous use of wearable devices in consumers is not as was anticipated, probably due to low expectations.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The main goal of this study was to investigate the associations between and determinants of the expectation of usability, the actual experienced usability, and the intention for continuous use of biosensors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 77 participants (31 forensic clients with mild intellectual disabilities and 46 forensic staff members) participated in a 1-week trial. Preceding the study, we selected 4 devices thought to benefit the participants in domains of self-regulation, physical health, or sleep. Qualitative and quantitative questionnaires were used that explored the determinants of usability, acceptance, and continuous use of biosensors. Questionnaires consisted of the System Usability Scale, the Technology Acceptance Model questionnaire, and the extended expectation confirmation model questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Only the experienced usability of the devices was associated with intended continuous use. Forensic clients scored higher on acceptance and intention for continuous use than staff members. Moderate associations were found between usability with acceptance and continuous use. Staff members showed stronger associations between usability and acceptance (r=.80, P<.001) and usability and continuous use (r=.79, P<.001) than clients, who showed more moderate correlations between usability and acceptance (r=.46, P=.01) and usability and continuous use (r=.52, P=.003). The qualitative questionnaires in general indicated that the devices were easy to use and gave clear information.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Contrary to expectations, it was the actual perceived usability of wearing a biosensor that was associated with continuous use and to a much lesser extent the expectancy of usability. Clients scored higher on acceptance and intention for continuous use, but associations between usability and both acceptance and continuous use were markedly stronger in staff members. This study provides clear directions on how to further investigate these associations. For example, whether this is a true effect or due to a social desirability bias in the client group must be investigated. Clients with mild intellectual disabilities might benefit from the ease of use of these devices and their continuing monitoring and coaching apps. For these clients, it is especially important to develop easy-to-use biosensors with a minimum requirement on cognitive capacity to increase usability, acceptance, and continuous use.",9
156,Augmenting Critical Care Patient Monitoring Using Wearable Technology: Review of Usability and Human Factors,"Background:
        
      
      Continuous monitoring of the vital signs of critical care patients is an essential component of critical care medicine. For this task, clinicians use a patient monitor (PM), which conveys patient vital sign data through a screen and an auditory alarm system. Some limitations with PMs have been identified in the literature, such as the need for visual contact with the PM screen, which could result in reduced focus on the patient in specific scenarios, and the amount of noise generated by the PM alarm system. With the advancement of material science and electronic technology, wearable devices have emerged as a potential solution for these problems. This review presents the findings of several studies that focused on the usability and human factors of wearable devices designed for use in critical care patient monitoring.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to review the current state of the art in wearable devices intended for use by clinicians to monitor vital signs of critical care patients in hospital settings, with a focus on the usability and human factors of the devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases was conducted, and 20 studies were identified and critically reviewed by the authors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 3 types of wearable devices: tactile, head-mounted, and smartwatch displays. In most cases, these devices were intended for use by anesthesiologists, but nurses and surgeons were also identified as potentially important users of wearable technology in critical care medicine. Although the studies investigating tactile displays revealed their potential to improve clinical monitoring, usability problems related to comfort need to be overcome before they can be considered suitable for use in clinical practice. Only a few studies investigated the usability and human factors of tactile displays by conducting user testing involving critical care professionals. The studies of head-mounted displays (HMDs) revealed that these devices could be useful in critical care medicine, particularly from an ergonomics point of view. By reducing the amount of time the user spends averting their gaze from the patient to a separate screen, HMDs enable clinicians to improve their patient focus and reduce the potential of repetitive strain injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Researchers and designers of new wearable devices for use in critical care medicine should strive to achieve not only enhanced performance but also enhanced user experience for their users, especially in terms of comfort and ease of use. These aspects of wearable displays must be extensively tested with the intended end users in a setting that properly reflects the intended context of use before their adoption can be considered in clinical settings.",2
157,Add-on optical mask to declutter visual information based on depth for visual prostheses,"One of the challenges in retinal and cortical visual prostheses is decluttering the visual information of the scene. Current device use brightness information, therefore, bright faraway targets can dominate the perception and nearby obstacles may be missed. Therefore, the aim is to ensure that visual information of interest is delivered to the implant. To achieve this, it is essential to obtain information regarding the distance of each object in a scene. Owing to limited power requirements, it is problematic to use an active depth sensor such as Lidar, which requires strong illumination. specifically, in outdoor environments. Depth sensors based on stereo imaging require heavy computational resources, which is also problematic in wearable devices. There is a need for simple passive and robust depth sensor. Herein, we demonstrate the usability of an optical mask that can be placed in front of any RGB camera to create a depth sensor. The mask introduces chromatic aberrations and artificially separates the colors by creating pre-defined phase errors that shift the focal plane as a function of the wavelength. We designed and fabricated a mask that, in combination with the lens of the camera, allows each color to be in focus at a different distance. The red channel produces a focused image for objects that are in the near range, the green channel focuses objects at the mid-range, and the blue channel focuses distant objects. Because realistic targets contain radiation at all wavelengths, they appear in focus at the color channel that matches their distance. Finally, a standard deviation image filter is used to extract only the information that is in focus and to convert the color information to depth information. Clinical Relevance-The proposed method can enhance the usability and functionality of current and future visual prostheses, specifically in outdoor environments, by providing depth information using a passive miniature optical device.",3
158,Multifunctional Textile Platform for Fiber Optic Wearable Temperature-Monitoring Application,"Wearable sensing technologies have been developed rapidly in the last decades for physiological and biomechanical signal monitoring. Much attention has been paid to functions of wearable applications, but comfort parameters have been overlooked. This research presents a developed fabric temperature sensor by adopting fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors and processing via a textile platform. This FBG-based quasi-distributed sensing system demonstrated a sensitivity of 10.61 ± 0.08 pm/°C with high stability in various temperature environments. No obvious wavelength shift occurred under the curvatures varying from 0 to 50.48 m-1 and in different integration methods with textiles. The temperature distribution monitored by the developed textile sensor in a complex environment with multiple heat sources was deduced using MATLAB to present a real-time dynamic temperature distribution in the wearing environment. This novel fabric temperature sensor shows high sensitivity, stability, and usability with comfort textile properties that are of great potential in wearable applications.",0
159,Biofeedback Treatment App for Pediatric Migraine: Development and Usability Study,"Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to develop and investigate the usability of a biofeedback treatment smartphone app for adolescent migraine sufferers.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Biofeedback is effective in treating pediatric migraine. However, biofeedback is not widely used due to the necessity of a trained therapist and specialized equipment. Emerging digital technology, including smartphones and wearables, enables new ways of administering biofeedback.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a prospective open-label development and usability study, 10 adolescent migraine sufferers used a newly developed biofeedback app with wearable sensors that measured their muscle tension, finger temperature, and heart rate. Three iterative rounds of usability testing, including a 2-week home testing period, were completed. A biofeedback algorithm, combining and optimizing the 3 physiological modalities, and several algorithms for sham-treatment were created. Usability was evaluated statistically and summarized thematically.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five of ten participants completed all 3 rounds of usability testing. A total of 72 biofeedback sessions were completed. Usability scoring was consistently high, with median scores ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 on a 5-point scale. The biofeedback optimization algorithm correlated excellently to the raw physiological measurements (r = 0.85, P < .001). The intervention was safe and tolerable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We developed an app for young migraine sufferers to receive therapist-independent biofeedback. The app underwent a rigorous development process as well as usability and feasibility testing. It is now ready for clinical trials.",3
160,Sharing personal ECG time-series data privately,"Objective:
        
      
      Emerging technologies (eg, wearable devices) have made it possible to collect data directly from individuals (eg, time-series), providing new insights on the health and well-being of individual patients. Broadening the access to these data would facilitate the integration with existing data sources (eg, clinical and genomic data) and advance medical research. Compared to traditional health data, these data are collected directly from individuals, are highly unique and provide fine-grained information, posing new privacy challenges. In this work, we study the applicability of a novel privacy model to enable individual-level time-series data sharing while maintaining the usability for data analytics.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      We propose a privacy-protecting method for sharing individual-level electrocardiography (ECG) time-series data, which leverages dimensional reduction technique and random sampling to achieve provable privacy protection. We show that our solution provides strong privacy protection against an informed adversarial model while enabling useful aggregate-level analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We conduct our evaluations on 2 real-world ECG datasets. Our empirical results show that the privacy risk is significantly reduced after sanitization while the data usability is retained for a variety of clinical tasks (eg, predictive modeling and clustering).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our study investigates the privacy risk in sharing individual-level ECG time-series data. We demonstrate that individual-level data can be highly unique, requiring new privacy solutions to protect data contributors.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results suggest our proposed privacy-protection method provides strong privacy protections while preserving the usefulness of the data.",8
161,[Requirements for CE-marking of apps and wearables],"Depending on the intended use, apps and wearables can be medical devices. In such cases, the manufacturer has to provide evidence that the requirements stated in directive 93/42/EWG are fulfilled. Depending on the classification of the medical device, several so-called conformity assessment procedures are possible. Once the conformity assessment procedure has been finished successfully, the manufacturer attaches the CE-marking to the product. This assures that all requirements of the directive have been fulfilled and the manufacturer is therefore authorized to put the product onto the market in all member states of the European union. In this article, the possible and practical conformity assessment procedures for apps and wearables are described and their implementation is outlined.For medical devices with sufficiently high-risk classification, the manufacturer has to involve a Notified Body. For the conformity assessment procedure according to annex II, the manufacturer implements a full quality management system and compiles technical documentation. These are supervised and evaluated by Notified Body audits. Especially for startups, it is important for the development of apps and wearables to implement a quality management system early and to fulfill the regulatory requirements, for example, related to the software life-cycle model. This also includes considering accompanying processes during development like risk management, usability engineering, and clinical evaluation.Additionally, it should be pointed out, that according to the new medical device regulation almost all apps will fall at least into class IIa. Thus, the involvement of a Notified Body in the related conformity assessment procedures would be required. Apps that have already been put onto the market as class I devices, and are now upgraded to a higher class, need the approval of a notified body starting from 26 May 2020.",9
162,A database of physical therapy exercises with variability of execution collected by wearable sensors,"This document introduces the PHYTMO database, which contains data from physical therapies recorded with inertial sensors, including information from an optical reference system. PHYTMO includes the recording of 30 volunteers, aged between 20 and 70 years old. A total amount of 6 exercises and 3 gait variations were recorded. The volunteers performed two series with a minimum of 8 repetitions in each one. PHYTMO includes magneto-inertial data, together with a highly accurate location and orientation in the 3D space provided by the optical system. The files were stored in CSV format to ensure its usability. The aim of this dataset is the availability of data for two main purposes: the analysis of techniques for the identification and evaluation of exercises using inertial sensors and the validation of inertial sensor-based algorithms for human motion monitoring. Furthermore, the database stores enough data to apply Machine Learning-based algorithms. The participants' age range is large enough to establish age-based metrics for the exercises evaluation or the study of differences in motions between different groups.",5
163,Usability of a Wearable Camera System for Dementia Family Caregivers,"Health care providers typically rely on family caregivers (CG) of persons with dementia (PWD) to describe difficult behaviors manifested by their underlying disease. Although invaluable, such reports may be selective or biased during brief medical encounters. Our team explored the usability of a wearable camera system with 9 caregiving dyads (CGs: 3 males, 6 females, 67.00 ± 14.95 years; PWDs: 2 males, 7 females, 80.00 ± 3.81 years, MMSE 17.33 ± 8.86) who recorded 79 salient events over a combined total of 140 hours of data capture, from 3 to 7 days of wear per CG. Prior to using the system, CGs assessed its benefits to be worth the invasion of privacy; post-wear privacy concerns did not differ significantly. CGs rated the system easy to learn to use, although cumbersome and obtrusive. Few negative reactions by PWDs were reported or evident in resulting video. Our findings suggest that CGs can and will wear a camera system to reveal their daily caregiving challenges to health care providers.",3
164,A Systematic Review of Sensing Technologies for Wearable Sleep Staging,"Designing wearable systems for sleep detection and staging is extremely challenging due to the numerous constraints associated with sensing, usability, accuracy, and regulatory requirements. Several researchers have explored the use of signals from a subset of sensors that are used in polysomnography (PSG), whereas others have demonstrated the feasibility of using alternative sensing modalities. In this paper, a systematic review of the different sensing modalities that have been used for wearable sleep staging is presented. Based on a review of 90 papers, 13 different sensing modalities are identified. Each sensing modality is explored to identify signals that can be obtained from it, the sleep stages that can be reliably identified, the classification accuracy of systems and methods using the sensing modality, as well as the usability constraints of the sensor in a wearable system. It concludes that the two most common sensing modalities in use are those based on electroencephalography (EEG) and photoplethysmography (PPG). EEG-based systems are the most accurate, with EEG being the only sensing modality capable of identifying all the stages of sleep. PPG-based systems are much simpler to use and better suited for wearable monitoring but are unable to identify all the sleep stages.",6
165,Parental Perspectives of a Wearable Activity Tracker for Children Younger Than 13 Years: Acceptability and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      There is increasing availability of, and interest in, wearable activity trackers for children younger than 13 years. However, little is known about how children and parents use these activity trackers or perceive their acceptability.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study primarily aimed to ascertain parental perspectives on the acceptability and usability of wearables designed to monitor children's physical activity levels. Secondary aims were to (1) identify practical considerations for future use in physical activity interventions and promotion initiatives; (2) determine use of different features and functions incorporated into the accompanying app; and (3) identify parents' awareness of their child's current physical activity levels.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 36 children (18 boys and 18 girls) aged 7-12 years were asked to wear a wrist-worn activity tracker (KidFit) for 4 consecutive weeks and to use the accompanying app with parental assistance and guidance. Each week, one parent from each family (n=25; 21 mothers and 4 fathers) completed a Web-based survey to record their child's activity tracker use, app interaction, and overall experiences. At the end of the 4-week period, a subsample of 10 parents (all mothers) participated in face-to-face interviews exploring perceptions of the acceptability and usability of wearable activity trackers and accompanying apps. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed descriptively and thematically, respectively. Thematic data are presented using pen profiles, which were constructed from verbatim transcripts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Parents reported that they and their children typically found the associated app easy to use for activity tracking, though only step or distance information was generally accessed and some difficulties interpreting the data were reported. Children were frustrated with not being able to access real-time feedback, as the features and functions were only available through the app, which was typically accessed by, or in the presence of, parents. Parents identified that children wanted additional functions including a visual display to track and self-monitor activity, access to the app for goal setting, and the option of undertaking challenges against schools or significant others. Other barriers to the use of wearable activity trackers included discomfort of wearing the monitor because of the design and the inability to wear for water- or contact-based sports.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most parents reported that the wearable activity tracker was easy for their child or children to use and a useful tool for tracking their children's daily activity. However, several barriers were identified, which may impact sustained use over time; both the functionality and wearability of the activity tracker should therefore be considered. Overall, wearable activity trackers for children have the potential to be integrated into targeted physical activity promotion initiatives.",3
166,Formative Study on the Wearability and Usability of a Large-Volume Patch Injector,"Background:
        
      
      The subcutaneous self-administration of biologics using a single large-volume bolus dose requires novel large-volume patch injectors. However, the usability and wearability of such on-body devices has rarely been investigated thus far. Therefore, this formative simulated use experiment studies the overall handling and acceptability in terms of the size and weight of a novel 10 mL large-volume patch injector device platform.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-three participants, including patients and healthcare professionals, simulated two injections with the large-volume patch injector, each lasting 17 min. During the injections, the patient participants performed predefined movements and activities with the on-body devices. Perceived usability and wearability were assessed through observation by the moderator and participant-reported feedback using five-point Likert scales and open-ended interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All participants successfully completed the simulated injections. Only non-serious usability issues were identified. Users rated the device acceptability in terms of wearability and usability with high ratings.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results suggest the safe and effective usage of a novel prefilled large-volume patch injector that enables the subcutaneous delivery of a single bolus dose of up to 10 mL with an injection duration of 15 min. The participants of the simulated use study successfully used the device regardless of the disease state, age, or body size and habitus.",1
167,"Mobile Personal Health Care System for Noninvasive, Pervasive, and Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring: Development and Usability Study","Background:
        
      
      Smartphone-based blood pressure (BP) monitoring using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to develop a mobile personal health care system for noninvasive, pervasive, and continuous estimation of BP level and variability, which is user friendly for elderly people.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The proposed approach was integrated by a self-designed cuffless, calibration-free, wireless, and wearable PPG-only sensor and a native purposely designed smartphone app using multilayer perceptron machine learning techniques from raw signals. We performed a development and usability study with three older adults (mean age 61.3 years, SD 1.5 years; 66% women) to test the usability and accuracy of the smartphone-based BP monitor.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The employed artificial neural network model had good average accuracy (>90%) and very strong correlation (>0.90) (P<.001) for predicting the reference BP values of our validation sample (n=150). Bland-Altman plots showed that most of the errors for BP prediction were less than 10 mmHg. However, according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society standards, only diastolic blood pressure prediction met the clinically accepted accuracy thresholds.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      With further development and validation, the proposed system could provide a cost-effective strategy to improve the quality and coverage of health care, particularly in rural zones, areas lacking physicians, and areas with solitary elderly populations.",1
168,Self-reconfigurable high-weight-per-volume-gelatin films for all-solution-processed on-skin electronics with ultra-conformal contact,"Although conventional skin-attachable electronics exhibit good functionalities, their direct attachment (without any adhesive) to human skin with sufficient conformal contact is challenging. Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes.",5
169,Can Older Adult Emergency Department Patients Successfully Use the Apple Watch to Monitor Health?,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine usability of the Apple Watch in older adult emergency department (ED) patients after a fall.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We recruited older adults who fell and visited two urban EDs. They participated in an Apple Watch orientation and interviews on their experiences using the watch to complete varied tasks for 30 days. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using framework analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight participants (mean age 77.6 years) enrolled from November 2019 to March 2020. Participants reported being able to apply and charge the watch but struggled with navigating screens, monitoring charging status, and responding with de novo text messages. Many cited difficulties with advanced tasks, such as the study's app-based movement and memory activities. Experience with smartphones and caregiver assistance enhanced users' ability to complete tasks.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Older adults successfully performed basic Apple Watch functions. Family and community members may be necessary to assist with complex tasks.",1
170,Agreement of Sleep Measures-A Comparison between a Sleep Diary and Three Consumer Wearable Devices,"Nowadays, self-tracking and optimization are widely spread. As sleep is essential for well-being, health, and peak performance, the number of available consumer technologies to assess individual sleep behavior is increasing rapidly. However, little is known about the consumer wearables' usability and reliability for sleep tracking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the sleep measures of wearable devices with a standardized sleep diary in young healthy adults in free-living conditions. We tracked night sleep from 30 participants (19 females, 11 males; 24.3 ± 4.2 years old). Each wore three wearables and simultaneously assessed individual sleep patterns for four consecutive nights. Wearables and diaries correlated substantially regarding time in bed (Range CCCLin: 0.74-0.84) and total sleep time (Range CCCLin: 0.76-0.85). There was no sufficient agreement regarding the measures of sleep efficiency (Range CCCLin: 0.05-0.34) and sleep interruptions (Range CCCLin: -0.02-0.10). Finally, these results show wearables to be an easy-to-handle, time- and cost-efficient alternative to tracking sleep in healthy populations. Future research should develop and empirically test the usability of such consumer sleep technologies.",6
171,A Novel Fabric Muscle Based on Shape Memory Alloy Springs,"Fabric muscle is important for wearable robots that are soft, compliant, and silent with high contractility and high force. This study presents a novel shape memory alloy (SMA) spring-based fabric muscle (SFM). The SFM is manufactured by bundling SMA springs with proven performance as artificial muscle. The SFM generates high contractility and high force, and is soft, flexible, and light because it is covered with fabric used to make actual clothes. The SFM is contracted by heat and shows a contraction strain of 50% at a heating temperature of 70°C while generating 100 N force or higher. Furthermore, it generates a maximum contraction strain of 67% under no load. To drive it with the optimum voltage and current, the SFM is designed by optimizing the serial and parallel connection methods for the embedded SMA springs. We propose herein design and manufacturing methods for the SFM and verify the usability of the SFM as a soft actuator through a performance evaluation. The SFM as a soft actuator with a simple structure-like fabric is easily applicable to soft wearable robots that can support muscle power by simply being attached to usual suits. The SFM has a soft touch, and is lightweight; hence, it has the potential for wide applications to new-concept soft wearable robots that can be comfortably worn anytime and anywhere like usual clothes.",0
172,A study on the development of a user-focused multi-functional convergence-smart-fashion product,"The attempts of combining fashion and technology together to provide digital functionalities at the closest distance users has been continued based on context-aware computing and wearable sensing. Through such convergence, the productive benefits of user-oriented computing and the expansion of traditional fashion functionality can be achieved. In this study, we aim to investigate the optimized way for the development of convergence-smart-fashion prototypes that provide user-oriented multi-functionality to increase the potential features of fashion and widen the application scope of related technologies. Through research and development (R&D), we developed four convergence prototypes which could provide four different functions: 1) Rear-detection, which detects vehicles or people approaching from rear-side and warns the user through vibrations. 2) Bluetooth hands-free provides remote-control functions, such as phone-call and sound-streaming. 3) Vital-signal monitoring, which measures and displays user's heart-beat rates and body heat through a built-in-screen and smartphone application for a user's health-care. The development was proceeded based on the following steps: the determination of the basic usability as a garment and its related practical digital functions, the minimization of the size of the system modules which could be easily assembled and disassembled to ease washability, and the system maintenance, which could help to diversify the usage of convergence fashion.",0
173,Do-It-Yourself Augmented Reality Heads-Up Display (DIY AR-HUD): A Technical Note,"Background:
        
      
      We present a ""Do-It-Yourself"" method to build an affordable augmented reality heads-up display system (AR-HUD) capable of displaying intraoperative images. All components are commercially available products, which the surgeons may use in their own practice for educational and research purposes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Moverio BT 35-E smart glasses were connected to operating room imaging modalities (ie, fluoroscopy and 3D navigation platforms) via a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) converter, allowing for continuous high-definition video transmission. The addition of an HDMI transmitter-receiver makes the AR-HUD system wireless.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We used our AR-HUD system in 3 patients undergoing instrumented spinal fusion. AR-HUD projected fluoroscopy images onto the surgical field, eliminating shift of surgeon focus and procedure interruption, with only a 40- to 100-ms delay in transmission, which was not clinically impactful.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An affordable AR-HUD capable of displaying real-time information into the surgeon's view can be easily designed, built, and tested in surgical practice. As wearable heads-up display technology continues to evolve rapidly, individual components presented here may be substituted to improve its functionality and usability. Surgeons are in a unique position to conduct clinical testing in the operating room environment to optimize the augmented reality system for surgical use.",4
174,Opportunities and challenges of using augmented reality and heads-up display in orthopaedic surgery: A narrative review,"Background & aim:
        
      
      Utilization of augmented reality (AR) and heads-up displays (HUD) to aid orthopaedic surgery has the potential to benefit surgeons and patients alike through improved accuracy, safety, and educational benefits. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity for adoption of novel technology is more relevant. The aims are to assess the technology available, to understand the current evidence regarding the benefit and to consider challenges to implementation in clinical practice.
    


          Methods & results:
        
      
      PRISMA guidelines were used to filter the literature. Of 1004 articles returned the following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) reviews/commentaries 2) unrelated to orthopaedic surgery 3) use of other AR wearables beyond visual aids leaving 42 papers for review.This review illustrates benefits including enhanced accuracy and reduced time of surgery, reduced radiation exposure and educational benefits.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Whilst there are obstacles to overcome, there are already reports of technology being used. As with all novel technologies, a greater understanding of the learning curve is crucial, in addition to shielding our patients from this learning curve. Improvements in usability and implementing surgeons' specific needs should increase uptake.",4
175,Older Adults' Experiences With Using Wearable Devices: Qualitative Systematic Review and Meta-synthesis,"Background:
        
      
      Older adults may use wearable devices for various reasons, ranging from monitoring clinically relevant health metrics or detecting falls to monitoring physical activity. Little is known about how this population engages with wearable devices, and no qualitative synthesis exists to describe their shared experiences with long-term use.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to synthesize qualitative studies of user experience after a multi-day trial with a wearable device to understand user experience and the factors that contribute to the acceptance and use of wearable devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic search in CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase (2015-2020; English) with fixed search terms relating to older adults and wearable devices. A meta-synthesis methodology was used. We extracted themes from primary studies, identified key concepts, and applied reciprocal and refutational translation techniques; findings were synthesized into third-order interpretations, and finally, a ""line-of-argument"" was developed. Our overall goal was theory development, higher-level abstraction, and generalizability for making this group of qualitative findings more accessible.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, we reviewed 20 papers; 2 evaluated fall detection devices, 1 tested an ankle-worn step counter, and the remaining 17 tested activity trackers. The duration of wearing ranged from 3 days to 24 months. The views of 349 participants (age: range 51-94 years) were synthesized. Four key concepts were identified and outlined: motivation for device use, user characteristics (openness to engage and functional ability), integration into daily life, and device features. Motivation for device use is intrinsic and extrinsic, encompassing many aspects of the user experience, and appears to be as, if not more, important than the actual device features. To overcome usability barriers, an older adult must be motivated by the useful purpose of the device. A device that serves its intended purpose adds value to the user's life. The user's needs and the support structure around the device-aspects that are often overlooked-seem to play a crucial role in long-term adoption. Our ""line-of-argument"" model describes how motivation, ease of use, and device purpose determine whether a device is perceived to add value to the user's life, which subsequently predicts whether the device will be integrated into the user's life.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The added value of a wearable device is the resulting balance of motivators (or lack thereof), device features (and their accuracy), ease of use, device purpose, and user experience. The added value contributes to the successful integration of the device into the daily life of the user. Useful device features alone do not lead to continued use. A support structure should be placed around the user to foster motivation, encourage peer engagement, and adapt to the user's preferences.",1
176,"Colorophone 2.0: A Wearable Color Sonification Device Generating Live Stereo-Soundscapes-Design, Implementation, and Usability Audit","The successful development of a system realizing color sonification would enable auditory representation of the visual environment. The primary beneficiary of such a system would be people that cannot directly access visual information-the visually impaired community. Despite the plethora of sensory substitution devices, developing systems that provide intuitive color sonification remains a challenge. This paper presents design considerations, development, and the usability audit of a sensory substitution device that converts spatial color information into soundscapes. The implemented wearable system uses a dedicated color space and continuously generates natural, spatialized sounds based on the information acquired from a camera. We developed two head-mounted prototype devices and two graphical user interface (GUI) versions. The first GUI is dedicated to researchers, and the second has been designed to be easily accessible for visually impaired persons. Finally, we ran fundamental usability tests to evaluate the new spatial color sonification algorithm and to compare the two prototypes. Furthermore, we propose recommendations for the development of the next iteration of the system.",3
177,Glasses-type wearable computer displays: usability considerations examined with a 3D glasses case study,"This study presents usability considerations and solutions for the design of glasses-type wearable computer displays and examines their effectiveness in a case study. Design countermeasures were investigated by a four-step design process: (1) preliminary design analysis; (2) design idea generation; (3) final design selection; and (4) virtual fitting trial. Three design interventions were devised from the design process: (1) weight balance to reduce pressure concentrated on the nose, (2) compliant temples to accommodate diverse head sizes and (3) a hanger mechanism to help spectacle users hang their wearable display on their eye glasses. To investigate their effectiveness, in the case study, the novel 3D glasses adopting the three interventions were compared with two existing 3D glasses in terms of neck muscle fatigue and subjective discomfort rating. While neck muscle fatigue was not significantly different among the three glasses (p = 0.467), the novel glasses had significantly smaller discomfort ratings (p = 0.009). Relevance to Industry: A four-step design process identified usability considerations and solutions for the design of glasses-type wearable computer displays. A novel 3D glasses was proposed through the process and its effectiveness was validated. The results identify design considerations and opportunities relevant to the emerging wearable display industry.",0
178,Feasibility of a Waistband-Type Wireless Wearable Electrocardiogram Monitoring System Based on a Textile Electrode: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions.",0
179,Feasibility and Usability of Tele-interview for Medical Residency Interview,"Every year in the United States, medical students and residency programs dedicate millions of dollars to the residency matching process. On-site interviews for training positions involve tremendous financial investment, and time spent detracts from educational pursuits and clinical responsibilities. Students are usually required to fund their own travel and accommodations, adding additional financial burdens to an already costly medical education. Similarly, residency programs allocate considerable funds to interview-day meals, tours, staffing, and social events. With the rapid onslaught of innovations and advancements in the field of telecommunication, technology has become ubiquitous in the practice of medicine. Internet applications have aided our ability to deliver appropriate, evidence-based care at speeds previously unimagined. Wearable medical tech allows physicians to monitor patients from afar, and telemedicine has emerged as an economical means by which to provide care to all corners of the world. It is against this backdrop that we consider the integration of technology into the residency application process. This article aims to assess the implementation of technology in the form of web-based interviewing as a viable means by which to reduce the costs and productivity losses associated with traditional in-person interview days.",0
180,Wearable UV Sensor Based on Carbon Nanotube-Coated Cotton Thread,"A fabric-compatible UV sensor is presented using a cellulose-based thread coated with single-wall carbon nanotube ink. Two-terminal resistive responses of the thread were measured upon exposure to UV, and the effects of intensity, wavelength, and on/off cycling were studied. The sensor was tested in the field under direct sunlight, demonstrating practical usability for a wearable/flexible UV sensor system. The results here confirm the potential for an inexpensive wearable sensor in contrast to the conventional rigid and bulky solid-state detectors.",0
181,Usability of Wearable Multiparameter Technology to Continuously Monitor Free-Living Vital Signs in People Living With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Prospective Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Vital signs monitoring (VSM) is routine for inpatients, but monitoring during free-living conditions is largely untested in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study investigated the usability and acceptability of continuous VSM for people with COPD using wearable multiparameter technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 50 people following hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and 50 people with stable COPD symptoms were asked to wear an Equivital LifeMonitor during waking hours for 6 weeks (42 days). The device recorded heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin temperature, and physical activity. Adherence was defined by the number of days the vest was worn and daily wear time. Signal quality was examined, with thresholds of ≥85% for HR and ≥80% for RR, based on the device's proprietary confidence algorithm. Data quality was calculated as the percentage of wear time with acceptable signal quality. Participant feedback was assessed during follow-up phone calls.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 84% of participants provided data, with average daily wear time of 11.8 (SD 2.2) hours for 32 (SD 11) days (average of study duration 76%, SD 26%). There was greater adherence in the stable group than in the post-AECOPD group (≥5 weeks wear: 71.4% vs 45.7%; P=.02). For all 84 participants, the median HR signal quality was 90% (IQR 80%-94%) and the median RR signal quality was 93% (IQR 92%-95%). The median HR data quality was 81% (IQR 58%-91%), and the median RR data quality was 85% (IQR 77%-91%). Stable group BMI was associated with HR signal quality (rs=0.45, P=.008) and HR data quality (rs=0.44, P=.008). For the AECOPD group, RR data quality was associated with waist circumference and BMI (rs=-0.49, P=.009; rs=-0.44, P=.02). In total, 36 (74%) participants in the Stable group and 21 (60%) participants in the AECOPD group accepted the technology, but 10 participants (12%) expressed concerns with wearing a device around their chest.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This wearable multiparametric technology showed good user acceptance and was able to measure vital signs in a COPD population. Data quality was generally high but was influenced by body composition. Overall, it was feasible to continuously measure vital signs during free-living conditions in people with COPD symptoms but with additional challenges in the post-AECOPD context.",6
182,Wearable Sensors for Nurses: Which Requirements Have to Be Considered?,"To measure and compare the workload of nurses in a clinical setting raises up some questions. On the one hand we worked out which criteria can represent workload and how it can be measured. On the other hand we compile different requirements for wearable sensors. These requirements can be categorized in four groups: data, robustness, hygiene and usability. These results can support the selection of wearable sensors for a survey of the workload of nurses in a clinical setting.",4
183,Usability and performance of a wearable tele-echography robot for focused assessment of trauma using sonography,"Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) is widely used as a first lifesaving step for patients suffering from internal bleeding. Because it may take a long time to transport such patients to a hospital, a wearable and portable tele-echography robot that a paramedic can attach to the patient has been developed. In the current study, experiments were conducted to evaluate the usability and performance of attached FAST. The proposed robot must be attached to 4 areas to perform FAST. The time required for attachment and the positions of attachment completed by 9 non-medical staff members, as well as the time it took for the FAST to reach a medical doctor, were measured. The echo images obtained when the patient's body was in motion were evaluated by a medical doctor. The robot could be attached to all 4 areas within approximately 5min, and the maximum gap was 4.8cm. This indicates that a paramedic who has received training in emergency medical care should be able to attach the robot to a patient quickly and accurately. Additionally, it was confirmed that the robot could be used to complete FAST under a doctor's control within 9min and that the extracted echo images were suitable for FAST. A comparison of the results with current ambulance transportation time confirmed that FAST could be completed approximately 14min before the patient reached the hospital. The results of the current study indicate that the robot is worth using, is suitable for FAST, and will be effective in emergency medical care.",8
184,Wearable sensors for multifactorial personal exposure measurements - A ranking study,"Individuals are simultaneously exposed to multiple environmental stressors during their daily life. Studies of adverse health effects and their etiology as well as recommendations for a healthier life style demand for an assessment of multifactorial personal exposure, according to the exposome concept. A challenge is to record exposure while people are moving in heterogeneous urban environments. Therefore wearable sensor technologies are becoming a promising way to measure personal exposure continuously: indoors, outdoors and even on the move. So far, studies which test the accuracy and usability of wearable sensors for multiple stressors are lacking. Performance evaluations are important and should take place beforehand, especially to ensure the success of citizens-oriented studies. For the first time we rigorously examined the accuracy and application suitability of wearable sensors for acoustic noise, heat (temp), particle number counts (PNC) and geo-location (GPS) in different environments. We present an extensive device inter-comparison and a ranking of the sensors based on performance measures, Taylor diagrams, Bland-Altman plots, and ease-of-use aspects. The sensors showed moderate to high correlations with precision reference devices (r = 0.4-0.99). Differences between errors outdoors and indoors suggest that environmental conditions have impact upon the accuracy of the sensors. Reaction time, recording interval, and sensor ventilation are features that play a crucial role for both ease-of-use and accuracy. We conclude with a final performance () ranking: (GPS) > (noise) > (temp) > (PNC). The results are relevant for future epidemiological studies of multifactorial exposure of individuals and their health and should guide the selection of wearables when persons are involved that are technically untaught. Inferences from multifactorial data are based on the performance of all sensors and the weakest chain links are PNC and temp sensors for which our article recommends urgent improvements.",4
185,Measuring the Usability of eHealth Solutions for Patients With Parkinson Disease: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a variety of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Many of these symptoms can be monitored by eHealth solutions, including smartphone apps, wearable sensors, and camera systems. The usability of such systems is a key factor in long-term use, but not much is known about the predictors of successful use and preferable methods to assess usability in patients with PD.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study tested methods to assess usability and determined prerequisites for successful use in patients with PD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed comprehensive usability assessments with 18 patients with PD using a mixed methods usability battery containing the System Usability Scale, a rater-based evaluation of device-specific tasks, and qualitative interviews. Each patient performed the usability battery with 2 of 3 randomly assigned devices: a tablet app, wearable sensors, and a camera system. The usability battery was administered at the beginning and at the end of a 4-day testing period. Between usability batteries, the systems were used by the patients during 3 sessions of motor assessments (wearable sensors and camera system) and at the movement disorder ward (tablet app).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this study, the rater-based evaluation of tasks discriminated the best between the 3 eHealth solutions, whereas subjective modalities such as the System Usability Scale were not able to distinguish between the systems. Successful use was associated with different clinical characteristics for each system: eHealth literacy and cognitive function predicted successful use of the tablet app, and better motor function and lower age correlated with the independent use of the camera system. The successful use of the wearable sensors was independent of clinical characteristics. Unfortunately, patients who were not able to use the devices well provided few improvement suggestions in qualitative interviews.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      eHealth solutions should be developed with a specific set of patients in mind and subsequently tested in this cohort. For a complete picture, usability assessments should include a rater-based evaluation of task performance, and there is a need to develop strategies to circumvent the underrepresentation of poorly performing patients in qualitative usability research.",8
186,Health professionals' attitudes to patients' use of wearable technology,"Objective:
        
      
      Wearable technologies for health monitoring are becoming increasingly mainstream. However, there is currently limited evidence exploring use from the perspective of healthcare professionals. This study aimed to explore health professionals' attitudes toward their patients' use of wearable technologies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A convenience sample of health professionals was recruited to participate in this study. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out either face-to-face, via Skype or telephone. Interviews were recorded using a Dictaphone, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four themes emerged from the qualitative findings: 'opportunities for wearable technology', 'usability and understanding', 'privacy and surveillance' and 'cost'.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings portray health professionals' ambivalence to the use of wearable technology, and it was apparent that whilst the participants considered the technology as being beneficial to patients, they still had concerns for its use.",2
187,A Self-Charging Supercapacitor for a Patch-Type Glucose Sensor,"Wearable electronic medical devices measuring continuous biological signals for early disease diagnosis should be small and lightweight for consecutive usability. As a result, there has been an increasing need for new energy supply systems that provide continuous power without any interruption to the operation of the medical devices associated with the use of conventional batteries. In this work, we developed a patch-type self-charging supercapacitor that can measure biological signals with a continuous energy supply without batteries. The glucose oxidase coated on the surface of the microneedle-type glucose sensor encounters glucose in the interstitial fluids of the human body. Electrons created by glucose oxidation operate the self-powered system in which charging begins with the generation of potential differences in supercapacitor electrodes. In an 11 mM glucose solution, the self-powered solid-state supercapacitors (SPSCs) showed a power density of 0.62 mW/cm2, which resulted in self-charging of the supercapacitor. The power density produced by each SPSC with a drop of 11 mM glucose solution was higher than that produced by glucose-based biofuel cells. Consequently, the all-in-one self-powered glucose sensor, with the aid of an Arduino Uno board and appropriate programming, effectively distinguished normal, prediabetic, and diabetic levels from 0.5 mL of solutions absorbed in a laboratory skin model.",5
188,Efficacy of a Novel Intraoperative Engineered Sharps Injury Prevention Device: Pilot Usability and Efficacy Trial,"Background:
        
      
      The American College of Surgeons reports 88,320 intraoperative needlestick injuries (NSIs) per year, resulting in US $376 to US $2456 in costs per NSI. Engineered sharps injury prevention (ESIP) devices protect against NSIs. To our knowledge, no study has been published to date to demonstrate clinical effectiveness of an intraoperative ESIP device. Operative Armour is a wearable arm cuff that can be donned during surgical closure to allow surgeons to keep a suture pack and sharps protection container on their forearm.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We characterize Operative Armour's ESIP device effectiveness in a tertiary hospital, hypothesizing that this device will decrease NSI risk by decreasing behaviors associated with NSIs: needle passing and handling.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective case-control study was conducted with institutional review board quality improvement designation in which authors observed skin closures of plastic surgery procedures. To ensure accuracy, one surgeon was observed at a time. Control surgeries were purely observational; intervention cases involved surgeon use of the device during skin closure. Outcomes of interest included needle passing, needle handling, lost needles, and loaded waiting needles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Surgeons were observed in 50 control and 50 intervention cases. Operative Armour eliminated needle passing during skin closure. One NSI occurred in one control case; no NSIs were observed in intervention cases (P=.36). The mean number of loaded and unprotected waiting needles was also significantly decreased in the intervention group from 2.3 to 0.2 (P<.001). Furthermore, a multivariable linear regression established that Operative Armour significantly decreased the number of needle adjustments by hand per stitch observed (F4, 21.68=3.72; P=.01). In fact, needle adjustments by hand decreased overall (1 adjustment per 10 stitches vs 1 adjustment per 5 stitches, P=.004), and adjustments occurred half as frequently with use of Operative Armour in free flap reconstruction (1 adjustment per 10 stitches vs 1 adjustment per 5 stitches, P=.03) and a quarter as frequently in other breast reconstruction cases such as mastopexy (1 adjustment per 20 stitches vs 1 adjustment per 5 stitches, P=.002).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Operative Armour effectively functions as an ESIP device by decreasing intraoperative needle passing and handling. Although sample size prohibits demonstrating a decrease in NSIs during observed cases, by decreasing behaviors that drive NSI risk, we anticipate an associated decrease in NSIs with use of the device.",4
189,Feasibility of a Mobile-Based System for Unsupervised Monitoring in Parkinson's Disease,"Mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as a potential solution to providing valuable ecological information about the severity and burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms in real-life conditions. Objective: The objective of our study was to explore the feasibility and usability of an mHealth system for continuous and objective real-life measures of patients' health and functional mobility, in unsupervised settings. Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD, who were able to walk unassisted, and had an Android smartphone were included. Patients were asked to answer a daily survey, to perform three weekly active tests, and to perform a monthly in-person clinical assessment. Feasibility and usability were explored as primary and secondary outcomes. An exploratory analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between data from the mKinetikos app and clinical assessments. Results: Seventeen participants (85%) completed the study. Sixteen participants (94.1%) showed a medium-to-high level of compliance with the mKinetikos system. A 6-point drop in the total score of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire was observed. Conclusions: Our results support the feasibility of the mKinetikos system for continuous and objective real-life measures of a patient's health and functional mobility. The observed correlations of mKinetikos metrics with clinical data seem to suggest that this mHealth solution is a promising tool to support clinical decisions.",6
190,UV Curable Conductive Ink for the Fabrication of Textile-Based Conductive Circuits and Wearable UHF RFID Tags,"Textile is a kind of emerging substrate for wearable printed electronics to realize recyclable smart products by versatile and low-cost screen printing. The high temperature sintering step is necessary to get high surface electrical conductivity, whereas most of the common fabrics have poor temperature endurance. Meanwhile, both rough surface and porous structure of fabrics are not beneficial to obtain high-resolution and high-quality circuits. In this work, the ultraviolet (UV) curable conductive inks with low-temperature and short-time curing were developed for screen-printing e-textiles, and the rheological behavior of conductive inks with different polymer contents was characterized in order to determine the ink formulation suitable for screen printing on fabrics. To demonstrate the usability of the developed ink in fabricating e-textiles, the conductive lines with different widths as well as the antenna for UHF RFID tags were screen-printed on plain nylon-woven fabrics. The geometric morphology and the electrical properties of the printed conductive lines were evaluated. The results showed that the screen-printed conductive lines have a minimum line width of 0.2 mm, highest conductivity of 6.02 × 106 S m-1, and good bending endurance at a bending radius of 5 mm. Also, the feasibility of UV curable conductive ink for a fabric-based electronic device was confirmed by the screen-printed antenna of UHF RFID tags, and the reading distance after five cycles of washing is still over 3.0 m. Generally, this work developed a kind of low-temperature curing ink characterized by direct screen printing on common fabrics and high electrical conductivity after curing, and it will facilitate the use of textiles as the screen-printed substrates for flexible and wearable electronic devices.",0
191,Evaluation of New Technology-Based Tools for Dietary Intake Assessment-An ILSI Europe Dietary Intake and Exposure Task Force Evaluation,"Background:
        
      
      New technology-based dietary assessment tools, including Web-based programs, mobile applications, and wearable devices, may improve accuracy and reduce costs of dietary data collection and processing. The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Europe Dietary Intake and Exposure Task Force launched this project to evaluate new tools in order to recommend general quality standards for future applications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature search identified technology-based dietary assessment tools, including those published in English from 01/2011 to 09/2017, and providing details on tool features, functions and uses. Each of the 43 tools identified (33 for research and 10 designed for consumer use) was rated on 25 attributes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most of the tools identified (79%) relied on self-reported dietary intakes. Most (91%) used text entry and 33% used digital images to help identify foods. Only 65% had integrated databases for estimating energy or nutrients. Fewer than 50% contained any features of customization and about half generated automatic reports. Most tools reported on usability or reported validity compared with another assessment method (77%). A set of Best Practice Guidelines was developed for reporting dietary assessment tools using new technology.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dietary assessment methods that utilize technology offer many advantages for research and are often preferable to consumers over more traditional methods. In order to meet general quality standards, new technology tools require detailed publications describing tool development, food identification and quantification, customization, outputs, food composition tables used, and usability/validity testing.",4
192,User-centered Design and Evaluation of Physical Interfaces for an Exoskeleton for Paraplegic Users,"Over the last decade, the use of wearable exoskeletons for human locomotion assistance has become more feasible. The VariLeg powered lower limb robotic exoskeleton is an example of such systems, potentially enabling paraplegic users to perform upright activities of daily living. The acceptance of this type of robotic assistive technologies is often still affected by limited usability, in particular regarding the physical interface between the exoskeleton and the user (here referred to as pilot). In this study, we proposed and evaluated a novel pilot attachment system (PAS), which was designed based on user-centered design with experienced paraplegic exoskeleton users. Subjective assessments to compare usability aspects of the initial and the redesigned physical interfaces were conducted with two paraplegic and five healthy pilots. The redesigned PAS showed a 45% increase in the system usability scale (SUS), normalized to the PAS of a commercial exoskeleton assessed in the same manner. Pain rating scales assessed with healthy pilots indicated an increased comfort using the redesigned PAS while performing several activities of daily living. Overall, an improvement in usability relative to the initial PAS was achieved through intensified user evaluation and individual needs assessments. Hence, a user-centered design of physical body-machine interfaces has the potential to positively influence the usability and acceptance of lower limb exoskeletons for paraplegic users.",3
193,"The Ubiquitous Cognitive Assessment Tool for Smartwatches: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation Study","Background:
        
      
      Cognitive functioning plays a significant role in individuals' mental health, since fluctuations in memory, attention, and executive functions influence their daily task performance. Existing digital cognitive assessment tools cannot be administered in the wild and their test sets are not brief enough to capture frequent fluctuations throughout the day. The ubiquitous availability of mobile and wearable devices may allow their incorporation into a suitable platform for real-world cognitive assessment.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aims of this study were threefold: (1) to evaluate a smartwatch-based tool for the assessment of cognitive performance, (2) to investigate the usability of this tool, and (3) to understand participants' perceptions regarding the application of a smartwatch in cognitive assessment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We built the Ubiquitous Cognitive Assessment Tool (UbiCAT) on a smartwatch-based platform. UbiCAT implements three cognitive tests-an Arrow test, a Letter test, and a Color test-adapted from the two-choice reaction-time, N-back, and Stroop tests, respectively. These tests were designed together with domain experts. We evaluated the UbiCAT test measures against standard computer-based tests with 21 healthy adults by applying statistical analyses significant at the 95% level. Usability testing for each UbiCAT app was performed using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) questionnaire. The NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) questionnaire was used to measure cognitive workload during the N-back test. Participants rated perceived discomfort of wearing a smartwatch during the tests using a 7-point Likert scale. Upon finishing the experiment, an interview was conducted with each participant. The interviews were transcribed and semantic analysis was performed to group the findings.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Pearson correlation analysis between the total correct responses obtained from the UbiCAT and the computer-based tests revealed a significant strong correlation (r=.78, P<.001). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant effect of the N-back difficulty level on the participants' performance measures. The study also demonstrated usability ratings above 4 out of 5 in terms of aesthetics, functionality, and information. Low discomfort (<3 out of 7) was reported by our participants after using the UbiCAT. Seven themes were extracted from the transcripts of the interviews conducted with our participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      UbiCAT is a smartwatch-based tool that assesses three key cognitive domains. Usability ratings showed that participants were engaged with the UbiCAT tests and did not feel any discomfort. The majority of the participants were interested in using the UbiCAT, although some preferred computer-based tests, which might be due to the widespread use of personal computers. The UbiCAT can be administered in the wild with mentally ill patients to assess their attention, working memory, and executive function.",3
194,ECG performance in simultaneous recordings of five wearable devices using a new morphological noise-to-signal index and Smith-Waterman-based RR interval comparisons,"Background:
        
      
      Numerous wearables are used in a research context to record cardiac activity although their validity and usability has not been fully investigated. The objectives of this study is the cross-model comparison of data quality at different realistic use cases (cognitive and physical tasks). The recording quality is expressed by the ability to accurately detect the QRS complex, the amount of noise in the data, and the quality of RR intervals.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Five ECG devices (eMotion Faros 360°, Hexoskin Hx1, NeXus-10 MKII, Polar RS800 Multi and SOMNOtouch NIBP) were attached and simultaneously tested in 13 participants. Used test conditions included: measurements during rest, treadmill walking/running, and a cognitive 2-back task. Signal quality was assessed by a new local morphological quality parameter morphSQ which is defined as a weighted peak noise-to-signal ratio on percentage scale. The QRS detection performance was evaluated with eplimited on synchronized data by comparison to ground truth annotations. A modification of the Smith-Waterman algorithm has been used to assess the RR interval quality and to classify incorrect beat annotations. Evaluation metrics includes the positive predictive value, false negative rates, and F1 scores for beat detection performance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All used devices achieved sufficient signal quality in non-movement conditions. Over all experimental phases, insufficient quality expressed by morphSQ values below 10% was only found in 1.22% of the recorded beats using eMotion Faros 360°whereas the rate was 8.67% with Hexoskin Hx1. Nevertheless, QRS detection performed well across all used devices with positive predictive values between 0.985 and 1.000. False negative rates are ranging between 0.003 and 0.017. eMotion Faros 360°achieved the most stable results among the tested devices with only 5 false positive and 19 misplaced beats across all recordings identified by the Smith-Waterman approach.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Data quality was assessed by two new approaches: analyzing the noise-to-signal ratio using morphSQ, and RR interval quality using Smith-Waterman. Both methods deliver comparable results. However the Smith-Waterman approach allows the direct comparison of RR intervals without the need for signal synchronization whereas morphSQ can be computed locally.",9
195,Smartwatch monitoring for atrial fibrillation after stroke-The Pulsewatch Study: Protocol for a multiphase randomized controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder that elevates stroke risk. Stroke survivors undergo routine heart rhythm monitoring for AF. Smartwatches are capable of AF detection and potentially can replace traditional cardiac monitoring in stroke patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The goal of Pulsewatch is to assess the accuracy, usability, and adherence of a smartwatch-based AF detection system in stroke patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study will consist of two parts. Part I will have 6 focus groups with stroke patients, caretakers, and physicians, and a Hack-a-thon, to inform development of the Pulsewatch system. Part II is a randomized clinical trial with 2 phases designed to assess the accuracy and usability in the first phase (14 days) and adherence in the second phase (30 days). Participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio (intervention to control) for the first phase, and both arms will receive gold-standard electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. The intervention group additionally will receive a smartphone/smartwatch dyad with the Pulsewatch applications. Upon completion of 14 days, participants will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will receive the Pulsewatch system and a handheld ECG device, while the control group will be passively monitored. Participants will complete questionnaires at enrollment and at 14- and 44-day follow-up visits to assess various psychosocial measures and health behaviors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Part I was completed in August 2019. Enrollment for Part II began September 2019, with expected completion by the end of 2021.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pulsewatch aims to demonstrate that a smartwatch can be accurate for real-time AF detection, and that older stroke patients will find the system usable and will adhere to monitoring.",0
196,"The Dry Revolution: Evaluation of Three Different EEG Dry Electrode Types in Terms of Signal Spectral Features, Mental States Classification and Usability","One century after the first recording of human electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, EEG has become one of the most used neuroimaging techniques. The medical devices industry is now able to produce small and reliable EEG systems, enabling a wide variety of applications also with no-clinical aims, providing a powerful tool to neuroscientific research. However, these systems still suffer from a critical limitation, consisting in the use of wet electrodes, that are uncomfortable and require expertise to install and time from the user. In this context, dozens of different concepts of EEG dry electrodes have been recently developed, and there is the common opinion that they are reaching traditional wet electrodes quality standards. However, although many papers have tried to validate them in terms of signal quality and usability, a comprehensive comparison of different dry electrode types from multiple points of view is still missing. The present work proposes a comparison of three different dry electrode types, selected among the main solutions at present, against wet electrodes, taking into account several aspects, both in terms of signal quality and usability. In particular, the three types consisted in gold-coated single pin, multiple pins and solid-gel electrodes. The results confirmed the great standards achieved by dry electrode industry, since it was possible to obtain results comparable to wet electrodes in terms of signals spectra and mental states classification, but at the same time drastically reducing the time of montage and enhancing the comfort. In particular, multiple-pins and solid-gel electrodes overcome gold-coated single-pin-based ones in terms of comfort.",0
197,Designing an IT Ecosystem for Pregnancy Care Management Based on Pervasive Technologies,"Pregnancy care is a topic of interest for both academia and practitioners. Novel pervasive technologies and applications, such as mobile technologies, wearables and IoT, open a wide corpus of possibilities for fostering pregnancy care management, and reducing risks and problems, improving communication among stakeholders and society development. This article introduces a model of a pregnancy care IT ecosystem based on the integration of various services in a semantically enriched e-health ecosystem. As proof of concept, both the web and mobile applications that aim to help pregnant women and gynaecologists were designed and employed in a real environment. An evaluation of the developed ecosystem was performed on a sample of 500 pregnant women and 100 doctors. After pilot usage, a survey was used to collect the data from participants, and assess the acceptance of the developed system. Results show that quality, usability and usefulness are on a high level, and that both pregnant women and doctors are ready for more extensive use of the system. In addition, research findings imply that employing pervasive technologies could bring significant benefits to all the parties in pregnancy care systems.",2
198,User Experience of Augmented Reality System for Astronaut's Manual Work Support,"This paper introduces Augmented Reality (AR) system to support an astronaut's manual work, it has been developed in two phases. The first phase was developed in Europeans Space Agency's (ESA) project called ""EdcAR-Augmented Reality for Assembly, Integration, Testing and Verification, and Operations"" and the second phase was developed and evaluated within the Horizon 2020 project ""WEKIT-Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training."" The main aim is to create an AR based technological platform for high knowledge manual work support, in the aerospace industry with reasonable user experience. The AR system was designed for the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform, and it was implemented based on a modular architecture. The purpose of the evaluation of the AR system is to prove that reasonable user experience of augmented reality can reduce performance errors while executing a procedure, increase memorability, and improve cost, and time efficiency of the training. The main purpose of the first phase evaluation was to observe and get feedback from the AR system, from user experience point-of-view for the future development. The use case was a filter change in International Space Station (ISS)-Columbus mock-up in the ESA's European Astronaut Centre (EAC). The test group of 14 subjects it included an experienced astronaut, EAC trainers, other EAC personnel, and a student group. The second phase the experiment consisted of an in-situ trial and evaluation process. The augmented reality system was tested at ALTEC facilities in Turin, Italy, where 39 participants were performing an actual real astronaut's procedure, the installation of Temporary Stowage Rack (TSR) on a physical mock-up of an ISS module. User experience evaluation was assessed using comprehensive questionnaires, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their experience with a platform. This focused on technology acceptance, system usability, smart glasses user satisfaction, user interaction satisfaction, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their experience with a platform. The analysis of the questionnaires and interviews showed that the scores obtained for user experience, usability, user satisfaction, and technology acceptance were near the desired average. Specifically, The System Usability Scale (SUS) score was 68 indicating that the system usability is already nearly acceptable in the augmented reality platform.",4
199,A motion artifact generation and assessment system for the rapid testing of surface biopotential electrodes,"Dry electrodes can reduce cost while increasing the usability and comfort of wearable monitoring systems. They are, however, susceptible to motion artifacts. The present electrode testing methods lack reliability and do not separate the factors that affect the motion artifact. In this paper, we introduce a first generation motion artifact generation and assessment system that generates the speed, amplitude, and pattern-wise programmable movement of the electrode. The system simultaneously measures electrode-skin impedance, the motion artifact, and one channel of an electrocardiogram that contains the motion artifact and monitors the mounting force applied to the electrode. We demonstrate the system by comparing the applied movement and the measured signals for electrode movements up to 6 mm and movement frequencies from 0.4 Hz to 4 Hz. Results show that the impedance change and surface potential are visually clearly related to the applied motion, with average correlations of 0.89 and 0.64, respectively. The applied force, electrode location, and electrode structure all affect the motion artifact. The setup enables the motion of the electrode to be accurately controlled. The system can be used as a precursor to the testing of integrated systems because it enables thorough, repeatable, and robust motion artifact studies. The system allows a deeper insight into motion artifacts and the interplay of the various factors that affect them.",3
200,"Using wearables to promote physical activity in old age : Feasibility, benefits, and user friendliness","Background:
        
      
      Wearables provide new opportunities to promote physical activity also among older adults but data on effectiveness and user friendliness are rare.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The effects of a comprehensive self-regulative intervention on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and number of steps were examined using commercially available activity trackers. Acceptance regarding the devices was analysed in various domains.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this study 80 older adults (mean = 67.03 years, standard deviation = 3.97 years; 59% women) wore a Fitbit Charge HR for 21 days including a baseline, a postintervention and a follow-up week. The intervention comprised feedback, goal setting and planning and 50% of the participants were additionally randomized to a role model component. Social cognitive predictors based on the health action process approach (HAPA) and user experience were assessed via questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The MVPA increased by an average of 19 min per week and steps by 1317 per day. An additional benefit of the role model component could be observed for MVPA. In the follow-up, the intervention effect was still significant for the number of steps, while MVPA dropped back to baseline. Multilevel models including HAPA variables explained small but significant amounts of variance in MVPA (8% within-person, 26% between-person) and steps (11% within-person, 12% between-person). User experience was rated as very high.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Providing an intervention based on established behavior change techniques and self-monitoring via wearables seems to be effective for increasing physical activity among older adults. The HAPA variables seem to play a limited role to explain activity levels. Acceptance of wearables can be expected to be high.",3
201,Digital Technology and Mobile Health in Behavioral Migraine Therapy: a Narrative Review,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      This article reviews the recent research and development of electronic health (eHealth) and, in particular, mobile health (mHealth) strategies to deliver behavioral treatment for migraine. Prospects for future development and research of mobile health in migraine are suggested.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Advances in digital technology and mobile technology have led to an era where electronic and mobile approaches are applied to several aspects of healthcare. Electronic behavioral interventions for migraine seem to be acceptable and feasible, but efficacy measures are uncertain. Clinical trials on mHealth-based classical behavioral therapies, such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioral therapy are missing in the literature. Within mHealth, headache diaries are the most researched and scientifically developed. Still, there is a gap between commercially available apps and scientifically validated and developed apps. Digital technology and mobile health has not yet lived out its potential in behavioral migraine therapy. Application of proper usability and functionality designs towards the right market, together with appraisal of medical and technological recommendations, may facilitate rapid development of eHealth and mHealth, while also establishing scientific evidence.",2
202,A Flexible Carbon Nanotubes-Based Auxetic Sponge Electrode for Strain Sensors,"Soft compliant strain gauges are key devices for wearable applications such as body health sensor systems, exoskeletons, or robotics. Other than traditional piezoresistive materials, such as metals and doped semiconductors placed on strain-sensitive microsystems, a class of soft porous materials with exotic mechanical properties, called auxetics, can be employed in strain gauges in order to boost their performance and add functionalities. For strain electronic read-outs, their polymeric structure needs to be made conductive. Herein, we present the fabrication process of an auxetic electrode based on a polymeric nanocomposite. A multiwalled carbon nanotube/polydimethylsiloxane (MWCNT/PDMS) is fabricated on an open-cell polyurethane (PU) auxetic foam and its effective usability as an electrode for strain-gauge sensors is assessed.",0
203,Review of Wearable Devices and Data Collection Considerations for Connected Health,"Wearable sensor technology has gradually extended its usability into a wide range of well-known applications. Wearable sensors can typically assess and quantify the wearer's physiology and are commonly employed for human activity detection and quantified self-assessment. Wearable sensors are increasingly utilised to monitor patient health, rapidly assist with disease diagnosis, and help predict and often improve patient outcomes. Clinicians use various self-report questionnaires and well-known tests to report patient symptoms and assess their functional ability. These assessments are time consuming and costly and depend on subjective patient recall. Moreover, measurements may not accurately demonstrate the patient's functional ability whilst at home. Wearable sensors can be used to detect and quantify specific movements in different applications. The volume of data collected by wearable sensors during long-term assessment of ambulatory movement can become immense in tuple size. This paper discusses current techniques used to track and record various human body movements, as well as techniques used to measure activity and sleep from long-term data collected by wearable technology devices.",3
204,Safety and usability of wearable accelerometers for stroke detection the STROKE ALARM PRO 1 study,"Objectives:
        
      
      The introduction of time-dependent reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke has increased the need for early identification. We explore the safety and feasibility of STROKE ALARM which detects sudden arm paresis, the most frequent symptom in stroke.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Consecutive patients admitted with a stroke or TIA at Skåne University Hospital were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and included in the STROKE ALARM PRO 1 Study aiming to explore the feasibility of prolonged use (30 days) of the system in the community. STROKE ALARM consists of paired arm bracelets with accelerometers, coupled with a stroke test in a smartphone application. In case of an imbalance in arm movements, the user is prompted to perform an app-based stroke test. Failure to respond or to complete the stroke test correctly, triggers notification by SMS to predefined emergency contacts. Patients were followed up by telephone after completion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty patients were included and 28 completed follow-up. Median age was 68 years and 36.7% were female. No stroke events were recorded during follow-up. False indications occurred in all but one patient, and 22 (78.6%) experienced alarms to their emergency contacts. Despite a high level of false alarms, general user experience was rated in a positive or neutral manner by almost 90%. Very frequent alarms were probably due to mild arm paresis not detected in routine clinical assessment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Use of STROKE ALARM for 30 days after stroke/TIA was well tolerated warranting further study for early automated detection of stroke recurrence.",5
205,Biofeedback Systems for Gait Rehabilitation of Individuals with Lower-Limb Amputation: A Systematic Review,"Individuals with lower-limb amputation often have gait deficits and diminished mobility function. Biofeedback systems have the potential to improve gait rehabilitation outcomes. Research on biofeedback has steadily increased in recent decades, representing the growing interest toward this topic. This systematic review highlights the methodological designs, main technical and clinical challenges, and evidence relating to the effectiveness of biofeedback systems for gait rehabilitation. This review provides insights for developing an effective, robust, and user-friendly wearable biofeedback system. The literature search was conducted on six databases and 31 full-text articles were included in this review. Most studies found biofeedback to be effective in improving gait. Biofeedback was most commonly concurrently provided and related to limb loading and symmetry ratios for stance or step time. Visual feedback was the most used modality, followed by auditory and haptic. Biofeedback must not be obtrusive and ideally provide a level of enjoyment to the user. Biofeedback appears to be most effective during the early stages of rehabilitation but presents some usability challenges when applied to the elderly. More research is needed on younger populations and higher amputation levels, understanding retention as well as the relationship between training intensity and performance.",3
206,Evaluation of a Wearable Non-Invasive Thermometer for Monitoring Ear Canal Temperature during Physically Demanding (Outdoor) Work,"Aimed at preventing heat strain, health problems, and absenteeism among workers with physically demanding occupations, a continuous, accurate, non-invasive measuring system may help such workers monitor their body (core) temperature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and explore the usability of the wearable non-invasive Cosinuss° °Temp thermometer. Ear canal temperature was monitored in 49 workers in real-life working conditions. After individual correction, the results of the laboratory and field study revealed high correlations compared to ear canal infrared thermometry for hospital use. After performance of the real-life working tasks, this correlation was found to be moderate. It was also observed that the ambient environmental outdoor conditions and personal protective clothing influenced the accuracy and resulted in unrealistic ear canal temperature outliers. It was found that the Cosinuss° °Temp thermometer did not result in significant interference during work. Therefore, it was concluded that, without a correction factor, the Cosinuss° °Temp thermometer is inaccurate. Nevertheless, with a correction factor, the reliability of this wearable ear canal thermometer was confirmed at rest, but not in outdoor working conditions or while wearing a helmet or hearing protection equipment.",0
207,A Simulated Graphical Interface for Integrating Patient-Generated Health Data From Smartwatches With Electronic Health Records: Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable technology, such as smartwatches, can capture valuable patient-generated data and help inform patient care. Electronic health records provide logical and practical platforms for including such data, but it is necessary to evaluate the way the data are presented and visualized.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a graphical interface that displays patients' health data from smartwatches, mimicking the integration within the environment of electronic health records.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 12 health care professionals evaluated a simulated interface using a usability scale questionnaire, testing the clarity of the interface, colors, usefulness of information, navigation, and readability of text.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The interface was positively received, with 14 out of the 16 questions generating a score of 5 or greater among at least 75% of participants (9/12). On an 8-point Likert scale, the highest rated features of the interface were quick turnaround times (mean score 7.1), readability of the text (mean score 6.8), and use of terminology/abbreviations (mean score 6.75).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Collaborating with health care professionals to develop and refine a graphical interface for visualizing patients' health data from smartwatches revealed that the key elements of the interface were acceptable. The implementation of such data from smartwatches and other mobile devices within electronic health records should consider the opinions of key stakeholders as the development of this platform progresses.",2
208,"Assessing the potential for ""undesired"" effects of passive back-support exoskeleton use during a simulated manual assembly task: Muscle activity, posture, balance, discomfort, and usability","Back-support exoskeletons (BSEs) are wearable systems designed to reduce physical demands on the back, but which could have undesired effects beyond this design intention. Participants (n = 18) used two commercial BSEs to complete a brief (~15-20 s) simulated manual assembly task in varying conditions, with outcome measures that included: working posture, activity levels in ""secondary"" muscle groups (shoulders and thighs), perceived balance, discomfort, and usability. Using a BSE led to small and inconsistent changes in working postures (e.g., < ~14° change in lumbar flexion), muscular activity in the secondary muscle groups (<±2% of maximum voluntary isometric contractions), or perceived balance. Limitations in movement were reported for both BSEs, however, along with moderate levels of discomfort. Task-specific responses were evident for all outcome measures, though these depended on the specific BSE used and differed between genders in many cases. Future work should focus on interactions between a given user, BSE design, and task conditions.",0
209,Simple Approach to High-Performance Stretchable Heaters Based on Kirigami Patterning of Conductive Paper for Wearable Thermotherapy Applications,"Recent efforts to develop stretchable resistive heaters open up the possibility for their use in wearable thermotherapy applications. Such heaters should have high electrothermal performance and stability to be used practically, and the fabrication must be simple, economic, reproducible, and scalable. Here we present a simple yet highly efficient way of producing high-performance stretchable heaters, which is based on a facile kirigami pattering (the art of cutting and folding paper) of a highly conductive paper for practical wearable thermotherapy. The resulting kirigami heater exhibits high heating performance at low voltage (>40 °C at 1.2 V) and fast thermal response (<60 s). The simple kirigami patterning approach enables the heater to be extremely stretchable (>400%) while stably retaining its excellent performance. Furthermore, the heater shows the uniform spatial distribution of heat over the whole heating area and is highly durable (1000 cycles at 300% strain). The heater attached to curvilinear body parts shows stable heating performance even under large motions while maintaining intimate conformal contact with the skin thanks to the high stretchability and sufficient restoring force. The usability of the heater as a wearable thermotherapy device is demonstrated by increased blood flow at the wrist during operation.",5
210,Derivative Based Gait Event Detection Algorithm Using Unfiltered Accelerometer Signals,"Wearable sensors have been investigated for the purpose of gait analysis, namely gait event detection. Many types of algorithms have been developed specifically using inertial sensor data for detecting gait events. Though much attention has turned toward machine learning algorithms, most of these approaches suffer from large computational requirements and are not yet suitable for real-time applications such as in prostheses or for feedback control. Current rules-based algorithms for real-time use often require fusion of multiple sensor signals to achieve high accuracy, thus increasing complexity and decreasing usability of the instrument. We present our results of a novel, rules-based algorithm using a single accelerometer signal from the foot to reliably detect heel-strike and toe-off events. Using the derivative of the raw accelerometer signal and applying an optimizer and windowing approach, high performance was achieved with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.32% and 94.70% respectively, and a timing error of 6.52 ± 22.37 ms, including trials involving multiple speed transitions. This would enable development of a compact wearable system for robust gait analysis in real-world settings, providing key insights into gait quality with the capability for real-time system control.",3
211,A Novel Mobile Health Tool for Home-Based Identification of Neonatal Illness in Uganda: Formative Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      While early identification of neonatal illness can impact neonatal mortality rates and reduce the burden of treatment, identifying subtle clinical signs and symptoms of possible severe illness is especially challenging in neonates. The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund developed the Integrated Management of Neonatal Childhood Illness guidelines, an evidence-based tool highlighting seven danger signs to assess neonatal health. Currently, many mothers in low-resource settings rely on home visits from community health workers (CHWs) to determine if their baby is sick. However, CHWs visit infrequently, and illness is often detected too late to impact survival. Thus, delays in illness identification pose a significant barrier to providing expedient and effective care. Neonatal Monitoring (NeMo), a novel neonatal assessment tool, seeks to increase the frequency of neonatal screening by task-shifting identification of neonatal danger signs from CHWs to mothers.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to explore the usability and acceptability of the NeMo system among target users and volunteer CHWs by assessing ease of use and learnability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Simulated device use and semistructured interviews were conducted with 32 women in the Iganga-Mayuge districts in eastern Uganda to evaluate the usability of the NeMo system, which involves a smartphone app paired with a low cost, wearable band to aid in identification of neonatal illness. Two versions of the app were evaluated using a mixed methods approach, and version II of the app contained modifications based on observations of the first cohort's use of the system. During the posed scenario simulations, participants were offered limited guidance from the study team in order to probe the intuitiveness of the NeMo system. The ability to complete a set of tasks with the system was tested and recorded for each participant and closed- and open-ended questions were used to elicit user feedback. Additionally, focus groups with 12 CHWs were conducted to lend additional context and insight to the usability and feasibility assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 13/22 subjects (59%) using app version I and 9/10 subjects (90%) using app version II were able to use the phone and app with no difficulty, despite varying levels of smartphone experience. Following modifications to the app's audio instructions in version II, participants' ability to accurately answer qualitative questions concerning neonatal danger signs improved by at least 200% for each qualitative danger sign. All participants agreed they would trust and use the NeMo system to assess the health of their babies. Furthermore, CHWs emphasized the importance of community sensitization towards the system to encourage its adoption and regular use, as well as the decision to seek care based on its recommendations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The NeMo system is an intuitive platform for neonatal assessment in a home setting and was found to be acceptable to women in rural Uganda.",2
212,Person-Generated Health Data in Women's Health: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      Due to their ability to collect person-generated health data, digital tools and connected health devices may hold great utility in disease prevention, chronic disease self-monitoring and self-tracking, as well as in tailoring information and educational content to fit individual needs. Facilitators and barriers to the use of digital health technologies vary across demographics, including sex. The ""femtech"" market is growing rapidly, and women are some of the largest adopters of digital health technologies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper aims to provide the background and methods for conducting a scoping review on the use of person-generated health data from connected devices in women's health. The objectives of the scoping review are to identify the various contexts of digital technologies in women's health and to consolidate women's views on the usability and acceptability of the devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Searches were conducted in the following databases: Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science Core Collection. We included articles from January 2015 to February 2020. Screening of articles was done independently by at least two authors in two stages. Data charting is being conducted in duplicate. Results will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our search identified 9102 articles after deduplication. As of November 2020, the full-text screening stage is almost complete and data charting is in progress. The scoping review is expected to be completed by Fall 2021.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This scoping review will broadly map the literature regarding the contexts and acceptability of digital health tools for women. The results from this review will be useful in guiding future digital health and women's health research.

213,Using Google Glass in Nonsurgical Medical Settings: Systematic Review,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable technologies provide users hands-free access to computer functions and are becoming increasingly popular on both the consumer market and in various industries. The medical industry has pioneered research and implementation of head-mounted wearable devices, such as Google Glass. Most of this research has focused on surgical interventions; however, other medical fields have begun to explore the potential of this technology to support both patients and clinicians.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our aim was to systematically evaluate the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of using Google Glass in nonsurgical medical settings and to determine the benefits, limitations, and future directions of its application.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This review covers literature published between January 2013 and May 2017. Searches included PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, INSPEC (Ebsco), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), IEEE Explore, Web of Science, Scopus, and Compendex. The search strategy sought all articles on Google Glass. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full-text articles, and extracted data from articles that met all predefined criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or consultation by the senior author. Included studies were original research articles that evaluated the feasibility, usability, or acceptability of Google Glass in nonsurgical medical settings. The preferred reporting results of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for reporting of results.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 852 records examined, 51 met all predefined criteria, including patient-centered (n=21) and clinician-centered studies (n=30). Patient-centered studies explored the utility of Google Glass in supporting patients with motor impairments (n=8), visual impairments (n=5), developmental and psychiatric disorders (n=2), weight management concerns (n=3), allergies (n=1), or other health concerns (n=2). Clinician-centered studies explored the utility of Google Glass in student training (n=9), disaster relief (n=4), diagnostics (n=2), nursing (n=1), autopsy and postmortem examination (n=1), wound care (n=1), behavioral sciences (n=1), and various medical subspecialties, including, cardiology (n=3), radiology (n=3), neurology (n=1), anesthesiology (n=1), pulmonology (n=1), toxicology (n=1), and dermatology (n=1). Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (40/51, 78%), did not report specific age information for participants (38/51, 75%), had sample size <30 participants (29/51, 57%), and were pilot or feasibility studies (31/51, 61%). Most patient-centered studies (19/21, 90%) demonstrated feasibility with high satisfaction and acceptability among participants, despite a few technical challenges with the device. A number of clinician-centered studies (11/30, 37%) reported low to moderate satisfaction among participants, with the most promising results being in the area of student training. Studies varied in sample size, approach for implementation of Google Glass, and outcomes assessment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of Google Glass in nonsurgical medical settings varied. More promising results regarding the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of using Google Glass were seen in patient-centered studies and student training settings. Further research evaluating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Google Glass as an intervention to improve important clinical outcomes is warranted.",4
214,Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation (BREATHE): toward an mHealth informatics platform,"Objective:
        
      
      To describe a configurable mobile health (mHealth) framework for integration of physiologic and environmental sensors to be used in studies focusing on the domain of pediatric asthma.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation (BREATHE) platform connects different sensors and data streams, contextualizing an individual's symptoms and daily activities over time to understand pediatric asthma's presentation and its management. A smartwatch/smartphone combination serves as a hub for personal/wearable sensing devices collecting data on health (eg, heart rate, spirometry, medications), motion, and personal exposures (eg, particulate matter, ozone); securely transmitting information to BREATHE's servers; and interacting with the user (eg, ecological momentary assessments). Server-side integration of electronic health record data and spatiotemporally correlated information (eg, weather, traffic) elaborates on these observations. An initial panel study involving pediatric asthma patients was conducted to assess BREATHE.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty subjects were enrolled, during which BREATHE accrued seven consecutive days of continuous data per individual. The data were used to confirm knowledge about asthma (use of controller inhalers, time-activity behaviors, personal air pollution exposure), and additional analyses provided insights into within-day associations of environmental triggers and asthma exacerbations. Exit surveys focusing on mHealth usability, while positive, noted several translational challenges.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Based on these promising results, a longitudinal panel study to evaluate individual microenvironments and exposures is ongoing. Lessons learned thus far reflect the need to address various usability aspects, including convenience and ongoing engagement.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      BREATHE enables multi-sensor mHealth studies, capturing new types of information alongside an evolving understanding of personal exposomes.",1
215,TWIICE One powered exoskeleton: effect of design improvements on usability in daily life as measured by the performance in the CYBATHLON race,"Background:
        
      
      Spinal cord injury leading to paraplegia affects the mobility and physiological well-being of one in a thousand people. Powered exoskeletons can temporarily restore the ability to walk. Their relevance in daily life is still limited because of low performance beyond ground that is even. CYBATHLON is an international competition promoting improvements in assistive technology. In this article, we present the latest design and results of testing of TWIICE One version 2018, one of the competing devices in the 2020 race.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A person with a motor-complete spinal cord injury at thoracic level T10 participated as race pilot. Training ahead of the race took place over one week at a rate of 2 h per day. The time to perform each of the seven tasks of the competition was recorded together with the number of repetitions. Performance is compared over the training period and against the 2016 race results.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Progression was observed in all tasks and accounted for by both user training and technology improvements. Final competition rank was second out of seven participating teams, with a record time of 4'40"". This represents an average improvement of 40% with respect to comparable obstacles of the 2016 race, explaining the two ranks of improvement since then.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These results help understand which features had a positive impact on the real-life performance of the device. Understanding how design affects performance is key information to create devices that really improve the life of people living with paraplegia.",7
216,Towards a Framework for Evaluating Mobile Mental Health Apps,"Introduction:
        
      
      Mobile phones are ubiquitous in society and owned by a majority of psychiatric patients, including those with severe mental illness. Their versatility as a platform can extend mental health services in the areas of communication, self-monitoring, self-management, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the efficacy and reliability of publicly available applications (apps) have yet to be demonstrated. Numerous articles have noted the need for rigorous evaluation of the efficacy and clinical utility of smartphone apps, which are largely unregulated. Professional clinical organizations do not provide guidelines for evaluating mobile apps.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Guidelines and frameworks are needed to evaluate medical apps. Numerous frameworks and evaluation criteria exist from the engineering and informatics literature, as well as interdisciplinary organizations in similar fields such as telemedicine and healthcare informatics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We propose criteria for both patients and providers to use in assessing not just smartphone apps, but also wearable devices and smartwatch apps for mental health. Apps can be evaluated by their usefulness, usability, and integration and infrastructure. Apps can be categorized by their usability in one or more stages of a mental health provider's workflow.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Ultimately, leadership is needed to develop a framework for describing apps, and guidelines are needed for both patients and mental health providers.",2
217,Assessment of an active industrial exoskeleton to aid dynamic lifting and lowering manual handling tasks,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an industrial exoskeleton on muscle activity, perceived musculoskeletal effort, measured and perceived contact pressure at the trunk, thighs and shoulders, and subjective usability for simple sagittal plane lifting and lowering conditions. Twelve male participants lifted and lowered a box of 7.5 kg and 15 kg, respectively, from mid-shin height to waist height, five times, both with and without the exoskeleton. The device significantly reduced muscle activity of the Erector Spinae (12%-15%) and Biceps Femoris (5%). Ratings of perceived musculoskeletal effort in the trunk region were significantly less with the device (9.5%-11.4%). The measured contact pressure was highest on the trunk (91.7 kPa-93.8 kPa) and least on shoulders (47.6 kPa-51.7 kPa), whereas pressure was perceived highest on the thighs (35-44% of Max LPP). Six of the users rated the device usability as acceptable. The exoskeleton reduced musculoskeletal loading on the lower back and assisted with hip extensor torque during lifting and lowering. Contact pressures fell below the Pain Pressure Threshold. Perceived pressure was not exceptionally high, but sufficiently high to cause discomfort if used for long durations.",3
218,Objective Measurement of Hyperactivity Using Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning: Pilot Study,"Background:
        
      
      Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there are no objective measures that are widely used in clinical settings.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We describe the development of a smartwatch app to measure hyperactivity in school-age children. The LemurDx prototype is a software system for smartwatches that uses wearable sensor technology and machine learning to measure hyperactivity. The goal is to differentiate children with ADHD combined presentation (a combination of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive presentations) or predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation from children with typical levels of activity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this pilot study, we recruited 30 children, aged 6 to 11 years, to wear a smartwatch with the LemurDx app for 2 days. Parents also provided activity labels for 30-minute intervals to help train the algorithm. Half of the participants had ADHD combined presentation or predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation (n=15), and half were in the healthy control group (n=15).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results indicated high usability scores and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 0.89 (sensitivity=0.93; specificity=0.86) when the motion sensor output was paired with the activity labels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      State-of-the-art sensors and machine learning may provide a promising avenue for the objective measurement of hyperactivity.",1
219,ESUMS: a mobile system for continuous home monitoring of rehabilitation patients,"The pressure on the healthcare services is building up for several reasons. The ageing population trend, the increase in life-style related disease prevalence, as well as the increased treatment capabilities with associated general expectation all add pressure. The use of ambient healthcare technologies can alleviate the situation by enabling time and cost-efficient monitoring and follow-up of patients discharged from hospital care. We report on an ambulatory system developed for monitoring of physical rehabilitation patients. The system consists of a wearable multisensor monitoring device; a mobile phone with client application aggregating the data collected; a service-oriented-architecture based server solution; and a PC application facilitating patient follow-up by their health professional carers. The system has been tested and verified for accuracy in controlled environment trials on healthy volunteers, and also been usability tested by 5 congestive heart failure patients and their nurses. This investigation indicated that patients were able to use the system, and that nurses got an improved basis for patient follow-up.",2
220,Qualitative assessment of tongue drive system by people with high-level spinal cord injury,"The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a minimally invasive, wireless, and wearable assistive technology (AT) that enables people with severe disabilities to control their environments using tongue motion. TDS translates specific tongue gestures into commands by sensing the magnetic field created by a small magnetic tracer applied to the user's tongue. We have previously quantitatively evaluated the TDS for accessing computers and powered wheelchairs, demonstrating its usability. In this study, we focused on its qualitative evaluation by people with high-level spinal cord injury who each received a magnetic tongue piercing and used the TDS for 6 wk. We used two questionnaires, an after-scenario and a poststudy, designed to evaluate the tongue-piercing experience and the TDS usability compared with that of the sip-and-puff and the users' current ATs. After study completion, 73% of the participants were positive about keeping the magnetic tongue-barbell in order to use the TDS. All were satisfied with the TDS performance and most said that they were able to do more things using TDS than their current ATs (4.22/5).",3
221,Stereo Vision Based Sensory Substitution for the Visually Impaired,"The development of computer vision based systems dedicated to help visually impaired people to perceive the environment, to orientate and navigate has been the main research subject of many works in the recent years. A significant ensemble of resources has been employed to support the development of sensory substitution devices (SSDs) and electronic travel aids for the rehabilitation of the visually impaired. The Sound of Vision (SoV) project used a comprehensive approach to develop such an SSD, tackling all the challenging aspects that so far restrained the large scale adoption of such systems by the intended audience: Wearability, real-time operation, pervasiveness, usability, cost. This article is set to present the artificial vision based component of the SoV SSD that performs the scene reconstruction and segmentation in outdoor environments. In contrast with the indoor use case, where the system acquires depth input from a structured light camera, in outdoors SoV relies on stereo vision to detect the elements of interest and provide an audio and/or haptic representation of the environment to the user. Our stereo-based method is designed to work with wearable acquisition devices and still provide a real-time, reliable description of the scene in the context of unreliable depth input from the stereo correspondence and of the complex 6 DOF motion of the head-worn camera. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on a custom benchmarking dataset acquired with SoV cameras and provide the highlights of the usability evaluation with visually impaired users.",0
222,Framework of sensor-based monitoring for pervasive patient care,"Sensor-based health systems can often become difficult to use, extend and sustain. The authors propose a framework for designing sensor-based health monitoring systems aiming to provide extensible and usable monitoring services in the scope of pervasive patient care. The authors' approach relies on a distributed system for monitoring the patient health status anytime-anywhere and detecting potential health complications, for which healthcare professionals and patients are notified accordingly. Portable or wearable sensing devices measure the patient's physiological parameters, a smart mobile device collects and analyses the sensor data, a Medical Center system receives notifications on the detected health condition, and a Health Professional Platform is used by formal caregivers in order to review the patient condition and configure monitoring schemas. A Service-oriented architecture is utilised to provide extensible functional components and interoperable interactions among the diversified system components. The framework was applied within the REMOTE ambient-assisted living project in which a prototype system was developed, utilising Bluetooth to communicate with the sensors and Web services for data exchange. A scenario of using the REMOTE system and preliminary usability results show the applicability, usefulness and virtue of our approach.",2
223,iHandU: A Novel Quantitative Wrist Rigidity Evaluation Device for Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is the gold standard therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease (PD) with motor complications, notwithstanding drug therapy. In the intraoperative evaluation of DBS's efficacy, neurologists impose a passive wrist flexion movement and qualitatively describe the perceived decrease in rigidity under different stimulation parameters and electrode positions. To tackle this subjectivity, we designed a wearable device to quantitatively evaluate the wrist rigidity changes during the neurosurgery procedure, supporting physicians in decision-making when setting the stimulation parameters and reducing surgery time. This system comprises a gyroscope sensor embedded in a textile band for patient's hand, communicating to a smartphone via Bluetooth and has been evaluated on three datasets, showing an average accuracy of 80%. In this work, we present a system that has seen four iterations since 2015, improving on accuracy, usability and reliability. We aim to review the work done so far, outlining the iHandU system evolution, as well as the main challenges, lessons learned, and future steps to improve it. We also introduce the last version (iHandU 4.0), currently used in DBS surgeries at São João Hospital in Portugal.",0
224,Whole Body Awareness for Controlling a Robotic Transfemoral Prosthesis,"Restoring locomotion functionality of transfemoral amputees is essential for early rehabilitation treatment and for preserving mobility and independence in daily life. Research in wearable robotics fostered the development of innovative active mechatronic lower-limb prostheses designed with the goal to reduce the cognitive and physical effort of lower-limb amputees in rehabilitation and daily life activities. To ensure benefits to the users, active mechatronic prostheses are expected to be aware of the user intention and properly interact in a closed human-in-the-loop paradigm. In the state of the art various cognitive interfaces have been proposed to online decode the user's intention. Electromyography in combination with mechanical sensing such as inertial or pressure sensors is a widely adopted solution for driving active mechatronic prostheses. In this framework, researchers also explored targeted muscles re-innervation for an objective-oriented surgical amputation promoting wider usability of active prostheses. However, information kept by the neural component of the cognitive interface deteriorates in a prolonged use scenario due to electrodes-related issues, thereby undermining the correct functionality of the active prosthesis. The objective of this work is to present a novel controller for an active transfemoral prosthesis based on whole body awareness relying on a wireless distributed non-invasive sensory apparatus acting as cognitive interface. A finite-state machine controller based on signals monitored from the wearable interface performs subject-independent intention detection of functional tasks such as ground level walking, stair ascent, and sit-to-stand maneuvres and their main sub-phases. Experimental activities carried out with four transfemoral amputees (among them one dysvascular) demonstrated high reliability of the controller capable of providing 100% accuracy rate in treadmill walking even for weak subjects and low walking speeds. The minimum success rate was of 94.8% in performing sit-to-stand tasks. All the participants showed high confidence in using the transfemoral active prosthesis even without training period thanks to intuitiveness of the whole body awareness controller.",0
225,Myoelectric untethered robotic glove enhances hand function and performance on daily living tasks after stroke,"Introduction:
        
      
      Wearable robots controlled using electromyography could motivate greater use of the affected upper extremity after stroke and enable bimanual activities of daily living to be completed independently.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We have developed a myoelectric untethered robotic glove (My-HERO) that provides five-finger extension and grip assistance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The myoelectric controller detected the grip and release intents of the 9 participants after stroke with 84.7% accuracy. While using My-HERO, all 9 participants performed better on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Hand (8.4 point increase, scale out of 14, p < 0.01) and the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (8.2 point increase, scale out of 91, p < 0.01). Established criteria for clinically meaningful important differences were surpassed for both the hand function and daily living task assessments. The majority of participants provided satisfaction and usability questionnaire scores above 70%. Seven participants desired to use My-HERO in the clinic and at home during their therapy and daily routines.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      People with hand impairment after stroke value that myoelectric untethered robotic gloves enhance their motion and bimanual task performance and motivate them to use their muscles during engaging activities of daily living. They desire to use these gloves daily to enable greater independence and investigate the effects on neuromuscular recovery.",5
226,SENS-U: continuous home monitoring of natural nocturnal bladder filling in children with nocturnal enuresis - a feasibility study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Enuresis is a common problem in children. One treatment option is a wetting alarm that provides an alarm when incontinence occurs. A drawback of this approach is that the child is still awakened by wet sheets. Recently, a wearable, wireless ultrasonic bladder sensor became available, the SENS-U, which has the potential to prevent the enuretic event by waking up the child before the bladder is full. In this first feasibility study, the aim is to perform a night-time, home-based evaluation of the SENS-U in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      In this study, children (6-12 years) with MNE were included for a one-night monitoring session. During the night, the SENS-U continuously (i.e. every 30 s) estimated the filling status [notifications were deactivated]. In addition, urine volume was collected in a measurement cup (or diaper weight). The total measured natural nocturnal bladder filling (NNBF) cycles was analyzed by descriptive statistics. Before and after the measurement, sleep behavior was assessed by a selection of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen patients (boys/girls: 13/2) [mean age: 8.6 ± 1.5 years] have been enrolled. One patient was excluded due to inadequate sensor-to-skin contact. For 14 children, 18 NNBF cycles were recorded (voiding diary) of which three patients (21%) had more than one NNBF cycle. The SENS-U was able to successfully detect 83% of the NNBF cycles. The three missed NNBF cycles had a voided volume ≤30 ml, which was at the lower limit of the sensor's detection range. The SENS-U had no effect on sleeping behavior.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The SENS-U was able to monitor the natural nocturnal bladder filling successfully in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis at home, without disturbing their sleep. Future research focuses on investigating the usability of the SENS-U for both diagnostic - and treatment purposes.",0
227,"Technology Ready to be Launched, but is there a Payer? Challenges for Implementing eHealth in Sweden","The development of a sustainable, high-quality, affordable health care is today a high priority for many actors in the society. This is to ensure that we will continue to afford to care for the growing portion of elderly in our population. One solution is to enable the individual's power over her own health or illness, and participation in her own care. There are evidently opportunities with the rapid development of eHealth and wearable sensors. Tracking and measuring vital data can help to keep people out of the hospital. Loads of data is generated to help us understand disease, to provide us with early diagnostics and warnings. It is providing us with possibilities to collect and capture the true health status of individuals. Successful technologies demonstrate savings, acceptance among users and improved access to healthcare. But there are also challenges. Implementing new technologies in health care is difficult. Researchers from around the world are reporting on similar problems, such as reimbursement, interoperability, usability and regulatory issues. This paper will discuss a few of these implementation challenges as well as a few of the efforts in meeting them. To conclude, eHealth solutions can contribute to patient empowerment and a sustainable health care. Our assumption is however, that as long as we do not face the implementation challenges and invest in overcoming the pressing obstacles, society will not be able, or willing, to pay for the solutions.",2
228,Are Seizure Detection Devices Ready for Prime Time?,"Standards for testing and clinical validation of seizure detection Beniczky S, Ryvlin P. Epilepsia. 2018;59(S1):9-13. https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.14049 To increase the quality of studies on seizure detection devices, we propose standards for testing and clinical validation of such devices. We identified 4 key features that are important for studies on seizure detection devices: subjects, recordings, data analysis and alarms, and reference standard. For each of these features, we list the specific aspects that need to be addressed in the studies, and depending on these, studies are classified into 5 phases (0-4). We propose a set of outcome measures that need to be reported, and we propose standards for reporting the results. These standards will help in designing and reporting studies on seizure detection devices, they will give readers clear information on the level of evidence provided by the studies, and they will help regulatory bodies in assessing the quality of the validation studies. These standards are flexible, allowing classification of the studies into one of the 5 phases. We propose actions that can facilitate development of novel methods and devices. User-based evaluation of applicability and usability of a wearable accelerometer device for detecting bilateral tonic-clonic seizures: a field study Meritam P, Ryvlin P, Beniczky S. Epilepsia. 2018;59(S1):48-52. https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.14051 Clinical validation studies of seizure detection devices conducted in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) can be biased by the artificial environment. We report a field (phase 4) study of a wearable accelerometer device (Epi-Care) that has previously been validated in EMUs for detecting bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (BTCS). Seventy-one patients using the device (or their caregivers) completed the modified Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire. Median time patients had been using the device was 15 months (range = 24 days to 6 years). In 10% of cases, patients stopped using the device due to reasons related to the device. The median sensitivity (90%) and false alarm rate (0.1/day) were similar to what had been determined in EMUs. Patients and caregivers were overall satisfied with the device (median = 5.5 on the 7-point Likert scale), considered the technical aspects satisfactory, and considered the device comfortable and efficient. Adverse effects occurred in 11% but were only mild: skin irritation at the wrist and interference with home electronic appliances. In 55%, the device influenced the number of seizures logged into the seizure diary, and in 40%, it contributed to fewer seizure-related injuries. This field study demonstrates the applicability and usability of the wearable accelerometer device for detecting BTCS. Wearable devices for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy prevention Ryvlin P, Ciumas C, Wisniewski I, Beniczky S. Epilepsia. 2018;59(S1):61-66. https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.14054 Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is most often associated with the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), a seizure type that can now be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by wearable or bed devices. The recent development in such devices and their performance offer multiple opportunities to tackle SUDEP and its prevention. Reliable GTCS detection might help physicians optimize antiepileptic treatment, which could in turn reduce the risk of SUDEP. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures-triggered alarms can lead to immediate intervention by caregivers that are also likely to decrease the odd of SUDEP. The biosignals used to detect GTCS might provide novel SUDEP biomarkers, in particular, by informing on several important characteristics of the ictal and postictal periods (type of GTCS, duration of tonic phase, rotation in the prone position, presence and duration of postictal immobility and bradycardia, rise in electrodermal activity). Other biosensors not yet used for detecting GTCS might provide complementary information, such as the presence and intensity of ictal/postictal hypoxemia. The above biomarkers, if strongly predictive, could help identify patients at very high risk of SUDEP, enabling better assessment of individual risk, as well as selection of appropriate patients for clinical studies aiming at preventing SUDEP. The same biosignals could also be used as ancillary biomarkers to test the impact of various interventions before moving to highly challenging randomized controlled trials with SUDEP as a primary outcome.",9
229,Tablet-Based Well-Being Check for the Elderly: Development and Evaluation of Usability and Acceptability,"Background:
        
      
      Many elderly people prefer to live at home independently. One of the major concerns raised by the family members is the safety and well-being of their elderly family members when living independently in a home environment. To address this issue, assistive technology solutions have been available in the market. Despite their availability and proliferation, these types of solutions are not popular with the elderly due to their intrusive nature, privacy-related issues, social stigma, and fear of losing human interaction. This study shares the experience in the development of a digital photo frame system that helps family members to check the well-being of the elderly, exploiting their desire to remain socially connected.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to iteratively design, implement, and assess the usability, user friendliness, and acceptability of a tablet-based system to check the well-being of the elderly.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Our study methodology comprises three separate stages: initial system development, contextual assessment, and comparative case study evaluation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the first stage, requirements were elicited from the elderly to design a well-being check prototype. In the second stage, areas for improvements (eg, privacy features) were identified. Also, additional features (such as medication prompts or food reminders) were suggested to help aged and health care service providers with effective but subtle monitoring of the elderly. These would lower their operating cost by reducing visits by care providers to the homes of the elderly. In the third stage, the results highlighted the difference (between users in India and Australia) in the levels of familiarity of the elderly with this technology. Some elderly participants at the Kalyani Institute for Study, Planning and Action for Rural Change, India latched onto this technology quickly while a few refused to use the system. However, in all cases, the support of family members was crucial for their willingness to use the technology.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This project has three major outcomes. First, a picture frame prototype was tested with the elderly to leverage the benefits of social communication. Second, the project helped us test and implement the ""Silvercare"" model for supporting the elderly through young retired people residing in the area. Finally, the project helped formalize the agile three-stage design methodology to develop information technology solutions for the elderly. Also, the project contributed to an ongoing European Union Project called Victoryahome, which involves more than 50 sites across 5 countries (Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Portugal, and Australia) to assess the use of telepresence robots, wearable fall detectors, and medication dispensers for the elderly living independently.",2
230,Feasibility and usability of a wearable orthotic for stroke survivors with hand impairment,"Purpose:
        
      
      The concept of a vibrating wristband, to improve dextrous hand function of stroke survivors, was recently proposed with clinical results and is referred to as 'TheraBracelet' in this paper. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate feasibility of a portable, wearable TheraBracelet, and to apply usability evaluation techniques to assess potential demands of TheraBracelet and to identify critical improvement needs of the prototype.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A prototype was developed with a vibrating element housed in an elastic wristband and connected to a wearable electronics box via a cable. Expectation for TheraBracelet and evaluation of the prototype were obtained from 10 chronic stroke survivors using surveys before and after using the prototype and House of Quality analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survey for expectation showed stroke survivors' willingness to try out TheraBracelet at a low cost. The survey evaluating the prototype showed that the current prototype was overall satisfactory with a mean rating of 3.7 out of 5. The House of Quality analysis revealed that the priority improvement needs for the prototype are to improve clinical knowledge on long-term effectiveness, reduce cost, ease donning/doffing and waterproof.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study presents a potential for a low-cost wearable hand orthotic likable by stroke survivors. Implications for Rehabilitation Feasibility for a portable wearable wristband-type hand orthotic was demonstrated. The survey showed stroke survivors are willing to try such an orthotic at low cost. The current prototype was rated overall satisfactory by stroke survivors. This study provides a potential for a low-cost wearable hand orthotic likable by stroke survivors.",5
231,Usability Evaluation for the Amulet Wearable Device in Rural Older Adults with Obesity,"Mobile health (mHealth) interventions hold the promise of augmenting existing health promotion interventions. Older adults present unique challenges in advancing new models of health promotion using technology including sensory limitations and less experience with mHealth, underscoring the need for specialized usability testing. We use an open-source mHealth device as a case example for its integration in a newly designed health services intervention. We performed a convergent, parallel mixed-methods study including semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires, using purposive sampling of 29 older adults, 4 community leaders and 7 clinicians in a rural setting We transcribed the data, developed codes informed by thematic analysis using inductive and deductive methods, and assessed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. Our results suggest the importance of end-users in user-centered design of mHealth devices and that aesthetics are critically important. The prototype could potentially be feasibly integrated within health behavior interventions. Centralized dashboards were desired by all participants and ecological momentary assessment could be an important part of monitoring. Concerns of mHealth, including the prototype device, include the device's accuracy, its intrusiveness in daily life and privacy. Formative evaluations are critically important prior to deploying large-scale interventions.",2
232,Development of 3D-printed myoelectric hand orthosis for patients with spinal cord injury,"Background:
        
      
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe medical condition affecting the hand and locomotor function. New medical technologies, including various wearable devices, as well as rehabilitation treatments are being developed to enhance hand function in patients with SCI. As three-dimensional (3D) printing has the advantage of being able to produce low-cost personalized devices, there is a growing appeal to apply this technology to rehabilitation equipment in conjunction with scientific advances. In this study, we proposed a novel 3D-printed hand orthosis that is controlled by electromyography (EMG) signals. The orthosis was designed to aid the grasping function for patients with cervical SCI. We applied this hand exoskeleton system to individuals with tetraplegia due to SCI and validated its effectiveness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The 3D architecture of the device was designed using computer-aided design software and printed with a polylactic acid filament. The dynamic hand orthosis enhanced the tenodesis grip to provide sufficient grasping function. The root mean square of the EMG signal was used as the input for controlling the device. Ten subjects with hand weakness due to chronic cervical SCI were enrolled in this study, and their hand function was assessed before and after wearing the orthosis. The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Hand Function Test (TRI-HFT) was used as the primary outcome measure. Furthermore, improvements in functional independence in daily living and device usability were evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The newly developed orthosis improved hand function of subjects, as determined using the TRI-HFT (p < 0.05). Furthermore, participants obtained immediate functionality on eating after wearing the orthosis. Moreover, most participants were satisfied with the device as determined by the usability test. There were no side effects associated with the experiment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The 3D-printed myoelectric hand orthosis was intuitive, easy to use, and showed positive effects in its ability to handle objects encountered in daily life. This study proved that combining simple EMG-based control strategies and 3D printing techniques was feasible and promising in rehabilitation engineering.

233,Evaluation of wearable simulation interface for military training,"Objective:
        
      
      This research evaluated the training effectiveness of a novel simulation interface, a wearable computer integrated into a soldier's load-bearing equipment.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Military teams often use game-based simulators on desktop computers to train squad-level procedures. A wearable computer interface that mimics the soldier's equipment was expected to provide better training through increased realism and immersion.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A heuristic usability evaluation and two experiments were conducted. Eight evaluators interacted with both wearable and desktop interfaces and completed a usability survey. The first experiment compared the training retention of the wearable interface with a desktop simulator and interactive training video. The second experiment compared the training transfer of the wearable and desktop simulators with a live training environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results indicated the wearable interface was more difficult to use and elicited stronger symptoms of simulator sickness. There was no significant difference in training retention between the wearable, desktop, or interactive video training methods. The live training used in the second experiment provided superior training transfer than the simulator conditions, with no difference between the desktop and wearable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The wearable simulator interface did not provide better training than the desktop computer interface. It also had poorer usability and caused worse simulator sickness. Therefore, it was a less effective training tool.
    


          Application:
        
      
      This research illustrates the importance of conducting empirical evaluations of novel training technologies. New and innovative technologies are always coveted by users, but new does not always guarantee improvement.",3
234,Privacy-Preserving In-Bed Pose and Posture Tracking on Edge,"In-bed behavior monitoring is commonly needed for bed-bound patient and has long been confined to wearable devices or expensive pressure mapping systems. Meanwhile, vision-based human pose and posture tracking while experiencing a lot of attention/success in the computer vision field has been hindered in terms of usability for in-bed cases, due to huge privacy concerns surrounding this topic. Moreover, the inference models for mainstream pose and posture estimation often require excessive computing resources, impeding their implementation on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving in-bed pose and posture tracking system running entirely on an edge device with added functionality to detect stable motion as well as setting user-specific alerts for given poses. We evaluated the estimation accuracy of our system on a series of retrospective infrared (LWIR) images as well as samples from a real-world test environment. Our test results reached over 93.6% estimation accuracy for in-bed poses and achieved over 95.9% accuracy in estimating three in-bed posture categories.",7
235,Pneumatic Quasi-Passive Actuation for Soft Assistive Lower Limbs Exoskeleton,"There is a growing international interest in developing soft wearable robotic devices to improve mobility and daily life autonomy as well as for rehabilitation purposes. Usability, comfort and acceptance of such devices will affect their uptakes in mainstream daily life. The XoSoft EU project developed a modular soft lower-limb exoskeleton to assist people with low mobility impairments. This paper presents the bio-inspired design of a soft, modular exoskeleton for lower limb assistance based on pneumatic quasi-passive actuation. The design of a modular reconfigurable prototype and its performance are presented. This actuation centers on an active mechanical element to modulate the assistance generated by a traditional passive component, in this case an elastic belt. This study assesses the feasibility of this type of assistive device by evaluating the energetic outcomes on a healthy subject during a walking task. Human-exoskeleton interaction in relation to task-based biological power assistance and kinematics variations of the gait are evaluated. The resultant assistance, in terms of overall power ratio (Λ) between the exoskeleton and the assisted joint, was 26.6% for hip actuation, 9.3% for the knee and 12.6% for the ankle. The released maximum power supplied on each articulation, was 113.6% for the hip, 93.2% for the knee, and 150.8% for the ankle.",0
236,Automatic Functional Shoulder Task Identification and Sub-task Segmentation Using Wearable Inertial Measurement Units for Frozen Shoulder Assessment,"Advanced sensor technologies have been applied to support frozen shoulder assessment. Sensor-based assessment tools provide objective, continuous and quantitative information for evaluation and diagnosis. However, the current tools for assessment of functional shoulder tasks mainly rely on manual operation. It may cause several technical issues to the reliability and usability of the assessment tool, including manual bias during the recording and additional efforts for data labeling. To tackle these issues, this pilot study aims to propose an automatic functional shoulder task identification and sub-task segmentation system using inertial measurement units to provide reliable shoulder task labeling and sub-task information for clinical professionals. The proposed method combines machine learning models and rule-based modification to identify shoulder tasks and segment sub-tasks accurately. A hierarchical design is applied to enhance the efficiency and performance of the proposed approach. Nine healthy subjects and nine frozen shoulder patients are invited to perform five common shoulder tasks in the lab-based and clinical environments, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 87.11% F-score for shoulder task identification, and 83.23% F-score and 427 mean absolute time errors (milliseconds) for sub-task segmentation. The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method to support reliable evaluation for clinical assessment.",0
237,Methodology and Reporting of Mobile Heath and Smartphone Application Studies for Schizophrenia,"The increasing prevalence of mobile devices among patients of all demographic groups has the potential to transform the ways we diagnose, monitor, treat, and study mental illness. As new tools and technologies emerge, clinicians and researchers are confronted with an increasing array of options both for clinical assessment, through digital capture of the essential behavioral elements of a condition, and for intervention, through formalized treatments, coaching, and other technology-assisted means of patient communication. And yet, as with any new set of tools for the assessment or treatment of a medical condition, establishing and adhering to reporting guidelines-that is, what works and under what conditions-is an essential component of the translational research process. Here, using the recently published World Health Organization mHealth Evaluation, Reporting and Assessment guidelines for evaluating mobile health applications, we review the methodological strengths and weaknesses of existing studies on smartphones and wearables for schizophrenia. While growing evidence supports the feasibility of using mobile tools in severe mental illness, most studies to date failed to adequately report accessibility, interoperability, costs, scalability, replicability, data security, usability testing, or compliance with national guidelines or regulatory statutes. Future research efforts addressing these specific gaps in the literature will help to advance our understanding and to realize the clinical potential of these new tools of psychiatry.",2

239,A Regression-Based Framework for Quantitative Assessment of Muscle Spasticity Using Combined EMG and Inertial Data From Wearable Sensors,"There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The EMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grade for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community, and home-based rehabilitation.",0
240,Using a proximity detecting technology to nudge for physical distancing in a Swedish workplace during Covid-19: Retrospective Case study,"Background:
        
      
      The recent Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to the emergence of several technologies for infectious disease management. Although much focus has been placed on contact tracing applications, another promising new tactic is proximity tracing that focuses on health-related behavior and can be used for primary prevention. Underpinned by theories on behavioral design, a proximity detecting system can be devised that provides a user with immediate nudges to maintain physical distance to others. The practical feasibility of proximity detection during an infectious disease outbreak has not been sufficiently investigated. In this case study, a wearable proximity detecting technology was used in a workplace for 6 weeks, during the production of a music competition. The purpose of the technology was to nudge users into maintaining physical distance, using auditory feedback.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the feasibility of using a wearable device to nudge for distance, and to gather important insights about how the functionality and interaction were experienced by the users. The results from this study can guide future research and design efforts in this emerging technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective case study uses a mixed methods sequential approach including interviews (n=8) and a survey (n=30), to compile the experiences from using a wearable technology in a real life setting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Themes were generated from qualitative analysis based on data from interviews and survey open-text responses. The quantitative data was subsequently integrated into these themes: Feasibility (Implementation & Acceptance - Establishing a Shared Problem; Distance Tags in Context - Strategy, Environment and Activities; Understanding and Learning; Accomplishing the Purpose), and Design aspects (A Purposefully Annoying Device; Timing, Tone, and Proximity; Additional functions).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This empirical study reports on the feasibility of using a wearable technology based on proximity detection, to nudge individuals to maintain physical distance in a workplace. The technology supports an attention to distance, but the usability of this approach is dependent on context and situation. At certain situations, the audio signal is experienced as frustrating, but most users agree that it needs to be annoying to ensure a sufficient behavioral adaption. We propose a dual nudge that involves a vibration followed by a sound. There are indications that the technology also facilitates learning how to maintain a greater distance to others, and that this behavior can persist beyond the context of technology use. This study demonstrates that the key value of this technology is that it places the user in control and enables immediate action in a situation when distance to others is not maintained. The study contributes to insights within the emerging field of personal and wearable technologies used for primary preventive purposes during infectious disease outbreaks. Future research is needed to evaluate the preventive effect on transmission, and to investigate behavior change in more detail and in relation to different forms of feedback.",4
241,A Pivotal Study to Validate the Performance of a Novel Wearable Sensor and System for Biometric Monitoring in Clinical and Remote Environments,"Background:
        
      
      Increasingly, drug and device clinical trials are tracking activity levels and other quality of life indices as endpoints for therapeutic efficacy. Trials have traditionally required intermittent subject visits to the clinic that are artificial, activity-intensive, and infrequent, making trend and event detection between visits difficult. Thus, there is an unmet need for wearable sensors that produce clinical quality and medical grade physiological data from subjects in the home. The current study was designed to validate the BioStamp nPoint® system (MC10 Inc., Lexington, MA, USA), a new technology designed to meet this need.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the accuracy, performance, and ease of use of an end-to-end system called the BioStamp nPoint. The system consists of an investigator portal for design of trials and data review, conformal, low-profile, wearable biosensors that adhere to the skin, a companion technology for wireless data transfer to a proprietary cloud, and algorithms for analyzing physiological, biometric, and contextual data for clinical research.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on 30 healthy adult volunteers over the course of two continuous days and nights. Supervised and unsupervised study activities enabled performance validation in clinical and remote (simulated ""at home"") environments. System outputs for heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) (including root mean square of successive differences [RMSSD] and low frequency/high frequency ratio), activity classification during prescribed activities (lying, sitting, standing, walking, stationary biking, and sleep), step count during walking, posture characterization, and sleep metrics including onset/wake times, sleep duration, and respiration rate (RR) during sleep were evaluated. Outputs were compared to FDA-cleared comparator devices for HR, HRV, and RR and to ground truth investigator observations for activity and posture classifications, step count, and sleep events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty participants (77% male, 23% female; mean age 35.9 ± 10.1 years; mean BMI 28.1 ± 3.6) were enrolled in the study. The BioStamp nPoint system accurately measured HR and HRV (correlations: HR = 0.957, HRV RMSSD = 0.965, HRV ratio = 0.861) when compared to Actiheart<sup>TM</sup>. The system accurately monitored RR (mean absolute error [MAE] = 1.3 breaths/min) during sleep when compared to a Capnostream35<sup>TM</sup> end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitor. When compared with investigator observations, the system correctly classified activities and posture (agreement = 98.7 and 92.9%, respectively), step count (MAE = 14.7, < 3% of actual steps during a 6-min walk), and sleep events (MAE: sleep onset = 6.8 min, wake = 11.5 min, sleep duration = 13.7 min) with high accuracy. Participants indicated ""good"" to ""excellent"" usability (average System Usability Scale score of 81.3) and preferred the BioStamp nPoint system over both the Actiheart (86%) and Capnostream (97%) devices.

      The present study validated the BioStamp nPoint system's performance and ease of use compared to FDA-cleared comparator devices in both the clinic and remote (home) environments.",0
242,"A novel, hands-free ultrasound patch for continuous monitoring of quantitative Doppler in the carotid artery","Quantitative Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery has been proposed as an instantaneous surrogate for monitoring rapid changes in left ventricular output. Tracking immediate changes in the arterial Doppler spectrogram has value in acute care settings such as the emergency department, operating room and critical care units. We report a novel, hands-free, continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound patch that adheres to the neck and tracks Doppler blood flow metrics in the common carotid artery using an automated algorithm. String and blood-mimicking test objects demonstrated that changes in velocity were accurately measured using both manually and automatically traced Doppler velocity waveforms. In a small usability study with 22 volunteer users (17 clinical, 5 lay), all users were able to locate the carotid Doppler signal on a volunteer subject, and, in a subsequent survey, agreed that the device was easy to use. To illustrate potential clinical applications of the device, the Doppler ultrasound patch was used on a healthy volunteer undergoing a passive leg raise (PLR) as well as on a congestive heart failure patient at resting baseline. The wearable carotid Doppler patch holds promise because of its ease-of-use, velocity measurement accuracy, and ability to continuously record Doppler spectrograms over many cardiac and respiratory cycles.",5
243,Continuous Noninvasive Remote Automated Blood Pressure Monitoring With Novel Wearable Technology: A Preliminary Validation Study,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Included participants were ≥18 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were -0.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found that the Cloud DX's Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality.

244,See-Through Type 3D Head-Mounted Display-Based Surgical Microscope System for Microsurgery: A Feasibility Study,"Background:
        
      
      The surgical microscope is used primarily for microsurgeries, which are more complicated than other surgical procedures and require delicate tasks for a long time. Therefore, during these surgical procedures, surgeons experience back and neck pain. To solve this problem, new technology, such as wearable displays, is required to help surgeons maintain comfortable postures and enjoy advanced functionality during microsurgery.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to develop a surgical microscope system that would work with wearable devices. It would include a head-mounted display (HMD) that can offer 3D surgical images and allow a flexible and comfortable posture instead of fixed eyepieces of surgical microscope and can also provide peripheral visual field with its optical see-through function.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We designed and fabricated a surgical microscope system that incorporates a see-through type 3D HMD, and we developed an image processing software to provide better image quality. The usability of the proposed system was confirmed with preclinical examination. Seven ENT (ear, nose, and throat) surgical specialists and 8 residents performed a mock surgery-axillary lymph node dissection on a rat. They alternated between looking through the eyepieces of the surgical microscope and viewing a 3D HMD screen connected to the surgical microscope. We examined the success of the surgery and asked the specialists and residents to grade eye fatigue on a scale of 0 (none) to 6 (severe) and posture discomfort on a scale of 1 (none) to 5 (severe). Furthermore, a statistical comparison was performed using 2-tailed paired t test, and P=.00083 was considered significant.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although 3D HMD case showed a slightly better result regarding visual discomfort (P=.097), the average eye fatigue was not significantly different between eyepiece and 3D HMD cases (P=.79). However, the average posture discomfort, especially in neck and shoulder, was lower with 3D HMD display use than with eyepiece use (P=.00083).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We developed a see-through type 3D HMD-based surgical microscope system and showed through preclinical testing that the system could help reduce posture discomfort. The proposed system, with its advanced functions, could be a promising new technique for microsurgery.",0
245,Development of an Internet of Things Technology Platform (the NEX System) to Support Older Adults to Live Independently: Protocol for a Development and Usability Study,"Background:

          Objective:
        
      
      The NEX project aims to develop an integrated Internet of Things system coupled with artificial intelligence to offer unobtrusive health and wellness monitoring to support older adults living independently in their home environment. The primary objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the technical performance and user acceptability of the NEX system. The secondary objective is to apply machine learning algorithms to the data collected via the NEX system to identify and eventually predict changes in the routines of older adults in their own home environment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The NEX project commenced in December 2019 and is expected to be completed by August 2022. Mixed methods research (web-based surveys and focus groups) was conducted with 426 participants, including older adults (aged ≥60 years), family caregivers, health care professionals, and home care workers, to inform the development of the NEX system (phase 1). The primary outcome will be evaluated in 2 successive trials (the Friendly trial [phase 2] and the Action Research Cycle trial [phase 3]). The secondary objective will be explored in the Action Research Cycle trial (phase 3). For the Friendly trial, 7 older adult participants aged ≥60 years and living alone in their own homes for a 10-week period were enrolled. A total of 30 older adult participants aged ≥60 years and living alone in their own homes will be recruited for a 10-week data collection period (phase 3).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Phase 1 of the project (n=426) was completed in December 2020, and phase 2 (n=7 participants for a 10-week pilot study) was completed in September 2021. The expected completion date for the third project phase (30 participants for the 10-week usability study) is June 2022.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The NEX project has considered the specific everyday needs of older adults and other stakeholders, which have contributed to the design of the integrated system. The innovation of the NEX system lies in the use of Internet of Things technologies and artificial intelligence to identify and predict changes in the routines of older adults. The findings of this project will contribute to the eHealth research agenda, focusing on the improvement of health care provision and patient support in home and community environments.

246,Noise Detection in Electrocardiography Signal for Robust Heart Rate Variability Analysis: A Deep Learning Approach,"Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to assess the sympathetic and parasympathetic tones. However, the quality of the derived HRV features is heavily dependent on the accuracy of QRS detection. Noisy electrocardiography (ECG) signals, such as those measured by wearable ECG patches, can lead to inaccuracies in the QRS detection and significantly impair the HRV analysis. Hence, it is critical to employ noise detection algorithms to identify the corrupted segments of the ECG signal and discard them from the analysis. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network to distinguish between usable and unusable ECG segments where usability is defined based on the accuracy of QRS detection. The results indicate that the proposed method has significantly lower error rates compared to both the baseline method (HRV analysis on the noisy signals) and a noise detection method based on four ECG signal quality indices and a support vector machines classifier.",9
247,A Performance Evaluation Matrix for Measuring the Life Satisfaction of Older Adults Using eHealth Wearables,"eHealth wearables can track users' state of health, record their physiological data, and facilitate self-care. In this study, we examined whether they enhance older adults' casual exercise willingness and life satisfaction. After reviewing the related literature, the performance and satisfaction of elements for older adults to use eHealth Wearables were determined. The elements were derived from the means-end chain analysis. Three dimensions, product attributes, beneficial consequences, personal values, and responding elements, were identified first. The Performance Evaluation Matrix (PEM) was then established to determine the elements to be improved. A total of 250 questionnaires were distributed, out of which 206 valid questionnaires were completed and returned. In the proposed PEM, the product attributes that were in the priority improvement zone were accessibility, learnability, usability, affordability, positioning, pedometer, heart rate monitor, and data feedback. These elements are the most essential properties in need of improvement.",2
248,Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in Epilepsy: Protocol for a Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study,"Background:
        
      
      In recent years, a growing body of literature has highlighted the role of wearable and mobile remote measurement technology (RMT) applied to seizure detection in hospital settings, whereas more limited evidence has been produced in the community setting. In clinical practice, seizure assessment typically relies on self-report, which is known to be highly unreliable. Moreover, most people with epilepsy self-identify factors that lead to increased seizure likelihood, including mood, behavior, sleep pattern, and cognitive alterations, all of which are amenable to measurement via multiparametric RMT.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The primary aim of this multicenter prospective cohort study is to assess the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of RMT in the community setting. In addition, this study aims to determine whether multiparametric RMT collected in populations with epilepsy can prospectively estimate variations in seizure occurrence and other outcomes, including seizure frequency, quality of life, and comorbidities.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      People with a diagnosis of pharmacoresistant epilepsy will be recruited in London, United Kingdom, and Freiburg, Germany. Participants will be asked to wear a wrist-worn device and download ad hoc apps developed on their smartphones. The apps will be used to collect data related to sleep, physical activity, stress, mood, social interaction, speech patterns, and cognitive function, both passively from existing smartphone sensors (passive remote measurement technology [pRMT]) and actively via questionnaires, tasks, and assessments (active remote measurement technology [aRMT]). Data will be collected continuously for 6 months and streamed to the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-base (RADAR-base) server.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The RADAR Central Nervous System project received funding in 2015 from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under Grant Agreement No. 115902. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program and European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. Ethical approval was obtained in London from the Bromley Research Ethics Committee (research ethics committee reference: 19/LO/1884) in January 2020. The first participant was enrolled on September 30, 2020. Data will be collected until September 30, 2021. The results are expected to be published at the beginning of 2022.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RADAR Epilepsy aims at developing a framework of continuous data collection intended to identify ictal and preictal states through the use of aRMT and pRMT in the real-life environment. The study was specifically designed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the data collected via new technologies and compliance, technology acceptability, and usability for patients. These are key aspects to successful adoption and implementation of RMT as a new way to measure and manage long-term disorders.

249,Octopus: A Design Methodology for Motion Capture Wearables,"Human motion capture (MoCap) is widely recognised for its usefulness and application in different fields, such as health, sports, and leisure; therefore, its inclusion in current wearables (MoCap-wearables) is increasing, and it may be very useful in a context of intelligent objects interconnected with each other and to the cloud in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, capturing human movement adequately requires addressing difficult-to-satisfy requirements, which means that the applications that are possible with this technology are held back by a series of accessibility barriers, some technological and some regarding usability. To overcome these barriers and generate products with greater wearability that are more efficient and accessible, factors are compiled through a review of publications and market research. The result of this analysis is a design methodology called Octopus, which ranks these factors and schematises them. Octopus provides a tool that can help define design requirements for multidisciplinary teams, generating a common framework and offering a new method of communication between them.",2
250,Formative Assessment: Design of a Web-Connected Sedentary Behavior Intervention for Females,"Background:
        
      
      Sedentary behavior (SB) is a significant risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and early mortality, particularly among women, and the health consequences associated with SB are independent of physical activity status. Interventions utilizing wearable technologies can improve SB, but their effectiveness is influenced by individual preferences, device engagement strategies, and technological features, which may affect user compliance. Gathering a priori insight from target populations on their preferences for program tools and strategies may assist researchers in identifying effective methods to improve the efficacy of SB interventions.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to (1) explore the likeability (likes and dislikes) and usability (engagement intentions and navigation) of a wearable device (Movband) and its accompanying website (dashboard), (2) examine social incentive preferences (teammates), and (3) assess the feasibility (participants' experiences during an activity-monitoring period) of these tools for use in an intervention to reduce SB in girls and women.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 9 girls (mean age: 8.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 1.1 years) and 11 college-aged women (mean age: 22.6 years, SD 3.2 years) participated in this study. Separate focus groups were held for girls and women, and all participants attended one before and the other following a 7-day activity-monitoring period. During the focus groups, participants were prompted with questions to address the study aims, and the nominal group technique was used to compile lists of group-specific preferences for the activity-monitoring system. The top three ranking likes and dislikes were reverse coded to determine likeability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The top-ranking responses for the girls and women were the following: visual display of movements and ease of navigation (dashboard like), boring to look at and no calorie-tracking function (dashboard dislike), backlight and long battery life (Movband like), and color and not waterproof (tied for girls) and vertical time display (Movband dislike). Additionally, participants identified several aesthetic preferences and functional limitations. At the second focus group visit, the majority of the participants self-reported less SB during the previous week. Objective data from the activity-monitoring period revealed that the average steps per day for girls and women were 12,373.4 (SD 2617.6) and 8515.8 (SD 3076.7), respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that the girls and women liked many features of the Movband and dashboard. However, several dislikes were mentioned, which may negatively influence compliance and the effectiveness of the activity-monitoring system and require improvements before using in an SB intervention.",3
251,Data Collection Mechanisms in Health and Wellness Apps: Review and Analysis,"Background:
        
      
      There has been a steady rise in the availability of health wearables and built-in smartphone sensors that can be used to collect health data reliably and conveniently from end users. Given the feature overlaps and user tendency to use several apps, these are important factors impacting user experience. However, there is limited work on analyzing the data collection aspect of mobile health (mHealth) apps.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to analyze what data mHealth apps across different categories usually collect from end users and how these data are collected. This information is important to guide the development of a common data model from current widely adopted apps. This will also inform what built-in sensors and wearables, a comprehensive mHealth platform should support.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In our empirical investigation of mHealth apps, we identified app categories listed in a curated mHealth app library, which was then used to explore the Google Play Store for health and medical apps that were then filtered using our selection criteria. We downloaded these apps from a mirror site hosting Android apps and analyzed them using a script that we developed around the popular AndroGuard tool. We analyzed the use of Bluetooth peripherals and built-in sensors to understand how a given app collects health data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We retrieved 3251 apps meeting our criteria, and our analysis showed that 10.74% (349/3251) of these apps requested Bluetooth access. We found that 50.9% (259/509) of the Bluetooth service universally unique identifiers to be known in these apps, with the remainder being vendor specific. The most common health-related Bluetooth Low Energy services using known universally unique identifiers were Heart Rate, Glucose, and Body Composition. App permissions showed the most used device module or sensor to be the camera (669/3251, 20.57%), closely followed by location (598/3251, 18.39%), with the highest occurrence in the staying healthy app category.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found that not many health apps used built-in sensors or peripherals for collecting health data. The small number of the apps using Bluetooth, with an even smaller number of apps using standard Bluetooth Low Energy services, indicates a wider use of proprietary algorithms and custom services, which restrict the device use. The use of standard profiles could open this ecosystem further and could provide end users more options for apps. The relatively small proportion of apps using built-in sensors along with a high reliance on manual data entry suggests the need for more research into using sensors for data collection in health and fitness apps, which may be more desirable and improve end user experience.",6
252,A Gesture-Controlled Rehabilitation Robot to Improve Engagement and Quantify Movement Performance,"Rehabilitation requires repetitive and coordinated movements for effective treatment, which are contingent on patient compliance and motivation. However, the monotony, intensity, and expense of most therapy routines do not promote engagement. Gesture-controlled rehabilitation has the potential to quantify performance and provide engaging, cost-effective treatment, leading to better compliance and mobility. We present the design and testing of a gesture-controlled rehabilitation robot (GC-Rebot) to assess its potential for monitoring user performance and providing entertainment while conducting physical therapy. Healthy participants (n = 11) completed a maze with GC-Rebot for six trials. User performance was evaluated through quantitative metrics of movement quality and quantity, and participants rated the system usability with a validated survey. For participants with self-reported video-game experience (n = 10), wrist active range of motion across trials (mean ± standard deviation) was 41.6 ± 13° and 76.8 ± 16° for pitch and roll, respectively. In the course of conducting a single trial with a time duration of 68.3 ± 19 s, these participants performed 27 ± 8 full wrist motion repetitions (i.e., flexion/extension), with a dose-rate of 24.2 ± 5 reps/min. These participants also rated system usability as excellent (score: 86.3 ± 12). Gesture-controlled therapy using the GC-Rebot demonstrated the potential to be an evidence-based rehabilitation tool based on excellent user ratings and the ability to monitor at-home compliance and performance.",3
253,Technology-based methods for the assessment of fine and gross motor skill in children: A systematic overview of available solutions and future steps for effective in-field use,"The present review aims at providing researchers and practitioners with a holistic overview of technology-based methods for the assessment of fine and gross motor skill in children. We conducted a search of electronic databases using Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar, including studies published up to March 2020, that assessed fine and/or gross motor skills, and utilized technological assessment of varying study design. A total of 739 papers were initially retrieved, and after title/abstract screening, removal of duplicates, and full-text screening, 47 were included. Results suggest that motor skills can be quantitatively estimated using objective methods based on a wearable- and/or laboratory-based technology, for typically developing (TD) and non-TD children. Fine motor skill assessment solutions were; force transducers, instrumented tablets and pens, surface electromyography, and optoelectronic systems. Gross motor skill assessment solutions were; inertial measurements units, optoelectronic systems, baropodometric mats, and force platforms. This review provides a guide in identifying and evaluating the plethora of available technological solutions to motor skill assessment. Although promising, there is still a need for large-scale studies to validate these approaches in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and usability, where interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers and practitioners and transparent reporting practices should be advocated.",1
254,An upper body garment with integrated sensors for people with neurological disorders - early development and evaluation,"Background:
        
      
      In neurology and rehabilitation the primary interest for using wearables is to supplement traditional patient assessment and monitoring in hospital settings with continuous data collection at home and in community settings. The aim of this project was to develop a novel wearable garment with integrated sensors designed for continuous monitoring of physiological and movement related variables to evaluate progression, tailor treatments and improve diagnosis in epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and stroke. In this paper the early development and evaluation of a prototype designed to monitor movements and heart rate is described. An iterative development process and evaluation of an upper body garment with integrated sensors included: identification of user needs, specification of technical and garment requirements, garment development and production as well as evaluation of garment design, functionality and usability. The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration with experts from medical, engineering, textile, and material science within the wearITmed consortium. The work was organized in regular meetings, task groups and hands-on workshops. User needs were identified using results from a mixed-methods systematic review, a focus group study and expert groups. Usability was evaluated in 19 individuals (13 controls, 6 patients with Parkinson's disease) using semi-structured interviews and qualitative content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The garment was well accepted by the users regarding design and comfort, although the users were cautious about the technology and suggested improvements. All electronic components passed a washability test. The most robust data was obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors while the electrodes for heart rate registration were sensitive to motion artefacts. The algorithm development within the wearITmed consortium has shown promising results.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prototype was accepted by the users. Technical improvements are needed, but preliminary data indicate that the garment has potential to be used as a tool for diagnosis and treatment selection and could provide added value for monitoring seizures in epilepsy, fluctuations in PD and activity levels in stroke. Future work aims to improve the prototype further, develop algorithms, and evaluate the functionality and usability in targeted patient groups. The potential of incorporating blood pressure and heart-rate variability monitoring will also be explored.",4
255,JAKE® Multimodal Data Capture System: Insights from an Observational Study of Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Objective: To test usability and optimize the Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE®) system's components, biosensors, and procedures used for objective measurement of core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in clinical trials. Methods: A prospective, observational study of 29 children and adolescents with ASD using the JAKE system was conducted at three sites in the United States. This study was designed to establish the feasibility of the JAKE system and to learn practical aspects of its implementation. In addition to information collected by web and mobile components, wearable biosensor data were collected both continuously in natural settings and periodically during a battery of experimental tasks administered in laboratory settings. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02299700. Results: Feedback collected throughout the study allowed future refinements to be planned for all components of the system. The Autism Behavior Inventory (ABI), a parent-reported measure of ASD core and associated symptoms, performed well. Among biosensors studied, the eye-tracker, sleep monitor, and electrocardiogram were shown to capture high quality data, whereas wireless electroencephalography was difficult to use due to its form factor. On an exit survey, the majority of parents rated their overall reaction to JAKE as positive/very positive. No significant device-related events were reported in the study. Conclusion: The results of this study, with the described changes, demonstrate that the JAKE system is a viable, useful, and safe platform for use in clinical trials of ASD, justifying larger validation and deployment studies of the optimized system.",3
256,A Review of EEG and fMRI Measuring Aesthetic Processing in Visual User Experience Research,"In human-computer interaction, the visual interaction of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) plays an important role in enriching the quality of daily life. The purpose of our study analyzes the use of brain-computer interface (BCI), wearable technology, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the aesthetic processing of visual neural response to UI and UX designs. Specifically, this review aims to understand neuroaesthetic processing knowledge, aesthetic appreciation models, and the ways in which visual brain studies can improve the quality of current and future UI and UX designs. Recent research has found that subjective evaluations of aesthetic appreciation produce different results for objective evaluations of brain research analysis. We applied SWOT analysis and examined the advantages and disadvantages of both evaluation methods. Furthermore, we conducted a traditional literature review on topics pertaining to the use of aesthetic processing knowledge in the visual interaction field in terms of art therapy, information visualization, website or mobile applications, and other interactive platforms. Our main research findings from current studies have helped and motivated researchers and designers to use convincing scientific knowledge of brain event-related potential, electroencephalography, and fMRI to understand aesthetic judgment. The key trend finds that many designers, artists, and engineers use artistic BCI technology in the visual interaction experience. Herein, the scientific methods applied in the aesthetic appreciation to human-computer interface are summarized, and the influence of the latest wearable brain technology on visual interaction design is discussed. Furthermore, current possible research entry points for aesthetics, usability, and creativity in UI and UX designs are explicated. The study results have implications for the visual user experience research domain as well as for interaction industries, which produce interactive projects to improve people's daily lives.",3
257,"P-Ergonomics Platform: Toward Precise, Pervasive, and Personalized Ergonomics using Wearable Sensors and Edge Computing","Preventive healthcare has attracted much attention recently. Improving people's lifestyles and promoting a healthy diet and wellbeing are important, but the importance of work-related diseases should not be undermined. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among the most common work-related health problems. Ergonomists already assess MSD risk factors and suggest changes in workplaces. However, existing methods are mainly based on visual observations, which have a relatively low reliability and cover only part of the workday. These suggestions concern the overall workplace and the organization of work, but rarely includes individuals' work techniques. In this work, we propose a precise and pervasive ergonomic platform for continuous risk assessment. The system collects data from wearable sensors, which are synchronized and processed by a mobile computing layer, from which exposure statistics and risk assessments may be drawn, and finally, are stored at the server layer for further analyses at both individual and group levels. The platform also enables continuous feedback to the worker to support behavioral changes. The deployed cloud platform in Amazon Web Services instances showed sufficient system flexibility to affordably fulfill requirements of small to medium enterprises, while it is expandable for larger corporations. The system usability scale of 76.6 indicates an acceptable grade of usability.",0
258,Wearable Activity Tracker Use Among Australian Adolescents: Usability and Acceptability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers have the potential to be integrated into physical activity interventions, yet little is known about how adolescents use these devices or perceive their acceptability.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to examine the usability and acceptability of a wearable activity tracker among adolescents. A secondary aim was to determine adolescents' awareness and use of the different functions and features in the wearable activity tracker and accompanying app.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty adolescents (aged 13-14 years) in year 8 from 3 secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia, were provided with a wrist-worn Fitbit Flex and accompanying app, and were asked to use it for 6 weeks. Demographic data (age, sex) were collected via a Web-based survey completed during week 1 of the study. At the conclusion of the 6-week period, all adolescents participated in focus groups that explored their perceptions of the usability and acceptability of the Fitbit Flex, accompanying app, and Web-based Fitbit profile. Qualitative data were analyzed using pen profiles, which were constructed from verbatim transcripts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Adolescents typically found the Fitbit Flex easy to use for activity tracking, though greater difficulties were reported for monitoring sleep. The Fitbit Flex was perceived to be useful for tracking daily activities, and adolescents used a range of features and functions available through the device and the app. Barriers to use included the comfort and design of the Fitbit Flex, a lack of specific feedback about activity levels, and the inability to wear the wearable activity tracker for water-based sports.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Adolescents reported that the Fitbit Flex was easy to use and that it was a useful tool for tracking daily activities. A number of functions and features were used, including the device's visual display to track and self-monitor activity, goal-setting in the accompanying app, and undertaking challenges against friends. However, several barriers to use were identified, which may impact on sustained use over time. Overall, wearable activity trackers have the potential to be integrated into physical activity interventions targeted at adolescents, but both the functionality and wearability of the monitor should be considered.",3
259,"Designing wearable technologies for users with disabilities: Accessibility, usability, and connectivity factors","The increasing availability of wearable devices (wearables), ""smart"" home, and other next-generation wirelessly connected devices for work, home, and leisure presents opportunities and challenges for users with disabilities. As augmentative tools for engagement, control, and information, these technologies should not only be usable, but also be accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities. In order to better capture the dimensions of inclusivity of wearable devices, the authors have conducted a review of pertinent literature with respect to a range of representative applications and examples of currently available technologies. Drawing on the findings of the review, the aim of this article is to explore the potential impact of inclusive design principles on future device development for users with disabilities. These observations can help designers incorporate inclusive perspectives into the development process. Such an approach, where people with disabilities constitute an integral part of the development process, will yield products and services that can facilitate increased accessibility, independence, and community participation.",2
260,Assessing the Usability of a Novel Wearable Remote Patient Monitoring Device for the Early Detection of In-Hospital Patient Deterioration: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Patients admitted to general wards are inherently at risk of deterioration. Thus, tools that can provide early detection of deterioration may be lifesaving. Frequent remote patient monitoring (RPM) has the potential to allow such early detection, leading to a timely intervention by health care providers.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to assess the potential of a novel wearable RPM device to provide timely alerts in patients at high risk for deterioration.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective observational study was conducted in two general wards of a large tertiary medical center. Patients determined to be at high risk to deteriorate upon admission and assigned to a telemetry bed were included. On top of the standard monitoring equipment, a wearable monitor was attached to each patient, and monitoring was conducted in parallel. The data gathered by the wearable monitors were analyzed retrospectively, with the medical staff being blinded to them in real time. Several early warning scores of the risk for deterioration were used, all calculated from frequent data collected by the wearable RPM device: these included (1) the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), (2) Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Neurology, and Other (ABCNO) score, and (3) deterioration criteria defined by the clinical team as a ""wish list"" score. In all three systems, the risk scores were calculated every 5 minutes using the data frequently collected by the wearable RPM device. Data generated by the early warning scores were compared with those obtained from the clinical records of actual deterioration among these patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 410 patients were recruited and 217 were included in the final analysis. The median age was 71 (IQR 62-78) years and 130 (59.9%) of them were male. Actual clinical deterioration occurred in 24 patients. The NEWS indicated high alert in 16 of these 24 (67%) patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 29 hours on average. The ABCNO score indicated high alert in 18 (75%) of these patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 38 hours on average. Early warning based on wish list scoring criteria was observed for all 24 patients 40 hours on average before clinical deterioration was detected by the medical staff. Importantly, early warning based on the wish list scoring criteria was also observed among all other patients who did not deteriorate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Frequent remote patient monitoring has the potential for early detection of a high risk to deteriorate among hospitalized patients, using both grouped signal-based scores and algorithm-based prediction. In this study, we show the ability to formulate scores for early warning by using RPM. Nevertheless, early warning scores compiled on the basis of these data failed to deliver reasonable specificity. Further efforts should be directed at improving the specificity and sensitivity of such tools.

261,Associations Between Physiological Signals Captured Using Wearable Sensors and Self-reported Outcomes Among Adults in Alcohol Use Disorder Recovery: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Previous research has highlighted the role of stress in substance misuse and addiction, particularly for relapse risk. Mobile health interventions that incorporate real-time monitoring of physiological markers of stress offer promise for delivering tailored interventions to individuals during high-risk states of heightened stress to prevent alcohol relapse. Before such interventions can be developed, measurements of these processes in ambulatory, real-world settings are needed.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This research is a proof-of-concept study to establish the feasibility of using a wearable sensor device to continuously monitor stress in an ambulatory setting. Toward that end, we first aimed to examine the quality of 2 continuously monitored physiological signals-electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV)-and show that the data follow standard quality measures according to the literature. Next, we examined the associations between the statistical features extracted from the EDA and HRV signals and self-reported outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants (N=11; female: n=10) were asked to wear an Empatica E4 wearable sensor for continuous unobtrusive physiological signal collection for up to 14 days. During the same time frame, participants responded to a daily diary study using ecological momentary assessment of self-reported stress, emotions, alcohol-related cravings, pain, and discomfort via a web-based survey, which was conducted 4 times daily. Participants also participated in structured interviews throughout the study to assess daily alcohol use and to validate self-reported and physiological stress markers. In the analysis, we first used existing artifact detection methods and physiological signal processing approaches to assess the quality of the physiological data. Next, we examined the descriptive statistics for self-reported outcomes. Finally, we investigated the associations between the features of physiological signals and self-reported outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We determined that 87.86% (1,032,265/1,174,898) of the EDA signals were clean. A comparison of the frequency of skin conductance responses per minute with previous research confirmed that the physiological signals collected in the ambulatory setting were successful. The results also indicated that the statistical features of the EDA and HRV measures were significantly correlated with the self-reported outcomes, including the number of stressful events marked on the sensor device, positive and negative emotions, and experienced pain and discomfort.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results demonstrated that the physiological data collected via an Empatica E4 wearable sensor device were consistent with previous literature in terms of the quality of the data and that features of these physiological signals were significantly associated with several self-reported outcomes among a sample of adults diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. These results suggest that ambulatory assessment of stress is feasible and can be used to develop tailored mobile health interventions to enhance sustained recovery from alcohol use disorder.",4
262,An Open-Source Wireless Electrophysiological Complex for In Vivo Recording Neuronal Activity in the Rodent's Brain,"Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) are a widely used tool for recording neuronal activity both in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo experiments. In the last decade, researchers have increasingly used MEAs on rodents in vivo. To increase the availability and usability of MEAs, we have created an open-source wireless electrophysiological complex. The complex is scalable, recording the activity of neurons in the brain of rodents during their behavior. Schematic diagrams and a list of necessary components for the fabrication of a wireless electrophysiological complex, consisting of a base charging station and wireless wearable modules, are presented.",3
263,Resolving Long-Standing Uncertainty about the Clinical Efficacy of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to Relieve Pain: A Comprehensive Review of Factors Influencing Outcome,"Pain is managed using a biopsychosocial approach and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a technique whereby pulsed electrical currents are administered through the intact surface of the skin with the intention of alleviating pain, akin to 'electrically rubbing pain away'. Despite over 50 years of published research, uncertainty about the clinical efficacy of TENS remains. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to critically appraise clinical research on TENS to inform future strategies to resolve the 'efficacy-impasse'. The principles and practices of TENS are described to provide context for readers unfamiliar with TENS treatment. The findings of systematic reviews evaluating TENS are described from a historical perspective to provide context for a critical evaluation of factors influencing the outcomes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs); including sample populations, outcome measures, TENS techniques, and comparator interventions. Three possibilities are offered to resolve the impasse. Firstly, to conduct large multi-centered RCTs using an enriched enrolment with randomized withdrawal design, that incorporates a 'run-in phase' to screen for potential TENS responders and to optimise TENS treatment according to individual need. Secondly, to meta-analyze published RCT data, irrespective of type of pain, to determine whether TENS reduces the intensity of pain during stimulation, and to include a detailed assessment of levels of certainty and precision. Thirdly, to concede that it may be impossible to determine efficacy due to insurmountable methodological, logistical and financial challenges. The consequences to clinicians, policy makers and funders of this third scenario are discussed. I argue that patients will continue to use TENS irrespective of the views of clinicians, policy makers, funders or guideline panel recommendations, because TENS is readily available without prescription; TENS generates a pleasant sensory experience that is similar to easing pain using warming and cooling techniques; and technological developments such as smart wearable TENS devices will improve usability in the future. Thus, research is needed on how best to integrate TENS into existing pain management strategies by analyzing data of TENS usage by expert-patients in real-world settings.",4
264,The Unfolding Space Glove: A Wearable Spatio-Visual to Haptic Sensory Substitution Device for Blind People,"This paper documents the design, implementation and evaluation of the Unfolding Space Glove-an open source sensory substitution device. It transmits the relative position and distance of nearby objects as vibratory stimuli to the back of the hand and thus enables blind people to haptically explore the depth of their surrounding space, assisting with navigation tasks such as object recognition and wayfinding. The prototype requires no external hardware, is highly portable, operates in all lighting conditions, and provides continuous and immediate feedback-all while being visually unobtrusive. Both blind (n = 8) and blindfolded sighted participants (n = 6) completed structured training and obstacle courses with both the prototype and a white long cane to allow performance comparisons to be drawn between them. The subjects quickly learned how to use the glove and successfully completed all of the trials, though still being slower with it than with the cane. Qualitative interviews revealed a high level of usability and user experience. Overall, the results indicate the general processability of spatial information through sensory substitution using haptic, vibrotactile interfaces. Further research would be required to evaluate the prototype's capabilities after extensive training and to derive a fully functional navigation aid from its features.",3
265,A Meta-Learning Approach for Fast Personalization of Modality Translation Models in Wearable Physiological Sensing,"Modality translation grants diagnostic value to wearable devices by translating signals collected from low-power sensors to their highly-interpretable counterparts that are more familiar to healthcare providers. For instance, bio-impedance (Bio-Z) is a conveniently collected modality for measuring physiological parameters but is not highly interpretable. Thus, translating it to a well-known modality such as electrocardiogram (ECG) improves the usability of Bio-Z in wearables. Deep learning solutions are well-suited for this task given complex relationships between modalities generated by distinct processes. However, current algorithms usually train a single model for all users that results in ignoring cross-user variations. Retraining for new users usually requires collecting abundant labeled data, which is challenging in healthcare applications. In this paper, we build a modality translation framework to translate Bio-Z to ECG by learning personalized user information without training several independent architectures. Furthermore, our framework is able to adapt to new users in testing using very few samples. We design a meta-learning framework that contains shared and user-specific parameters to account for user differences while learning from the similarity amongst user signals. In this model, a meta-learner approximated by a neural network learns how to learn user-specific parameters and can efficiently update them in testing. Our experiments show that the proposed model reduces the percentage root mean square difference (PRD) by 41% compared to training a single model for all users and by 36% compared to training independent models for each user. When adapting the model to new users, our model outperforms fine-tuning a pre-trained model through back-propagation by 40% using as few as two new samples in testing.",0
266,An Objective Methodology for the Selection of a Device for Continuous Mobility Assessment,"Continuous monitoring by wearable technology is ideal for quantifying mobility outcomes in ""real-world"" conditions. Concurrent factors such as validity, usability, and acceptability of such technology need to be accounted for when choosing a monitoring device. This study proposes a bespoke methodology focused on defining a decision matrix to allow for effective decision making. A weighting system based on responses (n = 69) from a purpose-built questionnaire circulated within the IMI Mobilise-D consortium and its external collaborators was established, accounting for respondents' background and level of expertise in using wearables in clinical practice. Four domains (concurrent validity, CV; human factors, HF; wearability and usability, WU; and data capture process, CP), associated evaluation criteria, and scores were established through literature research and group discussions. While the CV was perceived as the most relevant domain (37%), the others were also considered highly relevant (WU: 30%, HF: 17%, CP: 16%). Respondents (~90%) preferred a hidden fixation and identified the lower back as an ideal sensor location for mobility outcomes. Overall, this study provides a novel, holistic, objective, as well as a standardized approach accounting for complementary aspects that should be considered by professionals and researchers when selecting a solution for continuous mobility monitoring.",4
267,User-Centered Design and Development of the Modular TWIN Lower Limb Exoskeleton,"For decades, powered exoskeletons have been considered for possible employment in rehabilitation and personal use. Yet, these devices are still far from addressing the needs of users. Here, we introduce TWIN, a novel modular lower limb exoskeleton for personal use of spinal-cord injury (SCI) subjects. This system was designed according to a set of user requirements (lightweight and autonomous portability, quick and autonomous donning and setup, stability when standing/walking, cost effectiveness, long battery life, comfort, safety) which emerged during participatory investigations that organically involved patients, engineers, designers, physiatrists, and physical therapists from two major rehabilitation centers in Italy. As a result of this user-centered process, TWIN's design is based on a variety of small mechatronic modules which are meant to be easily assembled and donned on or off by the user in full autonomy. This paper presents the development of TWIN, an exoskeleton for personal use of SCI users, and the application of user-centered design methods that are typically adopted in medical device industry, for its development. We can state that this approach revealed to be extremely effective and insightful to direct and continuously adapt design goals and activities toward the addressment of user needs, which led to the development of an exoskeleton with modular mechatronics and novel lateral quick release systems. Additionally, this work includes the preliminary assessment of this exoskeleton, which involved healthy volunteers and a complete SCI patient. Tests validated the mechatronics of TWIN and emphasized its high potential in terms of system usability for its intended use. These tests followed procedures defined in existing standards in usability engineering and were part of the formative evaluation of TWIN as a premise to the summative evaluation of its usability as medical device.",0
268,PKG Movement Recording System Use Shows Promise in Routine Clinical Care of Patients With Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating, neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly one million people. It's hallmark signs and symptoms include slow movements, rigidity, tremor, and unstable posture. Additionally, non-motor symptoms such as sleeplessness, depression, cognitive impairment, impulse control behaviors (ICB) have been reported. Today, treatment regimens to modify disease progression do not exist and as such, treatment is focused on symptom relief. Additionally, physicians are challenged to base their diagnoses and treatment plans on unreliable self-reported symptoms, even when used in conjunction to validated assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and clinical exams. Wearable technology may provide clinicians objective measures of motor problems to supplement current subjective methods. Global Kinetics Corporation (GKC) has developed a watch-device called the Personal KinetiGraph (PKG) that records movements and provides patients medication dosing reminders. A separate clinician-use report supplies longitudinal motor and event data. The PKG was FDA-cleared in September 2016. We studied 63 PD patients during 85 routine care visits in 2 US academic institutions, evaluating the clinical utility of the PKG. Patients wore a PKG for 6 continuous days before their visit. Next, PKG data was uploaded to produce a report. In clinic, physicians discussed PD symptoms with patients and conducted a motor examination prior to reviewing the PKG report and comparing it to their initial assessments. Lastly, patient, caregiver and physician satisfaction surveys were conducted by each user. Across all visits when patients did not report bradykinesia or dyskinesia, the PKG reported these symptoms (50 and 33% of the time, respectively). The PKG provided insights for treatment plans in 50 (79%) patients across 71 (84%) visits. Physicians found improved patient dialogue in 50 (59%) visits, improved ability to assess treatment impact in 32 (38%) visits, and improved motor assessment in 28 (33%) visits. Patients stated in 82% of responses that they agreed or strongly agreed in PKG training, usability, performance, and satisfaction. In 39% of responses, they also reported a very valuable impact on their care. PKG use in 63 PD patients within our clinical practice showed clinically relevant utility in many areas.",1
269,Exploratory Field Testing of Passive Exoskeletons in Several Manufacturing Environments: Perceived Usability and User Acceptance,"OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONSResults of the current exploratory study suggest that use of an exoskeleton (EXO) has the potential to be accepted by workers as an intervention in diverse manufacturing environments. Also evident were that the major factors contributing to EXO-use-intention are perceived comfort, task-technology fit, perceived safety, and perceived usefulness. A user's perception of perceived usability may be established by using an exoskeleton during actual job tasks, yet some aspects of perceived usability likely require multiple exposures to an EXO for an accurate assessment. Many negative comments regarding EXO use were related to physical constraints (e.g., restricted movements, bulkiness), and to the EXO interface (e.g., straps, cuff designs), suggesting a need for further research on EXO design to minimize discomfort. In practice, there is likely value in having workers use and explore candidate EXOs during their actual job, both to accurately assess the usefulness of an EXO and to find the most effective EXO.",3
270,Exoskeleton home and community use in people with complete spinal cord injury,"A consequence of a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) is the loss of gait capacity. Wearable exoskeletons for the lower extremity enable household and community ambulation in people with SCI. This study assessed the amount, purpose, and location of exoskeleton use in the home and community environment, without any restrictions. The number of steps taken was read from the exoskeleton software. Participants kept a daily logbook, and completed two user experience questionnaires (Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (D-QUEST) and System Usability Scale (SUS)). Fourteen people with a complete SCI used the ReWalk exoskeleton a median of 9 (range [1-15]) out of 16 ([12-21]) days, in which participants took a median of 3,226 ([330-28,882]) steps. The exoskeleton was mostly used for exercise purposes (74%) and social interaction (20%). The main location of use was outdoors (48%). Overall, participants were satisfied with the exoskeleton (D-QUEST 3.7 ± 0.4) and its usability (SUS 72.5 [52.5-95.0]). Participants with complete SCI report satisfaction with the exoskeleton for exercise and social interaction in the home and community, but report limitations as an assistive device during daily life.",3
271,Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano-Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID-19: A Visionary Road,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreak. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross-infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and antipathogen properties. Here, how to realize non-disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light-triggered self-disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli-responsive nanomaterials is outlined. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility of developing a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically driven and on-demand antipathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photothermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano-assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front-line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.",0
272,Neuroergonomic Assessment of Hot Beverage Preparation and Consumption: An EEG and EDA Study,"Neuroergonomics is an emerging field that investigates the human brain about behavioral performance in natural environments and everyday settings. This study investigated the body and brain activity correlates of a typical daily activity, hot beverage preparation, and consumption in a realistic office environment where participants performed natural daily tasks. Using wearable, battery operated and wireless Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors, neural and physiological responses were measured in untethered, freely moving participants who prepared hot beverages using two different machines (a market leader and follower as determined by annual US sales). They later consumed the drinks they had prepared in three blocks. Emotional valence was estimated using frontal asymmetry in EEG alpha band power and emotional arousal was estimated from EDA tonic and phasic activity. Results from 26 participants showed that the market-leading coffee machine was more efficient to use based on self-reports, behavioral performance measures, and there were significant within-subject differences in valence between the two machine use. Moreover, the market leader user interface led to greater self-reported product preference, which was further supported by significant differences in measured arousal and valence (EDA and EEG, respectively) during coffee production and consumption. This is the first study that uses a multimodal and comprehensive assessment of coffee machine use and beverage consumption in a naturalistic work environment. Approaches described in this study can be adapted in the future to other task-specific machine usability and consumer neuroscience studies.",1
273,Effectiveness of current perioperative telemonitoring on postoperative outcome in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery: A systematic review of controlled trials,"Background:
        
      
      Perioperative telemonitoring of patients undergoing major surgery might lead to improved postoperative outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of current perioperative telemonitoring interventions on postoperative clinical, patient-reported, and financial outcome measures in patients undergoing major surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For this systematic review, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for eligible articles published between January 1, 2009 and March 15, 2021. Studies were eligible as they described: (P) patients aged 18 years or older who underwent major abdominal surgery, (I) perioperative telemonitoring as intervention, (C) a control group receiving usual care, (O) any type of postoperative clinical, patient-reported, or financial outcome measures, and (S) an interventional study design.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search identified 2958 articles of which 10 were eligible for analysis, describing nine controlled trials of 2438 patients. Perioperative telemonitoring comprised wearable biosensors (n = 3), websites (n = 3), e-mail (n = 1), and mobile applications (n = 2). Outcome measures were clinical (n = 8), patient-reported (n = 5), and financial (n = 2). Results show significant improvement of recovery time, stoma self-efficacy and pain in the early postoperative phase in patients receiving telemonitoring. Other outcome measures were not significantly different between the groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Evidence for the effectiveness of perioperative telemonitoring in major surgery is scarce. There is a need for good quality studies with sufficient patients while ensuring that the quality and usability of the technology and the adoption in care processes are optimal.",6
274,Continuous Temperature-Monitoring Socks for Home Use in Patients With Diabetes: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Over 30 million people in the United States (over 9%) have been diagnosed with diabetes. About 25% of people with diabetes will experience a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime. Unresolved DFUs may lead to sepsis and are the leading cause of lower-limb amputations. DFU rates can be reduced by screening patients with diabetes to enable risk-based interventions. Skin temperature assessment has been shown to reduce the risk of foot ulceration. While several tools have been developed to measure plantar temperatures, they only measure temperature once a day or are designed for clinic use only. In this report, wireless sensor-embedded socks designed for daily wear are introduced, which perform continuous temperature monitoring of the feet of persons with diabetes in the home environment. Combined with a mobile app, this wearable device informs the wearer about temperature increases in one foot relative to the other, to facilitate early detection of ulcers and timely intervention.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      A pilot study was conducted to assess the accuracy of sensors used in daily wear socks, obtain user feedback on how comfortable sensor-embedded socks were for home use, and examine whether observed temperatures correlated with clinical observations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Temperature accuracy of sensors was assessed both prior to incorporation in the socks, as well as in the completed design. The measured temperatures were compared to the reference standard, a high-precision thermostatic water bath in the range 20°C-40°C. A total of 35 patients, 18 years of age and older, with diabetic peripheral neuropathy were enrolled in a single-site study conducted under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. This study evaluated the usability of the sensor-embedded socks and correlated the observed temperatures with clinical findings.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The temperatures measured by the stand-alone sensors were within 0.2°C of the reference standard. In the sensor-embedded socks, across multiple measurements for each of the six sensors, a high agreement (R2=1) between temperatures measured and the reference standard was observed. Patients reported that the socks were easy to use and comfortable, ranking them at a median score of 9 or 10 for comfort and ease of use on a 10-point scale. Case studies are presented showing that the temperature differences observed between the feet were consistent with clinical observations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We report the first use of wireless continuous temperature monitoring for daily wear and home use in patients with diabetes and neuropathy. The wearers found the socks to be no different from standard socks. The temperature studies conducted show that the sensors used in the socks are reliable and accurate at detecting temperature and the findings matched clinical observations. Continuous temperature monitoring is a promising approach as an early warning system for foot ulcers, Charcot foot, and reulceration.",0
275,Digital Assistive Technology to Support Everyday Living in Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia,"Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this review was to explore whether knowledge about and practice of technology for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (D) had developed since our 2017 review. Furthermore, we wanted to explore the usability and acceptability of technology in the newer trials, and how these may impact quality of life, occupational performance and human dignity.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We searched for primary studies published between 2017 and 2020 reusing medical subject heading (MeSH) terms in five databases - Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Amed and Cinahl - and obtained 1452 titles. The titles were divided in six piles, two for each of the three authors. The titles were sorted utilizing the Rayyan web tool. Fourteen studies were included in this review. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the studies examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This review included almost twice as many participants as in the 2007-2017 review. Since 2017, a shift seems to have occurred toward technologies that can be worn on the body to monitor body functions and report states, or imbalances. Moreover, research interest is now focused on mobile phone apps and wearables providing reminders and timely support, rather than on separate devices at home.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The studies conducted since 2017 report on wearable and environmental digital assistive technologies and often with multiple purposes. Three strategies for support seem evident: prompting and reminding people with dementia, monitoring people with dementia at home using environmental sensors and biosensors and providing safety outdoors. Thus, there is still a need for further research on the impact of technologies promoting occupational performance, quality of life, and human dignity for independent living.",4
276,Printable Solid-State Lithium-Ion Batteries: A New Route toward Shape-Conformable Power Sources with Aesthetic Versatility for Flexible Electronics,"Forthcoming flexible/wearable electronic devices with shape diversity and mobile usability garner a great deal of attention as an innovative technology to bring unprecedented changes in our daily lives. From the power source point of view, conventional rechargeable batteries (one representative example is a lithium-ion battery) with fixed shapes and sizes have intrinsic limitations in fulfilling design/performance requirements for the flexible/wearable electronics. Here, as a facile and efficient strategy to address this formidable challenge, we demonstrate a new class of printable solid-state batteries (referred to as ""PRISS batteries""). Through simple stencil printing process (followed by ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking), solid-state composite electrolyte (SCE) layer and SCE matrix-embedded electrodes are consecutively printed on arbitrary objects of complex geometries, eventually leading to fully integrated, multilayer-structured PRISS batteries with various form factors far beyond those achievable by conventional battery technologies. Tuning rheological properties of SCE paste and electrode slurry toward thixotropic fluid characteristics, along with well-tailored core elements including UV-cured triacrylate polymer and high boiling point electrolyte, is a key-enabling technology for the realization of PRISS batteries. This process/material uniqueness allows us to remove extra processing steps (related to solvent drying and liquid-electrolyte injection) and also conventional microporous separator membranes, thereupon enabling the seamless integration of shape-conformable PRISS batteries (including letters-shaped ones) into complex-shaped objects. Electrochemical behavior of PRISS batteries is elucidated via an in-depth analysis of cell impedance, which provides a theoretical basis to enable sustainable improvement of cell performance. We envision that PRISS batteries hold great promise as a reliable and scalable platform technology to open a new concept of cell architecture and fabrication route toward flexible power sources with exceptional shape conformability and aesthetic versatility.",0
277,Social Media Users' Perceptions of a Wearable Mixed Reality Headset During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Mixed reality (MR) devices provide real-time environments for physical-digital interactions across many domains. Owing to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, MR technologies have supported many new use cases in the health care industry, enabling social distancing practices to minimize the risk of contact and transmission. Despite their novelty and increasing popularity, public evaluations are sparse and often rely on social interactions among users, developers, researchers, and potential buyers.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study is to use aspect-based sentiment analysis to explore changes in sentiment during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as new use cases emerged in the health care industry; to characterize net insights for MR developers, researchers, and users; and to analyze the features of HoloLens 2 (Microsoft Corporation) that are helpful for certain fields and purposes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To investigate the user sentiment, we collected 8492 tweets on a wearable MR headset, HoloLens 2, during the initial 10 months since its release in late 2019, coinciding with the onset of the pandemic. Human annotators rated the individual tweets as positive, negative, neutral, or inconclusive. Furthermore, by hiring an interannotator to ensure agreements between the annotators, we used various word vector representations to measure the impact of specific words on sentiment ratings. Following the sentiment classification for each tweet, we trained a model for sentiment analysis via supervised learning.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results of our sentiment analysis showed that the bag-of-words tokenizing method using a random forest supervised learning approach produced the highest accuracy of the test set at 81.29%. Furthermore, the results showed an apparent change in sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic period. During the onset of the pandemic, consumer goods were severely affected, which aligns with a drop in both positive and negative sentiment. Following this, there is a sudden spike in positive sentiment, hypothesized to be caused by the new use cases of the device in health care education and training. This pandemic also aligns with drastic changes in the increased number of practical insights for MR developers, researchers, and users and positive net sentiments toward the HoloLens 2 characteristics.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our approach suggests a simple yet effective way to survey public opinion about new hardware devices quickly. The findings of this study contribute to a holistic understanding of public perception and acceptance of MR technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight several new implementations of HoloLens 2 in health care. We hope that these findings will inspire new use cases and technological features.",4
278,Monitoring of the central blood pressure waveform via a conformal ultrasonic device,"Continuous monitoring of the central-blood-pressure waveform from deeply embedded vessels, such as the carotid artery and jugular vein, has clinical value for the prediction of all-cause cardiovascular mortality. However, existing non-invasive approaches, including photoplethysmography and tonometry, only enable access to the superficial peripheral vasculature. Although current ultrasonic technologies allow non-invasive deep-tissue observation, unstable coupling with the tissue surface resulting from the bulkiness and rigidity of conventional ultrasound probes introduces usability constraints. Here, we describe the design and operation of an ultrasonic device that is conformal to the skin and capable of capturing blood-pressure waveforms at deeply embedded arterial and venous sites. The wearable device is ultrathin (240 μm) and stretchable (with strains up to 60%), and enables the non-invasive, continuous and accurate monitoring of cardiovascular events from multiple body locations, which should facilitate its use in a variety of clinical environments.",5
279,Supporting Surgical Teams: Identifying Needs and Barriers for Exoskeleton Implementation in the Operating Room,"Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to identify potential needs and barriers related to using exoskeletons to decrease musculoskeletal (MS) symptoms for workers in the operating room (OR).
    


          Background:
        
      
      MS symptoms and injuries adversely impact worker health and performance in surgical environments. Half of the surgical team members (e.g., surgeons, nurses, trainees) report MS symptoms during and after surgery. Although the ergonomic risks in surgery are well recognized, little has been done to develop and sustain effective interventions.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Surgical team members (n = 14) participated in focus groups, performed a 10-min simulated surgical task with a commercial upper-body exoskeleton, and then completed a usability questionnaire. Content analysis was conducted to determine relevant themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four themes were identified: (1) characteristics of individuals, (2) perceived benefits, (3) environmental/societal factors, and (4) intervention characteristics. Participants noted that exoskeletons would benefit workers who stand in prolonged, static postures (e.g., holding instruments for visualization) and indicated that they could foresee a long-term decrease in MS symptoms with the intervention. Specifically, raising awareness of exoskeletons for early-career workers and obtaining buy-in from team members may increase future adoption of this technology. Mean participant responses from the System Usability Scale was 81.3 out of 100 (SD = 8.1), which was in the acceptable range of usability.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Adoption factors were identified to implement exoskeletons in the OR, such as the indicated need for exoskeletons and usability. Exoskeletons may be beneficial in the OR, but barriers such as maintenance and safety to adoption will need to be addressed.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Findings from this work identify facilitators and barriers for sustained implementation of exoskeletons by surgical teams.",3
280,Generalized Deep Neural Network Model for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation with Photoplethysmogram Signal Only,"Due to the growing public awareness of cardiovascular disease (CVD), blood pressure (BP) estimation models have been developed based on physiological parameters extracted from both electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs). Still, in order to enhance the usability as well as reduce the sensor cost, researchers endeavor to establish a generalized BP estimation model using only PPG signals. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network model capable of extracting 32 features exclusively from PPG signals for BP estimation. The effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed model was evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard. Experimental results showed that the RMSEs in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are 4.643 mmHg and 3.307 mmHg, respectively, across 9000 subjects, with 80.63% of absolute errors among estimated SBP records lower than 5 mmHg and 90.19% of absolute errors among estimated DBP records lower than 5 mmHg. We demonstrated that our proposed model has remarkably high accuracy on the largest BP database found in the literature, which shows its effectiveness compared to some prior works.",1
281,Mobile health platform based on user-centered design to promote exercise for patients with peripheral artery disease,"Background:
        
      
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a cardiovascular disease that can be improved by risk factor modification. Mobile health (mHealth) intervention is an effective method of healthcare delivery to promote behavior changes. An mHealth platform can encourage consistent involvement of participants and healthcare providers for health promotion. This study aimed to develop an mHealth platform consisting of a smartphone application (app) synchronized with a wearable activity tracker and a web-based portal to support exercise intervention in patients with PAD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was conducted based on an iterative development process, including analysis, design, and implementation. In the analysis phase, a literature review and needs assessment through semi-structured interviews (n = 15) and a questionnaire-based survey (n = 138) were performed. The initial prototype design and contents were developed based on the users' requirements. In the implementation phase, multidisciplinary experts (n = 4) evaluated the heuristics, following which the mHealth platform was revised. User evaluation of the usability was performed by nurses (n = 4) and patients with PAD (n = 3).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Through the development process, the functional requirements of the platform were represented through visual display, reminder, education, self-monitoring, goal setting, goal attainment, feedback, and recording. In-app videos of exercise and PAD management were produced to provide information and in-app automatic text messages were developed for user motivation. The final version of the platform was rated 67.86 out of 100, which indicated ""good"" usability.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The mHealth platform was designed and developed for patients with PAD and their healthcare providers. This platform can be used to educate and promote individualized exercise among patients with PAD.",2
282,A Smart Shoe Insole to Monitor Frail Older Adults' Walking Speed: Results of Two Evaluation Phases Completed in a Living Lab and Through a 12-Week Pilot Study,"Background:
        
      
      Recent World Health Organization reports propose wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants' walking speed and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty evolution in both groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared to usual care.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study reports acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments.

283,Health Care Provider Perceptions of Consumer-Grade Devices and Apps for Tracking Health: A Pilot Study,"Background:
        
      
      The use of Web- or mobile phone-based apps for tracking health indicators has increased greatly. However, provider perceptions of consumer-grade devices have not been widely explored.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to determine primary care physicians' and advanced practice registered nurses' perceptions of consumer-grade sensor devices and Web- or mobile phone-based apps that allow patients to track physical activity, diet, and sleep.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a cross-sectional mailed survey with a random sample of 300 primary care physicians and 300 advanced practice registered nurses from Michigan, USA. Providers' use and recommendation of these types of technologies, and their perceptions of the benefits of and barriers to patients' use of the technologies for physical activity, diet, and sleep tracking were key outcomes assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most of the respondents (189/562, 33.6% response rate) were advanced practice registered nurses (107/189, 56.6%). Almost half of the sample (93/189, 49.2%) owned or used behavioral tracking technologies. Providers found these technologies to be helpful in clinical encounters, trusted the data, perceived their patients to be interested in them, and did not have concerns over the privacy of the data. However, the providers did perceive patient barriers to using these technologies. Additionally, those who owned or used these technologies were up to 6.5 times more likely to recommend them to their patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study demonstrated that many providers perceived benefits for their patients to use these technologies, including improved communication. Providers' concerns included their patients' access and the usability of these technologies. Providers who encountered data from these technologies during patient visits generally perceive this to be helpful. We additionally discuss the barriers perceived by the providers and offer suggestions and future research to realize the potential benefits to using these data in clinical encounters.",4
284,Effect of mouthguard design on retention and potential issues arising with usability in sport,"Background/aims:
        
      
      Mouthguard retention could potentially increase an athlete's motivation to wear the device, due to potential improvements in physical comfort. The aim of this study was to examine the retentive properties of selected customised mouthguard designs, during normal conditions (dry) and within the presence of artificial saliva (wet). Additionally, the correlation between thickness and retention was investigated.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Six different custom mouthguard designs (MG1-MG6) reported in previous studies, were pressure-formed with 2 and 4 mm blanks accordingly. Thickness was measured 10 times at seven anatomical points and the mean (±SD) was recorded. A novel rig was fabricated to connect the mouthguards to a Hounsfield H10KS Tensometer, which was used to fully displace each device from the model at a constant rate of 50 mm/min. The test was repeated under both dry and wet conditions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Retention forces recorded at the anterior region demonstrated higher measurements under wet conditions than dry (P < 0.001). The total retention of the mouthguards was influenced by alterations in their design. Trend analysis indicated that 64% of MG retention could be explained by their thickness under dry conditions and 55% when wet.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Design and thickness of mouthguards are key factors in retention. Mouthguard fabrication techniques should be considered in order to minimize dislodgment of the devices as well as potentially increasing the wearability of mouthguards during sport.",0
285,Self-healing and anti-freezing graphene-hydrogel-graphene sandwich strain sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity,"Hydrogels with specially designed structures and adjustable properties have been considered as smart materials with multi-purpose application prospects, especially in the field of flexible sensors. However, most hydrogel-based sensors have low sensitivity, which inevitably affects their promotion in the market. Herein, a strain sensor comprising a poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic acid) (PVA/PAA) hybrid hydrogel sandwiched between two graphene layers was successfully constructed in a facile way, and it exhibited many excellent properties including extremely high sensitivity. The incorporation of glycerol ensured the good flexibility and anti-freezing performance of the hydrogel-based sensor even at -15 °C. The dynamic coordination bonds in the hydrogel-based sensor endowed it with excellent self-healing properties. In particular, the sandwich-structured hydrogel sensor showed a very high gauge factor (GF) value of 39 at the strain of 50%, which is much higher than those of most ordinary hydrogel-based strain sensors. A super stable signal value after 5000 strain cycles and a very short response time of 274 ms guaranteed the long-term usability and sensitivity of the hydrogel-based sandwich sensor. More importantly, the hydrogel-based sandwich sensor could detect both large and tiny human motions accurately and instantly in a series of real-time monitoring experiments, showing great potential for intelligent wearable electronic devices.",0
286,A Usability Study of Physiological Measurement in School Using Wearable Sensors,"Measuring psychophysiological signals of adolescents using unobtrusive wearable sensors may contribute to understanding the development of emotional disorders. This study investigated the feasibility of measuring high quality physiological data and examined the validity of signal processing in a school setting. Among 86 adolescents, a total of more than 410 h of electrodermal activity (EDA) data were recorded using a wrist-worn sensor with gelled electrodes and over 370 h of heart rate data were recorded using a chest-strap sensor. The results support the feasibility of monitoring physiological signals at school. We describe specific challenges and provide recommendations for signal analysis, including dealing with invalid signals due to loose sensors, and quantization noise that can be caused by limitations in analog-to-digital conversion in wearable devices and be mistaken as physiological responses. Importantly, our results show that using toolboxes for automatic signal preprocessing, decomposition, and artifact detection with default parameters while neglecting differences between devices and measurement contexts yield misleading results. Time courses of students' physiological signals throughout the course of a class were found to be clearer after applying our proposed preprocessing steps.",0
287,"Usability, Acceptability, and Satisfaction of a Wearable Activity Tracker in Older Adults: Observational Study in a Real-Life Context in Northern Portugal","Background:
        
      
      The use of activity trackers has significantly increased over the last few years. This technology has the potential to improve the levels of physical activity and health-related behaviors in older adults. However, despite the potential benefits, the rate of adoption remains low among older adults. Therefore, understanding how technology is perceived may potentially offer insight to promote its use.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to (1) assess acceptability, usability, and user satisfaction with the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 in Portuguese community-dwelling older adults in a real-world context; (2) explore the mediating effect of the usability on the relationship between user characteristics and satisfaction; and (3) examine the moderating effect of user characteristics on the relationship between usability and user satisfaction.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Older adults used the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 over 15 days. The user experience was evaluated through the Technology Acceptance Model 3, System Usability Scale, and User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire. An integrated framework for usability and user satisfaction was used to explore user experience. Statistical data analysis included descriptive data analysis, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and mediation and moderation analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A sample of 110 older adults with an average age of 68.41 years (SD 3.11) completed the user experience questionnaires. Mean user acceptance was very high-perceived ease of use: 6.45 (SD 0.78); perceptions of external control: 6.74 (SD 0.55); computer anxiety: 6.85 (SD 0.47); and behavioral intention: 6.60 (SD 0.97). The usability was excellent with an average score of 92.70 (SD 10.73), and user satisfaction was classified as a good experience 23.30 (SD 2.40). The mediation analysis confirmed the direct positive effect of usability on satisfaction (β=.530; P<.01) and the direct negative effect of depression on usability (β=-.369; P<.01). Lastly, the indirect effect of usability on user satisfaction was higher in individuals with lower Geriatric Depression Scale levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Findings demonstrate that the Xiaomi Mi Band 2 is suitable for older adults. Furthermore, the results confirmed usability as a determinant of satisfaction with the technology and extended the existing knowledge about wearable activity trackers in older adults.",3
288,Perceived user preferences and usability evaluation of mainstream wearable devices for health monitoring,"Background:
        
      
      There are many problems with fitness trackers, such as device usability, which limit their large-scale application, and relevant studies are limited in terms of their sample size and evaluation methods. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the perceived usability of various mainstream fitness trackers on the market, and to learn about user feedback on feature preferences for each device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Trial use of seven mainstream fitness trackers (two smart watches and five smart wristbands) followed by a survey study were applied. The questionnaire was specifically developed for this study, which included two parts (user preferences and device usability in five dimensions). We recruited users to test the devices for at least 30 days and asked experienced users to provide feedback in order to evaluate each device, including the rating and user preference of each device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We received 388 valid questionnaires, in which users rated their responses on a five-point Likert scale. (1) User preference: the average user satisfaction was 3.50-3.86 (points), and the rating for willingness to buy averaged between 3.36 and 3.59. More users were willing to wear (58.3-81.3%) and purchase (56.8-83.0%) the devices than were not. The top three general feature preferences were daily activity tracking, heart health monitoring, and professional fitness tracking. The top three health-related feature preferences were heart rate monitoring, daily pedometer, and professional fitness tracking. (2) Usability evaluation: product design was rated from 3.57 to 4.00; durability, 3.63-4.26; ease of use, 3.70-3.90; added features, 3.30-3.83; and user-rated accuracy, 3.44-3.78. A significant difference was observed in the rating of product design and durability among the different devices (p < 0.05) score.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Users generally had positive subjective intent regarding fitness trackers but were less satisfied with their cost effectiveness. The users preferred health related features such as heart health monitoring, and professional fitness tracking. The rating of most of the current mainstream fitness trackers was fair with some significant differences among the devices. Thus, further improvement is needed.",3
289,Usability Evaluations of a Wearable Inertial Sensing System and Quality of Movement Metrics for Stroke Survivors by Care Professionals,"Background:
        
      
      Inertial motion capture systems are used in many applications such as measuring the movement quality in stroke survivors. The absence of clinical effectiveness and usability evidence in these assistive technologies into rehabilitation has delayed the transition of research into clinical practice. Recently, a new inertial motion capture system was developed in a project, called INTERACTION, to objectively measure the quality of movement (QoM) in stroke survivors during daily-life activity. With INTERACTION, we are to be able to investigate into what happens with patients after discharge from the hospital. Resulting QoM metrics, where a metric is defined as a measure of some property, are subsequently presented to care professionals. Metrics include for example: reaching distance, walking speed, and hand distribution plots. The latter shows a density plot of the hand position in the transversal plane. The objective of this study is to investigate the opinions of care professionals in using these metrics obtained from INTERACTION and its usability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      By means of a semi-structured interview, guided by a presentation, presenting two patient reports. Each report includes several QoM metric (like reaching distance, hand position density plots, shoulder abduction) results obtained during daily-life measurements and in clinic and were evaluated by care professionals not related to the project. The results were compared with care professionals involved within the INTERACTION project. Furthermore, two questionnaires (5-point Likert and open questionnaire) were handed over to rate the usability of the metrics and to investigate if they would like such a system in their clinic.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eleven interviews were conducted, where each interview included either two or three care professionals as a group, in Switzerland and The Netherlands. Evaluation of the case reports (CRs) by participants and INTERACTION members showed a high correlation for both lower and upper extremity metrics. Participants were most in favor of hand distribution plots during daily-life activities. All participants mentioned that visualizing QoM of stroke survivors over time during daily-life activities has more possibilities compared to current clinical assessments. They also mentioned that these metrics could be important for self-evaluation of stroke survivors.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The results showed that most participants were able to understand the metrics presented in the CRs. For a few metrics, it remained difficult to assess the underlying cause of the QoM. Hence, a combination of metrics is needed to get a better insight of the patient. Furthermore, it remains important to report the state (e.g., how the patient feels), its surroundings (outside, inside the house, on a slippery surface), and detail of specific activities (does the patient grasps a piece of paper or a heavy cooking pan but also dual tasks). Altogether, it remains a questions how to determine what the patient is doing and where the patient is doing his or her activities.",4
290,A novel upper-limb tracking system in a virtual environment for stroke rehabilitation,"Background:
        
      
      The transfer of the behaviors of a human's upper limbs to an avatar is widely used in the field of virtual reality rehabilitation. To perform the transfer, movement tracking technology is required. Traditionally, wearable tracking devices are used for tracking; however, these devices are expensive and cumbersome. Recently, non-wearable upper-limb tracking solutions have been proposed, which are less expensive and more comfortable. However, most products cannot track the upper limbs, including the arms and all the fingers at the same time, which limits the limb parts for tracking in a virtual environment and may lead to a limited rehabilitation effect.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this paper, a novel virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) was developed for upper-limb rehabilitation. The VRRS could track the motion of both upper limbs, integrate fine finger motion and the range of motion of the entire arm and map the motion to an avatar. To test the performance of VRRS, two experiments were designed. In the first experiment, we investigated the effect of VRRS on virtual body ownership, agency and location of the body and usability in 8 healthy participants by comparing it with a partial upper-limb tracking method based on a Leap Motion controller (LP) in the same virtual environments. In the second experiment, we examined the feasibility of VRRS in upper-limb rehabilitation with 27 stroke patients.

      VRRS improved the users' senses of body ownership, agency, and location of the body. The users preferred using the VRRS to using the LP. In addition, we found that although the upper limb motor function of patients from all groups was improved, the difference between the FM scores tested on the first day and the last day of the experimental group was more significant than that of the control groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A VRRS with motion tracking of the upper limbs and avatar control including the arms and all the fingers was developed. It resulted in an improved user experience of embodiment and effectively improved the effects of upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients.

291,"Low-Burden Mobile Monitoring, Intervention, and Real-Time Analysis Using the Wear-IT Framework: Example and Usability Study","Background:
        
      
      Mobile health (mHealth) methods often rely on active input from participants, for example, in the form of self-report questionnaires delivered via web or smartphone, to measure health and behavioral indicators and deliver interventions in everyday life settings. For short-term studies or interventions, these techniques are deployed intensively, causing nontrivial participant burden. For cases where the goal is long-term maintenance, limited infrastructure exists to balance information needs with participant constraints. Yet, the increasing precision of passive sensors such as wearable physiology monitors, smartphone-based location history, and internet-of-things devices, in combination with statistical feature selection and adaptive interventions, have begun to make such things possible.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this paper, we introduced Wear-IT, a smartphone app and cloud framework intended to begin addressing current limitations by allowing researchers to leverage commodity electronics and real-time decision making to optimize the amount of useful data collected while minimizing participant burden.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Wear-IT framework uses real-time decision making to find more optimal tradeoffs between the utility of data collected and the burden placed on participants. Wear-IT integrates a variety of consumer-grade sensors and provides adaptive, personalized, and low-burden monitoring and intervention. Proof of concept examples are illustrated using artificial data. The results of qualitative interviews with users are provided.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants provided positive feedback about the ease of use of studies conducted using the Wear-IT framework. Users expressed positivity about their overall experience with the framework and its utility for balancing burden and excitement about future studies that real-time processing will enable.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The Wear-IT framework uses a combination of passive monitoring, real-time processing, and adaptive assessment and intervention to provide a balance between high-quality data collection and low participant burden. The framework presents an opportunity to deploy adaptive assessment and intervention designs that use real-time processing and provides a platform to study and overcome the challenges of long-term mHealth intervention.",2
292,Current status and issues of the artificial pancreas: abridged English translation of a special issue in Japanese,"Surgical stress induces hyperglycemia and gives rise to glucose toxicity, which causes infectious diseases, resulting in unfavorable surgical outcomes. Intensive insulin treatment can control short- and long-term complications in patients with not only diabetes mellitus, but also surgical diabetes; however, it is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The wearable artificial pancreas was originally developed to control glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes, progressing to a device with enhanced stability and safety for these patients. Its usability has further progressed to include patients with type 2 diabetes. The bedside artificial pancreas is the only closed-loop-type artificial pancreas which can maintain stable glycemic control in accordance with a target blood glucose range, based on the patient's actual blood glucose levels. Moreover, this stable glycemic control with a low variation in blood glucose concentration within the target range is produced without any hypoglycemia. Significant advances of this device will now occur due to the approval of treatment for perioperative glycemic control by the Japanese Health Care Insurance System in 2016. Along with an increase in the number of mainly elderly patients with low glucose tolerance, it is expected that the role of the artificial pancreas will increase in the future. Considering the current state and expense of regenerative and transplant medicine, along with donor shortages, further development of the artificial pancreas and associated glycemic control can be expected.",0
293,Keppi: A Tangible User Interface for Self-Reporting Pain,"Motivated by the need to support those self-managing chronic pain, we report on the development and evaluation of a novel pressure-based tangible user interface (TUI) for the self-report of scalar values representing pain intensity. Our TUI consists of a conductive foam-based, force-sensitive resistor (FSR) covered in a soft rubber with embedded signal conditioning, an ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). In-lab usability and feasibility studies with 28 participants found that individuals were able to use the device to make reliable reports with four degrees of freedom as well map squeeze pressure to pain level and visual feedback. Building on insights from these studies, we further redesigned the FSR into a wearable device with multiple form factors, including a necklace, bracelet, and keychain. A usability study with an additional 7 participants from our target population, elderly individuals with chronic pain, found high receptivity to the wearable design, which offered a number of participant-valued characteristics (e.g., discreetness) along with other design implications that serve to inform the continued refinement of tangible devices that support pain self-assessment.",0
294,"The SHAPES Smart Mirror Approach for Independent Living, Healthy and Active Ageing","The benefits that technology can provide in terms of health and support for independent living are in many cases not enough to break the barriers that prevent older adults from accepting and embracing technology. This work proposes a hardware and software platform based on a smart mirror, which is equipped with a set of digital solutions whose main focus is to overcome older adults' reluctance to use technology at home and wearable devices on the move. The system has been developed in the context of two use cases: the support of independent living for older individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and the promotion of physical rehabilitation activities at home. Aspects such as reliability, usability, consumption of computational resources, performance and accuracy of the proposed platform and digital solutions have been evaluated in the initial stages of the pilots within the SHAPES project, an EU-funded innovation action. It can be concluded that the SHAPES smart mirror has the potential to contribute as a technological breakthrough to overcome the barriers that prevent older adults from engaging in the use of assistive technologies.",2
295,Myoelectrically Controlled FES to Enhance Tenodesis Grip in People With Cervical Spinal Cord Lesion: A Usability Study,"People with tetraplegia are often lacking grip strength, causing impairment in activities of daily living. For them, improving hand function is a priority because it is important for autonomy and participation in daily life. A tendon transfer surgery may be an option to improve the tenodesis grip, but it is an invasive procedure. Alternatively a similar effect can be produced, using a non-invasive method. We have previously described how myoelectrically controlled functional electrical stimulation (MeCFES) can be efficient for enhancing grip strength, using a one channel research prototype with wired connections to surface electrodes. In this paper we focus on the usability for activities of daily living and how it can fulfill an actual need. We recruited 27 participants with a cervical spinal cord lesion (C5-C7) for this trial. They tested the device in 12 sessions of 2 h each, in which the participants performed self selected activities involving the tenodesis grip. User centered outcomes were validated questionnaires: the Individually Prioritized Problem Assessment (IPPA) and the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST). Furthermore, they were asked if they found the device useful for continued use in daily life. The device facilitated prioritized activities for all participants. The IPPA change score was 4.6 on average (STD:3.5, effect size:1.3), meaning that the system greatly facilitated problematic tasks and the large effect size evinces that this was a meaningful improvement of hand function. It compares to the impact that a mobility device like a wheelchair has on daily living. Fourteen subjects found the system useful, expressing the need for such a neuroprosthesis. Examples of acquiring new abilities while using the device, indicate that the method could have a therapeutic use as well. Furthermore, results from the IPPA questionnaire are indicating what issues people with tetraplegia may hope to solve with a neuroprosthesis for the hand. The satisfaction of the device (QUEST) indicates that further effort in development should address wearability, eliminate wires, and improve the fitting procedure.",3
296,A dual-mode human computer interface combining speech and tongue motion for people with severe disabilities,"We are presenting a new wireless and wearable human computer interface called the dual-mode Tongue Drive System (dTDS), which is designed to allow people with severe disabilities to use computers more effectively with increased speed, flexibility, usability, and independence through their tongue motion and speech. The dTDS detects users' tongue motion using a magnetic tracer and an array of magnetic sensors embedded in a compact and ergonomic wireless headset. It also captures the users' voice wirelessly using a small microphone embedded in the same headset. Preliminary evaluation results based on 14 able-bodied subjects and three individuals with high level spinal cord injuries at level C3-C5 indicated that the dTDS headset, combined with a commercially available speech recognition (SR) software, can provide end users with significantly higher performance than either unimodal forms based on the tongue motion or speech alone, particularly in completing tasks that require both pointing and text entry.",3
297,Key Agreement Schemes in Wireless Body Area Networks: Taxonomy and State-of-the-Art,"Advances in wearable and implantable biosensors have enabled the applicability and usability of wireless body area networks (WBANs). A WBAN allows biosensors to collect and communicate human physiological data using wireless communication. The communication security of the collected data in WBAN is a major concern. Because of the dependability of cryptographic schemes for key management, these have become an important aspect of this security. However, the extremely constrained nature of biosensors has made designing key management schemes a challenging task. For this reason, many lightweight key management schemes have been proposed to overcome these constraints. In this article, we present a review of the state of the art of these solutions. We classify the WBAN schemes into three classes and evaluate them based on adequate metrics for key management in WBAN.",2
298,A qualitative evaluation of breast cancer survivors' acceptance of and preferences for consumer wearable technology activity trackers,"Background:
        
      
      Physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour are common amongst breast cancer survivors. These behaviours are associated with an increased risk of comorbidities such as heart disease, diabetes and other cancers. Commercially available, wearable activity trackers (WATs) have potential utility as behavioural interventions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour within this population.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of the study is to explore the acceptability and usability of consumer WAT amongst postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fourteen participants tested two to three randomly assigned trackers from six available models (Fitbit One, Jawbone Up 24, Garmin Vivofit 2, Garmin Vivosmart, Garmin Vivoactive and Polar A300). Participants wore each device for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout period before wearing the next device. Four focus groups employing a semi-structured interview guide explored user perceptions and experiences. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyse focus group transcripts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five themes emerged from our data: (1) trackers' increased self-awareness and motivation, (2) breast cancer survivors' confidence and comfort with wearable technology, (3) preferred and disliked features of WAT, (4) concerns related to the disease and (5) peer support and doctor monitoring were possible strategies for WAT application.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      WATs are perceived as useful and acceptable interventions by postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Effective WAT interventions may benefit from taking advantage of the simple features of the trackers paired with other behavioural change techniques, such as specialist counselling, doctor monitoring and peer support, along with simple manual instructions.",2
299,Efficacy of a Mobile Social Networking Intervention in Promoting Physical Activity: Quasi-Experimental Study,"Background:
        
      
      Technological interventions such as mobile apps, Web-based social networks, and wearable trackers have the potential to influence physical activity; yet, only a few studies have examined the efficacy of an intervention bundle combining these different technologies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to pilot test an intervention composed of a social networking mobile app, connected with a wearable tracker, and investigate its efficacy in improving physical activity, as well as explore participant engagement and the usability of the app.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a pre-post quasi-experimental study with 1 arm, where participants were subjected to the intervention for a 6-month period. The primary outcome measure was the difference in daily step count between baseline and 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included engagement with the intervention and system usability. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were conducted; posthoc subgroup analyses were carried out for participants with different levels of steps at baseline, app usage, and social features usage.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 55 participants were enrolled in the study; the mean age was 23.6 years and 28 (51%) were female. There was a nonstatistically significant increase in the average daily step count between baseline and 6 months (mean change=14.5 steps/day, P=.98, 95% CI -1136.5 to 1107.5). Subgroup analysis comparing the higher and lower physical activity groups at baseline showed that the latter had a statistically significantly higher increase in their daily step count (group difference in mean change from baseline to 6 months=3025 steps per day, P=.008, 95% CI 837.9-5211.8). At 6 months, the retention rate was 82% (45/55); app usage decreased over time. The mean system usability score was 60.1 (SD 19.2).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study showed the preliminary efficacy of a mobile social networking intervention, integrated with a wearable tracker to promote physical activity, particularly for less physically active subgroups of the population. Future research should explore how to address challenges faced by physically inactive people to provide tailored advices. In addition, users' perspectives should be explored to shed light on factors that might influence their engagement with the intervention.",3
300,A Systematic Review on Evaluation Strategies for Field Assessment of Upper-Body Industrial Exoskeletons: Current Practices and Future Trends,"With rising manual work demands, physical assistance at the workplace is crucial, wherein the use of industrial exoskeletons (i-EXOs) could be advantageous. However, outcomes of numerous laboratory studies may not be directly translated to field environments. To explore this discrepancy, we conducted a systematic review including 31 studies to identify and compare the approaches, techniques, and outcomes within field assessments of shoulder and back support i-EXOs. Findings revealed that the subjective approaches [i.e., discomfort (23), usability (22), acceptance/perspectives (21), risk of injury (8), posture (3), perceived workload (2)] were reported more common (27) compared to objective (15) approaches [muscular demand (14), kinematics (8), metabolic costs (5)]. High variability was also observed in the experimental methodologies, including control over activity, task physics/duration, sample size, and reported metrics/measures. In the current study, the detailed approaches, their subject-related factors, and observed trends have been discussed. In sum, a new guideline, including tools/technologies has been proposed that could be utilized for field evaluation of i-EXOs. Lastly, we discussed some of the common technical challenges experimenters face in evaluating i-EXOs in field environments. Efforts presented in this study seek to improve the generalizability in testing and implementing i-EXOs.",0
301,Differential effects of physical and psychological stressors on electrodermal activity,"Stress being labelled by WHO as ""the health epidemic of 21st century"" need to be treated as a clarion call for devising strategies that aim at its early detection, for the reason that stress is the cause as well as the catalyst for several chronic human health disorders. The work reported here in is a progression towards the development of a stress detection system based on the electrodermal activity (EDA) in humans, which can further be incorporated into a wearable vital signs monitor. The utility of EDA as a potential physiological measure for classifying physical and psychological stressors is analyzed in this paper. A group of 12 subjects (8 males and 4 females, age: 25.4 ± 3.1 years, mean ± SD) volunteered to participate in a laboratory stress task that included a psychological stressor close to real life work stress scenario and a physical stressor. The capability of stressors to elicit persistent stress response was validated by assessing variations in salivary cortisol levels. EDA was monitored throughout the experiment sessions as a measure of sympathetic activation in subjects. Six classification models were investigated concerning their usability to distinguish physical and psychological stressors based on EDA. A maximum accuracy of 95.1% was achieved using linear discriminat analysis (LDA) based classifier which imply that EDA is indeed a potential discriminate measure to classify physical and psychological stress responses. Furthermore, the best feature combination for maximum classification accuracy was also determined.",1
302,Long-Term Home-Monitoring Sensor Technology in Patients with Parkinson's Disease-Acceptance and Adherence,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a highly individual disease-profile as well as fluctuating symptoms. Consequently, 24-h home monitoring in a real-world environment would be an ideal solution for precise symptom diagnostics. In recent years, small lightweight sensors which have assisted in objective, reliable analysis of motor symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. While technical advances are important, patient acceptance of such new systems is just as crucial to increase long-term adherence. So far, there has been a lack of long-term evaluations of PD-patient sensor adherence and acceptance. In a pilot study of PD patients (N = 4), adherence (wearing time) and acceptance (questionnaires) of a multi-part sensor set was evaluated over a 4-week timespan. The evaluated sensor set consisted of 3 body-worn sensors and 7 at-home installed ambient sensors. After one month of continuous monitoring, the overall system usability scale (SUS)-questionnaire score was 71.5%, with an average acceptance score of 87% for the body-worn sensors and 100% for the ambient sensors. On average, sensors were worn 15 h and 4 min per day. All patients reported strong preferences of the sensor set over manual self-reporting methods. Our results coincide with measured high adherence and acceptance rate of similar short-term studies and extend them to long-term monitoring.",0
303,"Factors Affecting the Implementation, Use, and Adoption of Real-Time Location System Technology for Persons Living With Cognitive Disabilities in Long-term Care Homes: Systematic Review","Background:
        
      
      As the aging population continues to grow, the number of adults living with dementia or other cognitive disabilities in residential long-term care homes is expected to increase. Technologies such as real-time locating systems (RTLS) are being investigated for their potential to improve the health and safety of residents and the quality of care and efficiency of long-term care facilities.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to identify factors that affect the implementation, adoption, and use of RTLS for use with persons living with dementia or other cognitive disabilities in long-term care homes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English language literature indexed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from inception up to and including May 5, 2020. Search strategies included keywords and subject headings related to cognitive disability, residential long-term care settings, and RTLS. Study characteristics, methodologies, and data were extracted and analyzed using constant comparative techniques.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 12 publications were included in the review. Most studies were conducted in the Netherlands (7/12, 58%) and used a descriptive qualitative study design. We identified 3 themes from our analysis of the studies: barriers to implementation, enablers of implementation, and agency and context. Barriers to implementation included lack of motivation for engagement; technology ecosystem and infrastructure challenges; and myths, stories, and shared understanding. Enablers of implementation included understanding local workflows, policies, and technologies; usability and user-centered design; communication with providers; and establishing policies, frameworks, governance, and evaluation. Agency and context were examined from the perspective of residents, family members, care providers, and the long-term care organizations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is a striking lack of evidence to justify the use of RTLS to improve the lives of residents and care providers in long-term care settings. More research related to RTLS use with cognitively impaired residents is required; this research should include longitudinal evaluation of end-to-end implementations that are developed using scientific theory and rigorous analysis of the functionality, efficiency, and effectiveness of these systems. Future research is required on the ethics of monitoring residents using RTLS and its impact on the privacy of residents and health care workers.",2
304,Remote and Long-Term Self-Monitoring of Electroencephalographic and Noninvasive Measurable Variables at Home in Patients With Epilepsy (EEG@HOME): Protocol for an Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Epileptic seizures are spontaneous events that severely affect the lives of patients due to their recurrence and unpredictability. The integration of new wearable and mobile technologies to collect electroencephalographic (EEG) and extracerebral signals in a portable system might be the solution to prospectively identify times of seizure occurrence or propensity. The performances of several seizure detection devices have been assessed by validated studies, and patient perspectives on wearables have been explored to better match their needs. Despite this, there is a major gap in the literature on long-term, real-life acceptability and performance of mobile technology essential to managing chronic disorders such as epilepsy.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      EEG@HOME is an observational, nonrandomized, noninterventional study that aims to develop a new feasible procedure that allows people with epilepsy to independently, continuously, and safely acquire noninvasive variables at home. The data collected will be analyzed to develop a general model to predict periods of increased seizure risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 12 adults with a diagnosis of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and at least 20 seizures per year will be recruited at King's College Hospital, London. Participants will be asked to self-apply an easy and portable EEG recording system (ANT Neuro) to record scalp EEG at home twice daily. From each serial EEG recording, brain network ictogenicity (BNI), a new biomarker of the propensity of the brain to develop seizures, will be extracted. A noninvasive wrist-worn device (Fitbit Charge 3; Fitbit Inc) will be used to collect non-EEG biosignals (heart rate, sleep quality index, and steps), and a smartphone app (Seer app; Seer Medical) will be used to collect data related to seizure occurrence, medication taken, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All data will be collected continuously for 6 months. Standardized questionnaires (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and System Usability Scale) will be completed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the procedure. BNI, continuous wrist-worn sensor biosignals, and electronic survey data will be correlated with seizure occurrence as reported in the diary to investigate their potential values as biomarkers of seizure risk.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The EEG@HOME project received funding from Epilepsy Research UK in 2018 and was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee in March 2020. The first participants were enrolled in October 2020, and we expect to publish the first results by the end of 2022.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      With the EEG@HOME study, we aim to take advantage of new advances in remote monitoring technology, including self-applied EEG, to investigate the feasibility of long-term disease self-monitoring. Further, we hope our study will bring new insights into noninvasively collected personalized risk factors of seizure occurrence and seizure propensity that may help to mitigate one of the most difficult aspects of refractory epilepsy: the unpredictability of seizure occurrence.

305,Needs for aids and equipment for the management of epilepsy in an Australian cohort,"Aim:
        
      
      This paper investigated the bases of needs for a range of epilepsy aids and equipment and expressed concerns about the use of such devices.
    


          Method:
        
      
      There was a 29.6% response rate (n = 393 of 1328) to Wave 4 of the Australian Epilepsy Longitudinal Study (AELS). The focus of Wave 4 was on the expressed needs and affordability of aids and equipment for people with epilepsy (PWE) and quality of life (QoL). Quantitative analysis was used to examine the association between self-reported need for aids and equipment, sociodemographic information, and QoL. Open-ended responses were subject to qualitative analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Approximately one-fifth of the sample felt that they needed specific aids, including emergency ID bracelets, seizure alarms, and seizure monitors. Those respondents who felt that they needed aids had more frequent seizures, had been recently injured by a seizure, and were less prosperous. The QoL of those in need of equipment was lower than that of those who felt that they did not need it. Qualitative analysis revealed a need for more information about the aids available, issues associated with affordability, and some concern about the utility of these aids for those who lived alone.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Much research to date has focussed on the development and validation of devices for PWE and standards for testing. Fewer studies deal with the needs and experiences of PWE with regard to the use of such equipment. The development of these devices needs to ensure patient comfort and acceptability. In addition, there is a need to canvas the views of family, caregivers, and primary care providers on the usability of epilepsy aids and equipment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Further person-centered research is needed in assessing the need for and usability of aids and equipment for the management of epilepsy.",1
306,Users' Perceptions Toward mHealth Technologies for Health and Well-being Monitoring in Pregnancy Care: Qualitative Interview Study,"Background:
        
      
      Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women's monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to understand clinicians' and pregnant women's perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy.",2
307,Older Adults' Experience with a Novel Fall Detection Device,"Background:
        
      
      Falls are a significant concern for the older adult (OA) population, many of whom are unable to get up following a fall.
    


          Introduction:
        
      
      While many devices exist designed to detect a fall, little work has been conducted to evaluate the usability of such devices. We present a longitudinal usability study of a fall detection (FD) device tested with OAs in real-world settings.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      OAs were recruited and asked to use a wearable FD device for up to 4 months. Participants were interviewed at baseline and 2 and 4 months and encouraged to provide direct feedback on their experience.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 18 OAs participated in the study. Eight completed the 4-month trial. We conducted a total of 38 interviews (16 baseline, 7 midpoint, and 15 final) and logged a total of 78 comments. While participants enjoyed the GPS and automatic detection features of the device, they were unhappy with the volume of false alarms and obtrusiveness of the device. Many also did not see a great need for having the device or were embarrassed by the device.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Engineers must work to better develop this technology so that it is accessible to people with hearing loss, limited dexterity, and low vision. Utilizing age-appropriate design techniques will help make such informatics tools more user friendly.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We explored the usability of a particular FD device with OAs and provide design recommendations to help future device manufacturers create more age-appropriate devices.",2
308,"Mobile Postoperative Symptom Intervention Tool and Biometric Monitoring After Radical Cystectomy: Pilot Study Evaluating Feasibility, Usability, and Potential Utility","Purpose:
        
      
      Mobile health technology and integration of patient-reported outcome measures into clinical interventions have the potential to transform patient care. Though patient-reported outcome measure management has been shown to improve outcomes in ambulatory care settings, few studies have examined remote patient-reported outcome measure assessment after major cancer surgery.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A multiphased feasibility and usability study was designed. A mobile app-based postoperative symptom intervention tool was developed and evaluated by a focus group of bladder cancer patients and caregivers. Patients were prospectively accrued prior to cystectomy and asked to complete the daily mobile postoperative symptom intervention tool and wear biometric monitoring devices for 30 days post discharge. Retention, postoperative symptom intervention tool completion, and usability were assessed. Exploratory analysis of daily symptoms and patient-generated health information correlated signals with postsurgical complications and hospital readmission.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen patients with a median age of 72 years completed 78% of daily surveys over the 30-day recovery period. Average time to complete the postoperative symptom intervention tool was 152 seconds. All patients agreed that the daily survey was easy to use, and most reported it would be a better way to communicate with the care team about symptoms than calling the clinic. Frequency and severity of patient-reported symptoms appeared to cluster prior to or at the time of complication or unplanned health care encounters on visual-analogue mapping.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using smartphone and wearable technology to capture patient-reported symptoms and biometric data is feasible and rated as highly usable by bladder cancer patients after cystectomy. Symptom scores may signal developing complications and help clinicians identify postsurgical patients who may benefit from intervention.",6
309,Electrochemiluminescent sensors as a screening strategy for psychoactive substances within biological matrices,"With the rapid growth and appearance of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) onto the global drug market, the need for alternative screening methodologies for implementation within clinical environments is substantial. The immunoassay methods currently in use are inadequate for this new drug trend with the potential for misdiagnosis and subsequent administration of incorrect patient treatment increased. This contribution illustrates a strong proof-of-concept for the use of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) as a screening methodology for NPS within biological fluids, using the hallucinogen scopolamine as a model compound. A low cost, easy-to-use and portable sensor has been developed and successfully employed for the detection of scopolamine at clinically relevant concentrations within a variety of biological matrices, including human pooled serum, urine, artificial saliva and sweat, without any prior sample preparation required. Moreover, assessment of the sensor's potential as a point-of-care wearable device was performed with sample collection from the surface of skin, demonstrating its capability for the qualitative identification of scopolamine despite collection of only minimal volumes off the skins surface. The developed sensor described herein exhibits a strong proof-of-concept for the employment of such ECL sensors as point-of-care devices, where the sensors ease of use and removal of time-consuming and complex sample preparation methods will ultimately increase its usability by physicians, widening the avenues where ECL sensors could be employed.",4
310,The Effectiveness of a Web-Based Computer-Tailored Physical Activity Intervention Using Fitbit Activity Trackers: Randomized Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Web-based interventions that provide personalized physical activity advice have demonstrated good effectiveness but rely on self-reported measures of physical activity, which are prone to overreporting, potentially reducing the accuracy and effectiveness of the advice provided.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to examine whether the effectiveness of a Web-based computer-tailored intervention could be improved by integrating Fitbit activity trackers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants received the 3-month TaylorActive intervention, which included 8 modules of theory-based, personally tailored physical activity advice and action planning. Participants were randomized to receive the same intervention either with or without Fitbit tracker integration. All intervention materials were delivered on the Web, and there was no face-to-face contact at any time point. Changes in physical activity (Active Australia Survey), sitting time (Workforce Sitting Questionnaire), and body mass index (BMI) were assessed 1 and 3 months post baseline. Advice acceptability, website usability, and module completion were also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 243 Australian adults participated. Linear mixed model analyses showed a significant increase in total weekly physical activity (adjusted mean increase=163.2; 95% CI 52.0-274.5; P=.004) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (adjusted mean increase=78.6; 95% CI 24.4-131.9; P=.004) in the Fitbit group compared with the non-Fitbit group at the 3-month follow-up. The sitting time and BMI decreased more in the Fitbit group, but no significant group × time interaction effects were found. The physical activity advice acceptability and the website usability were consistently rated higher by participants in the Fitbit group. Non-Fitbit group participants completed 2.9 (SD 2.5) modules, and Fitbit group participants completed 4.4 (SD 3.1) modules.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Integrating physical activity trackers into a Web-based computer-tailored intervention significantly increased intervention effectiveness.

311,"On-body calibration and measurements using a personal, distributed exposimeter for wireless fidelity","This paper describes the design, calibration, and measurements with a personal, distributed exposimeter (PDE) for the on-body detection of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields due to Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) networks. Numerical simulations show that using a combination of two RF nodes placed on the front and back of the body reduces the 50% prediction interval (PI50) on the incident free-space electric-field strength (Equation is included in full-text article.). Median reductions of 10 dB and 9.1 dB are obtained compared to the PI50 of a single antenna placed on the body using a weighted arithmetic and geometric average, respectively. Therefore, a simple PDE topology based on two nodes, which are deployed on opposite sides of the human torso, is applied for calibration and measurements. The PDE is constructed using flexible, dual-polarized textile antennas and wearable electronics, which communicate wirelessly with a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connected receiver and can be unobtrusively integrated into a garment. The calibration of the PDE in an anechoic chamber proves that the PI50 of the measured (Equation is included in full-text article.)is reduced to 3.2 dB. To demonstrate the real-life usability of the wireless device, a subject was equipped with the PDE during a walk in the city of Ghent, Belgium. Using a sample frequency of 2 Hz, an average incident power density of 59 nW m was registered in the WiFi frequency band during this walk.",0
312,Home rehabilitation supported by a wearable soft-robotic device for improving hand function in older adults: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      New developments, based on the concept of wearable soft-robotic devices, make it possible to support impaired hand function during the performance of daily activities and intensive task-specific training. The wearable soft-robotic ironHand glove is such a system that supports grip strength during the performance of daily activities and hand training exercises at home.
    


          Design:
        
      
      This pilot randomized controlled clinical study explored the effect of prolonged use of the assistive ironHand glove during daily activities at home, in comparison to its use as a trainings tool at home, on functional performance of the hand.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 91 older adults with self-perceived decline of hand function participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to a 4-weeks intervention of either assistive or therapeutic ironHand use, or control group (received no additional exercise or treatment). All participants performed a maximal pinch grip test, Box and Blocks test (BBT), Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) at baseline and after 4-weeks of intervention. Only participants of the assistive and therapeutic group completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) after the intervention period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants of the assistive and therapeutic group reported high scores on the SUS (mean = 73, SEM = 2). The therapeutic group showed improvements in unsupported handgrip strength (mean Δ = 3) and pinch strength (mean Δ = 0.5) after 4 weeks of ironHand use (p≤0.039). Scores on the BBT and JTHFT improved not only after 4 weeks of ironHand use (assistive and therapeutic), but also in the control group. Only handgrip strength improved more in the therapeutic group compared to the assistive and control group. No significant correlations were found between changes in performance and assistive or therapeutic ironHand use (p≥0.062).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study showed that support of the wearable soft-robotic ironHand system either as assistive device or as training tool may be a promising way to counter functional hand function decline associated with ageing.",5
313,Sleeve for Knee Angle Monitoring: An IMU-POF Sensor Fusion System,"The knee flexion-extension angle is an important variable to be monitored in various clinical scenarios, for example, during physical rehabilitation assessment. The purpose of this work is to develop and validate a sensor fusion system based on a knee sleeve for monitoring of physical therapy. The system consists of merging data from two inertial measurement units (IMUs) and an intensity-variation based Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) curvature sensor using a quaternion-based Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF). The proposed data fusion method is magnetometer-free and deals with sensors' uncertainties through reliability intervals defined during gait. Walking trials were performed by twelve healthy participants using our knee sleeve system and results were validated against a gold standard motion capture system. Additionally, a comparison with other three knee angle estimation methods, which are exclusively based on IMUs, was carried out. The proposed system presented better performance (mean RMSE 3.3 °, LFM coefficients, a1 = 0.99 ± 0.04, a0 = 0.70 ± 2.29, R2 = 0.98 ± 0.01 and ρC 0.99) when compared to the other evaluated methods. Experimental results demonstrate the usability and feasibility of our system to estimate knee motion with high accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility. This wearable system may be suitable for motion assessment in rehabilitation labs in future studies.",5
314,Comparing the Usability and Acceptability of Wearable Sensors Among Older Irish Adults in a Real-World Context: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable devices are valuable assessment tools for patient outcomes in contexts such as clinical trials. To be successfully deployed, however, participants must be willing to wear them. Another concern is that usability studies are rarely published, often fail to test devices beyond 24 hours, and need to be repeated frequently to ensure that contemporary devices are assessed.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to compare multiple wearable sensors in a real-world context to establish their usability within an older adult (>50 years) population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight older adults wore seven devices for a minimum of 1 week each: Actigraph GT9x, Actibelt, Actiwatch, Biovotion, Hexoskin, Mc10 Biostamp_RC, and Wavelet. Usability was established through mixed methods using semistructured interviews and three questionnaires, namely, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), the System Usability Scale (SUS), and an acceptability questionnaire. Quantitative data were reported descriptively and qualitative data were analyzed using deductive content analysis. Data were then integrated using triangulation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results demonstrated that no device was considered optimal as all scored below average in the SUS (median, IQR; min-max=57.5, 12.5; 47.5-63.8). Hexoskin was the lowest scored device based on the IMI (3.6; 3.4-4.5), while Biovotion, Actibelt, and Mc10 Biostamp_RC achieved the highest median results on the acceptability questionnaire (3.6 on a 6-point Likert scale). Qualitatively, participants were willing to accept less comfort, less device discretion, and high charging burdens if the devices were perceived as useful, namely through the provision of feedback for the user. Participants agreed that the purpose of use is a key enabler for long-term compliance. These views were particularly noted by those not currently wearing an activity-tracking device. Participants believed that wrist-worn sensors were the most versatile and easy to use, and therefore, the most suitable for long-term use. In particular, Actiwatch and Wavelet stood out for their comfort. The convergence of quantitative and qualitative data was demonstrated in the study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Based on the results, the following context-specific recommendations can be made: (1) researchers should consider their device selection in relation to both individual and environmental factors, and not simply the primary outcome of the research study; (2) if researchers do not wish their participants to have access to feedback from the devices, then a simple, wrist-worn device that acts as a watch is preferable; (3) if feedback is allowed, then it should be made available to help participants remain engaged; this is likely to apply only to people without cognitive impairments; (4) battery life of 1 week should be considered as a necessary feature to enhance data capture; (5) researchers should consider providing additional information about the purpose of devices to participants to support their continued use.",3
315,Occupational therapists' evaluation of the perceived usability and utility of wearable soft robotic exoskeleton gloves for hand function rehabilitation following a stroke,"Purpose:
        
      
      To evaluate the perceived usability and utility of using a soft robotic glove to rehabilitate hand function following a stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to consult a convenience sample of 14 experienced occupational therapists (OTs) practicing within a specialised stroke rehabilitation program. All OTs participated in one 60-to-90-minute individual consultation during which the attributes of a recently-developed soft robotic glove (ExoGlove) were presented before they could test it on themselves. After this consultation, OTs completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and answered open-ended questions focussing on the usability and utility of soft robotic gloves framed according to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The OTs perceived the glove's usability as being moderate-to-good on the SUS (median score= 63.75 on a scale of 100). Thematic analysis revealed the importance of specifically considering elements such as ease of use (e.g. simplicity and speed), cost, movement precision, durability, and safety, when developing soft robotic gloves such as the ExoGlove.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Engagement in a continuous improvement process is essential to maximise the perceived usability and utility of soft robotic gloves, particularly of the ExoGlove, through their final development phase before pilot testing their effects and effectiveness for post-stroke hand rehabilitation.Implications for rehabilitationAll occupational therapists anticipate that a soft robotic glove such as the ExoGlove will allow them to increase treatment intensity and best aligns with principles of neuroplasticity.The clinical judgement and guidance of OTs, developed through practice, experience, and knowledge, remain essential to safely and efficiently exercise with a soft robotic glove.Achieving a balance between effort and performance expectancies is essential in developing and improving the functionality of soft robotic gloves, as with each additional functionality comes new challenges that impact its successful transition to a clinical setting.",5
316,A Biofeedback App for Migraine: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Biofeedback is effective in treating migraines. It is believed to have a beneficial effect on autonomous nervous system activity and render individuals resilient to stressors that may trigger a migraine. However, widespread use of biofeedback is hampered by the need for a trained therapist and specialized equipment. Emerging digital health technology, including smartphones and wearables (mHealth), enables new ways of administering biofeedback. Currently, mHealth interventions for migraine appear feasible, but development processes and usability testing remain insufficient.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to evaluate and improve the feasibility and usability of an mHealth biofeedback treatment app for adults with migraine.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a prospective development and usability study, 18 adults with migraine completed a 4-week testing period of self-administered therapist-independent biofeedback treatment consisting of a smartphone app connected to wearable sensors (Cerebri, Nordic Brain Tech AS). The app included biofeedback training, instructions for self-delivery, and a headache diary. Two wearable sensors were used to measure surface electromyographic voltage at the trapezius muscle and peripheral skin temperature and heart rate at the right second fingertip. Participants were instructed to complete a daily headache diary entry and biofeedback session of 10 minutes duration. The testing period was preceded by a preusability expectation interview and succeeded by a postusability experience interview. In addition, an evaluation questionnaire was completed at weeks 2 and 4. Adherence was calculated as the proportion of 10-minute sessions completed within the first 28 days of treatment. Usability and feasibility were analyzed and summarized quantitatively and qualitatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 391 biofeedback sessions were completed with a median of 25 (IQR 17-28) per participant. The mean adherence rate was 0.76 (SD 0.26). The evaluation questionnaire revealed that functionality and design had the highest scores, whereas engagement and biofeedback were lower. Qualitative preexpectation analysis revealed that participants expected to become better familiar with physical signals and gain more understanding of their migraine attacks and noted that the app should be simple and understandable. Postusability analysis indicated that participants had an overall positive user experience with some suggestions for improvement regarding the design of the wearables and app content. The intervention was safe and tolerable. One case of prespecified adverse events was recorded in which a patient developed a skin rash from the sticky surface electromyography electrodes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The app underwent a rigorous development process that indicated an overall positive user experience, good usability, and high adherence rate. This study highlights the value of usability testing in the development of mHealth apps.",3
317,User-based evaluation of applicability and usability of a wearable accelerometer device for detecting bilateral tonic-clonic seizures: A field study,"Clinical validation studies of seizure detection devices conducted in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) can be biased by the artificial environment. We report a field (phase 4) study of a wearable accelerometer device (Epi-Care) that has previously been validated in EMUs for detecting bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (BTCS). Seventy-one patients using the device (or their caregivers) completed the modified Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire. Median time patients had been using the device was 15 months (range = 24 days-6 years). In 10% of cases, patients stopped using the device due to reasons related to the device. The median sensitivity (90%) and false alarm rate (0.1/d) were similar to what had been determined in EMUs. Patients and caregivers were overall satisfied with the device (median = 5.5 on the 7-point Likert scale), considered the technical aspects satisfactory, and considered the device comfortable and efficient. Adverse effects occurred in 11%, but were only mild: skin irritation at the wrist and interference with home electronic appliances. In 55% the device influenced the number of seizures logged into the seizure diary, and in 40% it contributed to fewer seizure-related injuries. This field study demonstrates the applicability and usability of the wearable accelerometer device for detecting BTCS.",9
318,Usability Experience of a Personal Sleep Monitoring Device to Self-manage Sleep Among Persons 65 Years or Older With Self-reported Sleep Disturbances,"Increasingly, persons with self-reported health symptoms are using mobile health technologies to better understand, validate, and manage their symptoms. These off-the-shelf devices primarily utilize actigraphy to estimate sleep and activity. The purpose of this study was to describe qualitatively the experience of using a personal sleep monitoring device for sleep self-management in adults 65 years or older with self-reported sleep disturbances. This study followed a hybrid qualitative design using deductive and emergent coding derived from open-ended interviews (n = 25) after a period of 4 weeks using a wearable personal sleep monitoring device. Results expanded existing theoretical models on usability with the theme of personal meaning in the interaction between health and self-monitoring technology that were associated with age and technology use, privacy, and capability. Future studies for sleep health self-management and personally tailored interventions using personal sleep monitoring devices should continue to collect qualitative information in extending the understanding of user experience across different symptom clusters, such as sleep disturbances, that manifest more commonly in older age populations. This research is important for application in the use of mobile health technologies for nursing led health self-management interventions.",6
319,Signal Quality Evaluation of Emerging EEG Devices,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) registration as a direct measure of brain activity has unique potentials. It is one of the most reliable and predicative indicators when studying human cognition, evaluating a subject's health condition, or monitoring their mental state. Unfortunately, standard signal acquisition procedures limit the usability of EEG devices and narrow their application outside the lab. Emerging sensor technology allows gel-free EEG registration and wireless signal transmission. Thus, it enables quick and easy application of EEG devices by users themselves. Although a main requirement for the interpretation of an EEG is good signal quality, there is a lack of research on this topic in relation to new devices. In our work, we compared the signal quality of six very different EEG devices. On six consecutive days, 24 subjects wore each device for 60 min and completed tasks and games on the computer. The registered signals were evaluated in the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, we examined the percentage of artifact-contaminated EEG segments and the signal-to-noise ratios. In the frequency domain, we focused on the band power variation in relation to task demands. The results indicated that the signal quality of a mobile, gel-based EEG system could not be surpassed by that of a gel-free system. However, some of the mobile dry-electrode devices offered signals that were almost comparable and were very promising. This study provided a differentiated view of the signal quality of emerging mobile and gel-free EEG recording technology and allowed an assessment of the functionality of the new devices. Hence, it provided a crucial prerequisite for their general application, while simultaneously supporting their further development.",3
320,RRMonitor: A Resource-Aware End-to-End System for Continuous Monitoring of Respiration Rate Using Earbuds,"Respiration rate is considered as a critical vital sign, and daily monitoring of respiration rate could provide helpful information about any acute condition in the human body. While researchers have been exploring mobile devices for respiration rate monitoring, passive and continuous monitoring is still not feasible due to many usability challenges (e.g., active participation) in existing approaches. This paper presents an end-to-end system called RRMonitor that leverages the movement sensors from commodity earbuds to continuously monitor the respiration rate in near real-time. While developing the systems, we extensively explored some key parameters, algorithms, and approaches from existing literature that are better suited for continuous and passive respiration rate monitoring. RRMonitor can passively track the respiration rate with a mean absolute error as low as 1.64 cycles per minute without requiring active participation from the user.",0
321,The mobile sleep lab app: An open-source framework for mobile sleep assessment based on consumer-grade wearable devices,"Background:
        
      
      Sleep disorders have a prevalence of up to 50% and are commonly diagnosed using polysomnography. However, polysomnography requires trained staff and specific equipment in a laboratory setting, which are expensive and limited resources are available. Mobile and wearable devices such as fitness wristbands can perform limited sleep monitoring but are not evaluated well. Here, the development and evaluation of a mobile application to record and synchronize data from consumer-grade sensors suitable for sleep monitoring is presented and evaluated for data collection capability in a clinical trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Wearable and ambient consumer-grade sensors were selected to mimic the functionalities of clinical sleep laboratories. Then, a modular application was developed for recording, processing and visualizing the sensor data. A validation was performed in three phases: (1) sensor functionalities were evaluated, (2) self-experiments were performed in full-night experiments, and (3) the application was tested for usability in a clinical trial on primary snoring.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The evaluation of the sensors indicated their suitability for assessing basic sleep characteristics. Additionally, the application successfully recorded full-night sleep. The collected data was of sufficient quality to detect and measure body movements, cardiac activity, snoring and brightness. The ongoing clinical trial phase showed the successful deployment of the application by medical professionals.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The proposed software demonstrated a strong potential for medical usage. With low costs, it can be proposed for screening, long-term monitoring or in resource-austere environments. However, further validations are needed, in particular the comparison to a clinical sleep laboratory.",6
322,European Portuguese Version of the User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire (USEQ): Transcultural Adaptation and Validation Study,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers have the potential to encourage users to adopt healthier lifestyles by tracking daily health information. However, usability is a critical factor in technology adoption. Older adults may be more resistant to accepting novel technologies. Understanding the difficulties that older adults face when using activity trackers may be useful for implementing strategies to promote their use.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to conduct a transcultural adaptation of the User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire (USEQ) into European Portuguese and validate the adapted questionnaire. Additionally, we aimed to provide information about older adults' satisfaction regarding the use of an activity tracker (Xiaomi Mi Band 2).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The USEQ was translated following internationally accepted guidelines. The psychometric evaluation of the final version of the translated USEQ was assessed based on structural validity using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Construct validity was examined using divergent and discriminant validity analysis, and internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach α and McDonald ω coefficients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 110 older adults completed the questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the conceptual unidimensionality of the USEQ (χ24=7.313, P=.12, comparative fit index=0.973, Tucker-Lewis index=0.931, goodness of fit index=0.977, root mean square error of approximation=0.087, standardized root mean square residual=0.038). The internal consistency showed acceptable reliability (Cronbach α=.677, McDonald ω=0.722). Overall, 90% of the participants reported excellent satisfaction with the Xiaomi Mi Band 2.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings support the use of this translated USEQ as a valid and reliable tool for measuring user satisfaction with wearable activity trackers in older adults, with psychometric properties consistent with the original version.",1
323,Evaluating the Impact of Physical Activity Apps and Wearables: Interdisciplinary Review,"Background:
        
      
      Although many smartphone apps and wearables have been designed to improve physical activity, their rapidly evolving nature and complexity present challenges for evaluating their impact. Traditional methodologies, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), can be slow. To keep pace with rapid technological development, evaluations of mobile health technologies must be efficient. Rapid alternative research designs have been proposed, and efficient in-app data collection methods, including in-device sensors and device-generated logs, are available. Along with effectiveness, it is important to measure engagement (ie, users' interaction and usage behavior) and acceptability (ie, users' subjective perceptions and experiences) to help explain how and why apps and wearables work.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study aimed to (1) explore the extent to which evaluations of physical activity apps and wearables: employ rapid research designs; assess engagement, acceptability, as well as effectiveness; use efficient data collection methods; and (2) describe which dimensions of engagement and acceptability are assessed.
    


          Method:
        
      
      An interdisciplinary scoping review using 8 databases from health and computing sciences. Included studies measured physical activity, and evaluated physical activity apps or wearables that provided sensor-based feedback. Results were analyzed using descriptive numerical summaries, chi-square testing, and qualitative thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1829 abstracts were screened, and 858 articles read in full. Of 111 included studies, 61 (55.0%) were published between 2015 and 2017. Most (55.0%, 61/111) were RCTs, and only 2 studies (1.8%) used rapid research designs: 1 single-case design and 1 multiphase optimization strategy. Other research designs included 23 (22.5%) repeated measures designs, 11 (9.9%) nonrandomized group designs, 10 (9.0%) case studies, and 4 (3.6%) observational studies. Less than one-third of the studies (32.0%, 35/111) investigated effectiveness, engagement, and acceptability together. To measure physical activity, most studies (90.1%, 101/111) employed sensors (either in-device [67.6%, 75/111] or external [23.4%, 26/111]). RCTs were more likely to employ external sensors (accelerometers: P=.005). Studies that assessed engagement (52.3%, 58/111) mostly used device-generated logs (91%, 53/58) to measure the frequency, depth, and length of engagement. Studies that assessed acceptability (57.7%, 64/111) most often used questionnaires (64%, 42/64) and/or qualitative methods (53%, 34/64) to explore appreciation, perceived effectiveness and usefulness, satisfaction, intention to continue use, and social acceptability. Some studies (14.4%, 16/111) assessed dimensions more closely related to usability (ie, burden of sensor wear and use, interface complexity, and perceived technical performance).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The rapid increase of research into the impact of physical activity apps and wearables means that evaluation guidelines are urgently needed to promote efficiency through the use of rapid research designs, in-device sensors and user-logs to assess effectiveness, engagement, and acceptability. Screening articles was time-consuming because reporting across health and computing sciences lacked standardization. Reporting guidelines are therefore needed to facilitate the synthesis of evidence across disciplines.",3
324,Perspectives of End Users on the Potential Use of Trunk Exoskeletons for People With Low-Back Pain: A Focus Group Study,"Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to identify criteria to be considered when developing an exoskeleton for low-back pain patients by exploring the perceptions and expectations of potential end users.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Psychosocial, psychological, physical load, and personality influence incidence of low-back pain. Body-worn assistive devices that passively support the user's trunk, that is exoskeletons, can decrease mechanical loading and potentially reduce low-back pain. A user-centered approach improves patient safety and health outcomes, increases user satisfaction, and ensures usability. Still, previous studies have not taken psychological factors and the early involvement of end users into account.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We conducted focus group studies with low-back pain patients (n = 4) and health care professionals (n = 8). Focus group sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, using the general inductive approach. The focus group discussions included trying out an available exoskeleton. Questions were designed to elicit opinions about exoskeletons, desired design specifications, and usability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Important design characteristics were comfort, individual adjustability, independency in taking it on and off, and gradual adjustment of support. Patients raised concerns over loss of muscle strength. Health care professionals mentioned the risk of confirming disability of the user and increasing guarded movement in patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The focus groups showed that implementation of a trunk exoskeleton to reduce low-back pain requires an adequate implementation strategy, including supervision and behavioral coaching.
    


          Application:
        
      
      For health care professionals, the optimal field of application, prevention or rehabilitation, is still under debate. Patients see potential in an exoskeleton to overcome their limitations and expect it to improve their quality of life.",2
325,Feature stability and setup minimization for EEG-EMG-enabled monitoring systems,"Delivering health care at home emerged as a key advancement to reduce healthcare costs and infection risks, as during the SARS-Cov2 pandemic. In particular, in motor training applications, wearable and portable devices can be employed for movement recognition and monitoring of the associated brain signals. This is one of the contexts where it is essential to minimize the monitoring setup and the amount of data to collect, process, and share. In this paper, we address this challenge for a monitoring system that includes high-dimensional EEG and EMG data for the classification of a specific type of hand movement. We fuse EEG and EMG into the magnitude squared coherence (MSC) signal, from which we extracted features using different algorithms (one from the authors) to solve binary classification problems. Finally, we propose a mapping-and-aggregation strategy to increase the interpretability of the machine learning results. The proposed approach provides very low mis-classification errors ( < 0.1  ), with very few and stable MSC features ( < 10 %  of the initial set of available features). Furthermore, we identified a common pattern across algorithms and classification problems, i.e., the activation of the centro-parietal brain areas and arm's muscles in 8-80 Hz frequency band, in line with previous literature. Thus, this study represents a step forward to the minimization of a reliable EEG-EMG setup to enable gesture recognition.",3
326,"Performance, Reliability, Usability, and Safety of the ID-Cap System for Ingestion Event Monitoring in Healthy Volunteers: A Pilot Study","Background: Nonadherence to prescribed medications is an important consideration in the clinical management of patients and in clinical research and drug development. The ID-Cap System is a novel technology that provides an objective measure of medication ingestion and enables real-time reporting of verified medication adherence data at the dose level. The ID-Cap System consists of an ingestible microsensor that is embedded in an oral dosage form and, once activated by stomach fluid, communicates digital messages to an external wearable reader to confirm ingestion. Objective: The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the performance, reliability, usability, and safety of the ID-Cap System for remote monitoring of 20 ingestion events over four weeks in 20 healthy volunteers. Design: This study was an open-label, single-arm, exploratory study of the ID-Cap System. The study design included the following three phases: 1) screening phase, 2) treatment phase consisting of 20 daily capsule ingestion events over a four-week period, and 3) follow-up phase consisting of a follow-up study visit that included an abdominal X-ray and a follow-up phone call. The initial use of the ID-Cap Reader and ingestion of the first study capsule were directly observed by the investigator during the first study visit. Subsequent study capsule ingestions were completed outside the research facility at the study participant's home or other location of his or her choice with ingestion assessed using the ID-Cap System. Setting: The study was conducted at a single clinical research site in Gainesville, Florida. Participants: Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled in this four-week pilot study that was conducted between September and November 2014. Measurements: Study measurements included ID-Tag detection indicating capsule ingestion, utilization of the ID-Cap System consistent with instructions for use, adverse event reports, discontinuations of the System during the study, and safety assessments related to excretion of the ID-Tags through abdominal X-ray evaluations. Results: Positive detection accuracy was 100 percent for the 20 directly observed ingestions of study capsules that occurred during the initial study visits. Of the 384 ingestion events that were self-administered by the study participants without direct observation, 371 were accurately detected using the ID-Cap System. Overall adherence to the prescribed study capsules as measured by the ID-Cap System was 97.75 percent (391 detections/400 expected ingestion events). Significant intra-individual and inter-individual variability in the timing of self-administered doses was observed in this study. No adverse events were reported, and no study participants discontinued use of the ID-Cap System for any reason during the study. There was no evidence indicating retention of ID-Tags based on abdominal X-ray evaluations. Conclusion: The ID-Cap System enables accurate measurement of medication adherence for oral drug therapy at the dose level. This study supports the clinical validation of the technology and feasibility in using the system for the collection and real-time reporting of medication adherence in the clinical management of patients and in clinical research and drug development.",7
327,"Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE): A Digital Tool to Support Recovery from Substance Use Disorder","Background:
        
      
      Substance use disorders are a highly prevalent group of chronic diseases with devastating individual and public health consequences. Current treatment strategies suffer from high rates of relapse, or return to drug use, and novel solutions are desperately needed. Realize Analyze Engage (RAE) is a digital, mHealth intervention that focusses on real time, objective detection of high-risk events (stress and drug craving) to deploy just-in-time supportive interventions. The present study aims to (1) evaluate the accuracy and usability of the RAE system and (2) evaluate the impact of RAE on patient centered outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The first phase of the study will be an observational trial of N = 50 participants in outpatient treatment for SUD using the RAE system for 30 days. Accuracy of craving and stress detection algorithms will be evaluated, and usability of RAE will be explored via semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with SUD treatment clinicians. The second phase of the study will be a randomized controlled trial of RAE vs usual care to evaluate rates of return to use, retention in treatment, and quality of life.
    


          Anticipated findings and future directions:
        
      
      The RAE platform is a potentially powerful tool to de-escalate stress and craving outside of the clinical milieu, and to connect with a support system needed most. RAE also aims to provide clinicians with actionable insight to understand patients' level of risk, and contextual clues for their triggers in order to provide more personalized recovery support.",4
328,Relationship Between Muscular Activity and Assistance Magnitude for a Myoelectric Model Based Controlled Exosuit,"The growing field of soft wearable exosuits, is gradually gaining terrain and proposing new complementary solutions in assistive technology, with several advantages in terms of portability, kinematic transparency, ergonomics, and metabolic efficiency. Those are palatable benefits that can be exploited in several applications, ranging from strength and resistance augmentation in industrial scenarios, to assistance or rehabilitation for people with motor impairments. To be effective, however, an exosuit needs to synergistically work with the human and matching specific requirements in terms of both movements kinematics and dynamics: an accurate and timely intention-detection strategy is the paramount aspect which assume a fundamental importance for acceptance and usability of such technology. We previously proposed to tackle this challenge by means of a model-based myoelectric controller, treating the exosuit as an external muscular layer in parallel to the human biomechanics and as such, controlled by the same efferent motor commands of biological muscles. However, previous studies that used classical control methods, demonstrated that the level of device's intervention and effectiveness of task completion are not linearly related: therefore, using a newly implemented EMG-driven controller, we isolated and characterized the relationship between assistance magnitude and muscular benefits, with the goal to find a range of assistance which could make the controller versatile for both dynamic and static tasks. Ten healthy participants performed the experiment resembling functional daily activities living in separate assistance conditions: without the device's active support and with different levels of intervention by the exosuit. Higher assistance levels resulted in larger reductions in the activity of the muscles augmented by the suit actuation and a good performance in motion accuracy, despite involving a decrease of the movement velocities, with respect to the no assistance condition. Moreover, increasing torque magnitude by the exosuit resulted in a significant reduction in the biological torque at the elbow joint and in a progressive effective delay in the onset of muscular fatigue. Thus, contrarily to classical force and proportional myoelectric schemes, the implementation of an opportunely tailored EMG-driven model based controller affords to naturally match user's intention detection and provide an assistance level working symbiotically with the human biomechanics.",0
329,The Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II to Assess the Use of the Apple Watch in Older Emergency Department Patients With Falls: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,"Background:
        
      
      Falls are a common problem among older adults that lead to injury, emergency department (ED) visits, and institutionalization. The Apple Watch can detect falls and alert caregivers and clinicians that help is needed; the device could also be used to objectively collect data on gait, fitness, and falls as part of clinical trials. However, little is known about the ease of use of this technology among older adult ED patients, a population at high risk of recurrent falls.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The goal of this study-the Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II-is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch Series 4 paired with the iPhone and our research app Rhode Island FitTest (RIFitTest) among older adult ED patients seeking care for falls.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We will conduct field-testing with older adult ED patients (n=25) who sustained a fall and their caregivers (n=5) to determine whether they can use the Apple Watch, iPhone, and app either (1) continuously or (2) periodically, with or without telephone assistance from the research staff, to assess gait, fitness, and/or falls over time. During the initial encounter, participants will receive training in the Apple Watch, iPhone, and our research app. They will receive an illustrated training manual and a number to call if they have questions about the research protocol or device usage. Participants will complete surveys and cognitive and motor assessments on the app during the study period. At the conclusion of the study, we will solicit participant feedback through semistructured interviews. Qualitative data will be summarized using framework matrix analyses. Sensor and survey response data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Recruitment began in December 2019 and was on pause from April 2020 until September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Study recruitment will continue until 30 participants are enrolled. This study has been approved by the Rhode Island Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval 1400781-16).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      GAPcare II will provide insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch, iPhone, and the RIFitTest app in the population most likely to benefit from the technology: older adults at high risk of recurrent falls. In the future, wearables could be used as part of fall prevention interventions to prevent injury before it occurs.

330,Helping Hands: Using Augmented Reality to Provide Remote Guidance to Health Professionals,"Access to expert practitioners or geographic distance can compound the capacity for appropriate supervision of health professionals in the workplace. Guidance and support of clinicians and students to undertake new or infrequent procedures can be resource intensive. The Helping Hands remote augmented reality system is an innovation to support the development of, and oversee the acquisition of procedural skills through remote learning and teaching supervision while in clinical practice. Helping Hands is a wearable, portable, hands-free, low cost system comprised of two networked laptops, a head-mounted display worn by the recipient and a display screen used remotely by the instructor. Hand hygiene was used as the test procedure as it is a foundation skill learned by all health profession students. The technology supports unmediated remote gesture guidance by augmenting the object with the Helping Hands of a health professional. A laboratory-based study and field trial tested usability and feasibility of the remote guidance system. The study found the Helping Hands system did not compromise learning outcomes. This innovation has the potential to transform remote learning and teaching supervision by enabling health professionals and students opportunities to develop and improve their procedural performance at the workplace.",2
331,Intrinsic somatosensory feedback supports motor control and learning to operate artificial body parts,"Objective.Considerable resources are being invested to enhance the control and usability of artificial limbs through the delivery of unnatural forms of somatosensory feedback. Here, we investigated whether intrinsic somatosensory information from the body part(s) remotely controlling an artificial limb can be leveraged by the motor system to support control and skill learning.Approach.We used local anaesthetic to attenuate somatosensory inputs to the big toes while participants learned to operate through pressure sensors a toe-controlled and hand-worn robotic extra finger. Motor learning outcomes were compared against a control group who received sham anaesthetic and quantified in three different task scenarios: while operating in isolation from, in synchronous coordination, and collaboration with, the biological fingers.Main results.Both groups were able to learn to operate the robotic extra finger, presumably due to abundance of visual feedback and other relevant sensory cues. Importantly, the availability of displaced somatosensory cues from the distal bodily controllers facilitated the acquisition of isolated robotic finger movements, the retention and transfer of synchronous hand-robot coordination skills, and performance under cognitive load. Motor performance was not impaired by toes anaesthesia when tasks involved close collaboration with the biological fingers, indicating that the motor system can close the sensory feedback gap by dynamically integrating task-intrinsic somatosensory signals from multiple, and even distal, body-parts.Significance.Together, our findings demonstrate that there are multiple natural avenues to provide intrinsic surrogate somatosensory information to support motor control of an artificial body part, beyond artificial stimulation.",0
332,Feasibility of Real-time Behavior Monitoring Via Mobile Technology in Czech Adults Aged 50 Years and Above: 12-Week Study With Ecological Momentary Assessment,"Background:
        
      
      Czech older adults have lower rates of physical activity than the average population and lag behind in the use of digital technologies, compared with their peers from other European countries.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to assess the feasibility of intensive behavior monitoring through technology in Czech adults aged ≥50 years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants (N=30; mean age 61.2 years, SD 6.8 years, range 50-74 years; 16/30, 53% male; 7/30, 23% retired) were monitored for 12 weeks while wearing a Fitbit Charge 2 monitor and completed three 8-day bursts of intensive data collection through surveys presented on a custom-made mobile app. Web-based surveys were also completed before and at the end of the 12-week period (along with poststudy focus groups) to evaluate participants' perceptions of their experience in the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All 30 participants completed the study. Across the three 8-day bursts, participants completed 1454 out of 1744 (83% compliance rate) surveys administered 3 times per day on a pseudorandom schedule, 451 out of 559 (81% compliance rate) end-of-day surveys, and 736 episodes of self-reported planned physical activity (with 29/736, 3.9% of the reports initiated but returned without data). The overall rating of using the mobile app and Fitbit was above average (74.5 out of 100 on the System Usability Scale). The majority reported that the Fitbit (27/30, 90%) and mobile app (25/30, 83%) were easy to use and rated their experience positively (25/30, 83%). Focus groups revealed that some surveys were missed owing to notifications not being noticed or that participants needed a longer time window for survey completion. Some found wearing the monitor in hot weather or at night uncomfortable, but overall, participants were highly motivated to complete the surveys and be compliant with the study procedures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of a mobile survey app coupled with a wearable device appears feasible for use among Czech older adults. Participants in this study tolerated the intensive assessment schedule well, but lower compliance may be expected in studies of more diverse groups of older adults. Some difficulties were noted with the pairing and synchronization of devices on some types of smartphones, posing challenges for large-scale studies.",6
333,Development and Feasibility of a Digital Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-Based Intervention for Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Pilot Acceptability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry that is difficult to control and has high comorbidity with mood disorders including depression. Individuals experience long wait times for diagnosis and often face accessibility barriers to treatment. There is a need for a digital solution that is accessible and acceptable to those with GAD.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper aims to describe the development of a digital intervention prototype of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for GAD that sits within an existing well-being app platform, BioBase. A pilot feasibility study evaluating acceptability and usability is conducted in a sample of adults with a diagnosis of GAD, self-referred to the study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Phase 1 applied the person-based approach (creation of guiding principles, intervention design objectives, and the key intervention features). In Phase 2 participants received the app-based therapeutic and paired wearable for 2 weeks. Self-report questionnaires were obtained at baseline and posttreatment. The primary outcome was psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II [AAQ-II]) as this is the aim of ACT. Mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale [WEMWBS]) and symptoms of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment [GAD-7]) and depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) were also assessed. Posttreatment usability was assessed via self-report measures (System Usability Scale [SUS]) in addition to interviews that further explored feasibility of the digital intervention in this sample.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The app-based therapeutic was well received. Of 13 participants, 10 (77%) completed the treatment. Results show a high usability rating (83.5). Participants found the digital intervention to be relevant, useful, and helpful in managing their anxiety. Participants had lower anxiety (d=0.69) and depression (d=0.84) scores at exit, and these differences were significantly different from baseline (P=.03 and .008 for GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively). Participants had higher psychological flexibility and well-being scores at exit, although these were not significantly different from baseline (P=.11 and .55 for AAQ-II and WEMWBS, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This ACT prototype within BioBase is an acceptable and feasible digital intervention in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study suggests that this intervention warrants a larger feasibility study in adults with GAD.",3
334,OBINTER: A Holistic Approach to Catalyse the Self-Management of Chronic Obesity,"Obesity is a preventable chronic condition that, in 2016, affected more than 1.9 billion people globally. Several factors have been identified that have a positive impact on long-term weight loss programs such as personalized recommendations, adherence strategies, weight and diet follow-up or physical activity tracking. Recently, various applications have been developed which help patients to self-manage their condition. These apps implement either one or some of these identified factors; however, there is not a single application that combines all of them following a holistic approach. In this context, we developed the OBINTER platform, which assists patients during the weight loss process by targeting user engagement during the longer term. The solution includes a mobile application which allows users to fill out dietetic questionnaires, receive dietetic and nutraceutical plans, track the evolution of their weight and adherence to the diet, as well as track their physical activity via a wearable device. Furthermore, an adherence strategy has been developed as a tool to foster the app usage during the whole weight loss process. In this paper, we present how the OBINTER approach gathers all of these features as well as the positive results of a usability testing study performed to assess the performance and usability of the OBINTER platform.",0
335,BESI: Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Dementia Caregiver Empowerment-Phases 1 and 2,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Caregiver burden associated with dementia-related agitation is one of the commonest reasons a community-dwelling person with dementia (PWD) transitions to a care facility. Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Dementia Caregiver Empowerment (BESI) is a system of body-worn and in-home sensors developed to provide continuous, noninvasive agitation assessment and environmental context monitoring to detect early signs of agitation and its environmental triggers.
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      This mixed methods, remote ethnographic study is explored in a 3-phase, multiyear plan. In Phase 1, we developed and refined the BESI system and completed usability studies. Validation of the system and the development of dyad-specific models of the relationship between agitation and the environment occurred in Phase 2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Phases 1 and 2 results facilitated targeted changes in BESI, thus improving its overall usability for the final phase of the study, when real-time notifications and interventions will be implemented.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results show a valid relationship between the presence of dementia related agitation and environmental factors and that persons with dementia and their caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system like BESI.",7
336,Technology in Rehabilitation: Comparing Personalised and Global Classification Methodologies in Evaluating the Squat Exercise with Wearable IMUs,"Background:
        
      
      The barbell squat is a popularly used lower limb rehabilitation exercise. It is also an integral exercise in injury risk screening protocols. To date athlete/patient technique has been assessed using expensive laboratory equipment or subjective clinical judgement; both of which are not without shortcomings. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) may offer a low cost solution for the objective evaluation of athlete/patient technique. However, it is not yet known if global classification techniques are effective in identifying naturally occurring, minor deviations in barbell squat technique.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aims of this study were to: (a) determine if in combination or in isolation, IMUs positioned on the lumbar spine, thigh and shank are capable of distinguishing between acceptable and aberrant barbell squat technique; (b) determine the capabilities of an IMU system at identifying specific natural deviations from acceptable barbell squat technique; and (c) compare a personalised (N=1) classifier to a global classifier in identifying the above.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty-five healthy volunteers (37 males, 18 females, age = 24.21 +/- 5.25 years, height = 1.75 +/- 0.1 m, body mass = 75.09 +/- 13.56 kg) participated in the study. All participants performed a barbell squat 3-repetition maximum max strength test. IMUs were positioned on participants' lumbar spine, both shanks and both thighs; these were utilized to record tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data during all repetitions of the barbell squat exercise. Technique was assessed and labelled by a Chartered Physiotherapist using an evaluation framework. Features were extracted from the labelled IMU data. These features were used to train and evaluate both global and personalised random forests classifiers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Global classification techniques produced poor accuracy (AC), sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) scores in binary classification even with a 5 IMU set-up in both binary (AC: 64%, SE: 70%, SP: 28%) and multi-class classification (AC: 59%, SE: 24%, SP: 84%). However, utilising personalised classification techniques even with a single IMU positioned on the left thigh produced good binary classification scores (AC: 81%, SE: 81%, SP: 84%) and moderate-to-good multi-class scores (AC: 69%, SE: 70%, SP: 89%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are a number of challenges in developing global classification exercise technique evaluation systems for rehabilitation exercises such as the barbell squat. Building large, balanced data sets to train such systems is difficult and time intensive. Minor, naturally occurring deviations may not be detected utilising global classification approaches. Personalised classification approaches allow for higher accuracy and greater system efficiency for end-users in detecting naturally occurring barbell squat technique deviations. Applying this approach also allows for a single-IMU set up to achieve similar accuracy to a multi-IMU setup, which reduces total system cost and maximises system usability.",5
337,How Is Quality of mHealth Interventions for Cancer Survivors Defined and Described? An Umbrella Review,"Purpose:
        
      
      Although there are commonly accepted criteria of what defines quality of health care including cancer care, less is known about what defines quality of mHealth interventions in health care. The aim of this review was to identify how quality of mHealth interventions for cancer survivors is described and measured.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      CINAHL, EmCare, JBI, Medline, SCOPUS, and ProQuest databases from January 2008 to January 2020 were searched. Review papers with search terms related to mobile devices, quality, and cancer relevant to adults with cancer were included. Interventions needed to consist of mHealth technologies, such as mobile applications or short message service, or wearable devices. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Reviews were evaluated for coverage of quality according to six metrics defined by the Institute of Medicine: patient-centeredness, equitability, safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and efficiency. Any additional quality items were recorded. A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used to rate the quality of the reviews included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The initial search yielded 766 papers with seven systematic reviews meeting the eligibility criteria. Four papers were of AMSTAR moderate quality, with three of low quality. The median number of quality metrics reported in a review was two (the range was 1-4). Efficacy and safety and timeliness and efficiency were most reported (n = 4), followed by usability (n = 3), equitability and access (n = 2), privacy and security (n = 2), and patient-centeredness (n = 2).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is great variability in how quality of mHealth interventions is defined with no reviews addressing all quality metrics. A comprehensive approach to measure quality of mHealth interventions is needed.",4
338,"Neuromuscular Controller Embedded in a Powered Ankle Exoskeleton: Effects on Gait, Clinical Features and Subjective Perspective of Incomplete Spinal Cord Injured Subjects","Powered exoskeletons are among the emerging technologies claiming to assist functional ambulation. The potential to adapt robotic assistance based on specific motor abilities of incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) subjects, is crucial to optimize Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Achilles, an autonomous wearable robot able to assist ankle during walking, was developed for iSCI subjects and utilizes a NeuroMuscular Controller (NMC). NMC can be used to adapt robotic assistance based on specific residual functional abilities of subjects. The main aim of this pilot study was to analyze the effects of the NMC-controlled Achilles, used as an assistive device, on chronic iSCI participants' performance, by assessing gait speed during 10-session training of robot-aided walking. Secondary aims were to assess training impact on participants' motion, clinical and functional features and to evaluate subjective perspective in terms of attitude towards technology, workload, usability and satisfaction. Results showed that 5 training sessions were necessary to significantly improve robot-aided gait speed on short paths and consequently to optimize HRI. Moreover, the training allowed participants who initially were not able to walk for 6 minutes, to improve gait endurance during Achilles-aided walking and to reduce perceived fatigue. Improvements were obtained also in gait speed during free walking, thus suggesting a potential rehabilitative impact, even if Achilles-aided walking was not faster than free walking. Participants' subjective evaluations indicated a positive experience.",7
339,mHealth technologies used to capture walking and arm use behavior in adult stroke survivors: a scoping review beyond measurement properties,"Purpose:
        
      
      We aimed to provide a critical review of measurement properties of mHealth technologies used for stroke survivors to measure the amount and intensity of functional skills, and to identify facilitators and barriers toward adoption in research and clinical practice.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Using Arksey and O'Malley's framework, two independent reviewers determined eligibility and performed data extraction. We conducted an online consultation survey exercise with 37 experts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-four out of 1380 studies were included. A majority reported on lower limb behavior (n = 32), primarily step count (n = 21). Seventeen studies reported on arm-hand behaviors. Twenty-two studies reported metrics of intensity, 10 reported on energy expenditure. Reliability and validity were the most frequently reported properties, both for commercial and non-commercial devices. Facilitators and barriers included: resource costs, technical aspects, perceived usability, and ecological legitimacy. Two additional categories emerged from the survey: safety and knowledge, attitude, and clinical skill.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This provides an initial foundation for a field experiencing rapid growth, new opportunities and the promise that mHealth technologies affords for envisioning a better future for stroke survivors. We synthesized findings into a set of recommendations for clinicians and clinician-scientists about how best to choose mHealth technologies for one's individual objective.Implications for RehabilitationRehabilitation professionals are encouraged to consider the measurement properties of those technologies that are used to monitor functional locomotor and object-interaction skills in the stroke survivors they serve.Multi-modal knowledge translation strategies (research synthesis, educational courses or videos, mentorship from experts, etc.) are available to rehabilitation professionals to improve knowledge, attitude, and skills pertaining to mHealth technologies.Consider the selection of commercially available devices that are proven to be valid, reliable, accurate, and responsive to the targeted clinical population.Consider usability and privacy, confidentiality and safety when choosing a specific device or smartphone application.",4
340,Validity and Reliability of a Wearable Inertial Sensor to Measure Velocity and Power in the Back Squat and Bench Press,"Orange, ST, Metcalfe, JW, Liefeith, A, Marshall, P, Madden, LA, Fewster, CR, and Vince, RV. Validity and reliability of a wearable inertial sensor to measure velocity and power in the back squat and bench press. J Strength Cond Res 33(9): 2398-2408, 2019-This study examined the validity and reliability of a wearable inertial sensor to measure velocity and power in the free-weight back squat and bench press. Twenty-nine youth rugby league players (18 ± 1 years) completed 2 test-retest sessions for the back squat followed by 2 test-retest sessions for the bench press. Repetitions were performed at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 90% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) with mean velocity, peak velocity, mean power (MP), and peak power (PP) simultaneously measured using an inertial sensor (PUSH) and a linear position transducer (GymAware PowerTool). The PUSH demonstrated good validity (Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient [r]) and reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) only for measurements of MP (r = 0.91; ICC = 0.83) and PP (r = 0.90; ICC = 0.80) at 20% of 1RM in the back squat. However, it may be more appropriate for athletes to jump off the ground with this load to optimize power output. Further research should therefore evaluate the usability of inertial sensors in the jump squat exercise. In the bench press, good validity and reliability were evident only for the measurement of MP at 40% of 1RM (r = 0.89; ICC = 0.83). The PUSH was unable to provide a valid and reliable estimate of any other criterion variable in either exercise. Practitioners must be cognizant of the measurement error when using inertial sensor technology to quantify velocity and power during resistance training, particularly with loads other than 20% of 1RM in the back squat and 40% of 1RM in the bench press.",7
341,Low-Cost Wearable Band Sensors of Surface Electromyography for Detecting Hand Movements,"Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive measure of electrical activity generated due to muscle contraction. In recent years, sEMG signals have been increasingly used in diverse applications such as rehabilitation, pattern recognition, and control of orthotic and prosthetic systems. This study presents the development of a versatile multi-channel sEMG low-cost wearable band system to acquire 4 signals. In this case, the signals acquired with the proposed device have been used to detect hand movements. However, the WyoFlex band could be used in some sections of the arm or the leg if the section's diameter matches the diameter of the WyoFlex band. The designed WyoFlex band was fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques employing thermoplastic polyurethane and polylactic acid as manufacturing materials. Then, the proposed wearable electromyographic system (WES) consists of 2 WyoFlex bands, which simultaneously allow the wireless acquisition of 4 sEMG channels of each forearm. The collected sEMG can be visualized and stored for future post-processing stages using a graphical user interface designed in Node-RED. Several experimental tests were conducted to verify the performance of the WES. A dataset with sEMG collected from 15 healthy humans has been obtained as part of the presented results. In addition, a classification algorithm based on artificial neural networks has been implemented to validate the usability of the collected sEMG signals.",0
342,Usability Study of Mainstream Wearable Fitness Devices: Feature Analysis and System Usability Scale Evaluation,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable devices have the potential to promote a healthy lifestyle because of their real-time data monitoring capabilities. However, device usability is a critical factor that determines whether they will be adopted on a large scale. Usability studies on wearable devices are still scarce.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to compare the functions and attributes of seven mainstream wearable devices and to evaluate their usability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The wearable devices selected were the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear S, Fitbit Surge, Jawbone Up3, Mi Band, Huawei Honor B2, and Misfit Shine. A mixed method of feature comparison and a System Usability Scale (SUS) evaluation based on 388 participants was applied; the higher the SUS score, the better the usability of the product.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For features, all devices had step counting, an activity timer, and distance recording functions. The Samsung Gear S had a unique sports track recording feature and the Huawei Honor B2 had a unique wireless earphone. The Apple Watch, Samsung Gear S, Jawbone Up3, and Fitbit Surge could measure heart rate. All the devices were able to monitor sleep, except the Apple Watch. For product characteristics, including attributes such as weight, battery life, price, and 22 functions such as step counting, activity time, activity type identification, sleep monitoring, and expandable new features, we found a very weak negative correlation between the SUS scores and price (r=-.10, P=.03) and devices that support expandable new features (r=-.11, P=.02), and a very weak positive correlation between the SUS scores and devices that support the activity type identification function (r=.11, P=.02). The Huawei Honor B2 received the highest score of mean 67.6 (SD 16.1); the lowest Apple Watch score was only 61.4 (SD 14.7). No significant difference was observed among brands. The SUS score had a moderate positive correlation with the user's experience (length of time the device was used) (r=.32, P<.001); participants in the medical and health care industries gave a significantly higher score (mean 61.1, SD 17.9 vs mean 68.7, SD 14.5, P=.03).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The functions of wearable devices tend to be homogeneous and usability is similar across various brands. Overall, Mi Band had the lowest price and the lightest weight. Misfit Shine had the longest battery life and most functions, and participants in the medical and health care industries had the best evaluation of wearable devices. The perceived usability of mainstream wearable devices is unsatisfactory and customer loyalty is not high. A consumer's SUS rating for a wearable device is related to their personal situation instead of the device brand. Device manufacturers should put more effort into developing innovative functions and improving the usability of their products by integrating more cognitive behavior change techniques.",3
343,Usability of a wearable fall detection prototype from the perspective of older people-A real field testing approach,"Aims and objectives:
        
      
      Community-dwelling older people were involved in the testing of a fall detection device to improve its utilisation and acceptance in everyday life.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The usability of alerting devices remains unsatisfactory, as they are scarcely utilised by older people, despite wide recognition of the importance of rapid assistance after a fall. Moreover, the time a person remains on the floor negatively impacts the severity of fall consequences. However, it is unclear how to increase alerting device utilisation in everyday life. Therefore, older people were involved in this research to consider their perspective during prototype development.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A qualitative focus group study was conducted, following a real field testing approach, underpinned by the theoretical framework ""Medical Device Technology Development Process.""
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifteen community-dwelling older people tested the prototype in daily living over a period of nine days. Different means of involvement were exploited such as ""user seminars"" or ""discussion with users."" On day 9, data were collected using focus groups and analysed with qualitative content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The participants' perspectives yielded positive aspects of the prototype along with aspects requiring improvement. They indicated that technical requirements are essential. They also revealed that a minimal change in daily routines, support for physical activity and independent living and the inclusion of trusted contact persons could lead to wider use of the alerting device.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Involving users is crucial in gaining a deeper understanding of aspects influencing utilisation of an alerting device. The study revealed that usability is influenced both by technical requirements as well as habits and personal preferences. This finding is vital, as habits and personal preferences can only be identified through the involvement of target users.
    


          Relevance to clinical practice:
        
      
      The study provides key insights for health practitioners interested in promoting the use of an alerting device in community-dwelling older people.",2
344,The use of wearable devices for walking and running gait analysis outside of the lab: A systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      Quantitative gait analysis is essential for evaluating walking and running patterns for markers of pathology, injury, or other gait characteristics. It is expected that the portability, affordability, and applicability of wearable devices to many different populations will have contributed advancements in understanding the real-world gait patterns of walkers and runners. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to identify how wearable devices are being used for gait analysis in out-of-lab settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted in the following scientific databases: PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SportDiscus. Each of the included articles was assessed using a custom quality assessment. Information was extracted from each included article regarding the participants, protocol, sensor(s), and analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 61 articles were reviewed: 47 involved gait analysis during walking, 13 involved gait analysis during running, and one involved both walking and running. Most studies performed adequately on measures of reporting, and external and internal validity, but did not provide a sufficient description of power. Small, unobtrusive wearable devices have been used in retrospective studies, producing unique measures of gait quality. Walking, but not running, studies have begun to use wearable devices for gait analysis among large numbers of participants in their natural environment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the advantages provided by the portability and accessibility of wearable devices, more studies monitoring gait over long periods of time, among large numbers of participants, and in natural walking and running environments are needed to analyze real-world gait patterns, and would facilitate prospective, subject-specific, and subgroup investigations. The development of wearables-specific metrics for gait analysis provide insights regarding the quality of gait that cannot be determined using traditional components of in-lab gait analyses. However, guidelines for the usability of wearable devices and the validity of wearables-based measurements of gait quality need to be established.",4
345,Impact of delayed response on wearable cognitive assistance,"Wearable cognitive assistants (WCA) are anticipated to become a widely-used application class, in conjunction with emerging network infrastructures like 5G that incorporate edge computing capabilities. While prototypical studies of such applications exist today, the relationship between infrastructure service provisioning and its implication for WCA usability is largely unexplored despite the relevance that these applications have for future networks. This paper presents an experimental study assessing how WCA users react to varying end-to-end delays induced by the application pipeline or infrastructure. Participants interacted directly with an instrumented task-guidance WCA as delays were introduced into the system in a controllable fashion. System and task state were tracked in real time, and biometric data from wearable sensors on the participants were recorded. Our results show that periods of extended system delay cause users to correspondingly (and substantially) slow down in their guided task execution, an effect that persists for a time after the system returns to a more responsive state. Furthermore, the slow-down in task execution is correlated with a personality trait, neuroticism, associated with intolerance for time delays. We show that our results implicate impaired cognitive planning, as contrasted with resource depletion or emotional arousal, as the reason for slowed user task executions under system delay. The findings have several implications for the design and operation of WCA applications as well as computational and communication infrastructure, and additionally for the development of performance analysis tools for WCA.",2
346,Validity of New Technologies That Measure Bone-Related Dietary and Physical Activity Risk Factors in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Scoping Review,"New technologies may improve the validity of dietary and physical activity assessment and thereby associated findings for lifestyle-related bone health research. This scoping review mapped the evidence for the validity of new technologies that measure bone-related dietary and physical activity risk factors in adolescents and young adults. A systematic literature search was conducted using seven electronic databases for peer-reviewed studies published from January 2008 to 2021. Four studies from four countries were deemed eligible and included in the qualitative synthesis for this review. Two studies assessed diet, reporting the validity or usability of apps. Apps were shown to be a valid tool to measure the dietary intake of vitamin D (r = 0.84) and calcium (r = 0.63). Two studies assessed physical activity and reported the validity of wearable devices to measure impact loading. Hip-worn raw acceleration output correlated positively with ground reaction forces (GRF) for both studies (r range = 0.50-0.87), but wrist-worn accelerations and loading outcomes differed between studies, reporting poor to strong correlations (r range = 0.17-0.87). More research to provide robust evidence concerning validity, reliability, usability and engagement for the use of newer technologies is needed for future diet and physical activity bone research.",1
347,Development of an Ambulatory Biofeedback App to Enhance Emotional Awareness in Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder: Multicycle Usability Testing Study,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with borderline personality disorder experience great difficulties in regulating their emotions. They often are unable to effectively detect their emotional arousal and struggle to timely apply learned techniques for emotion regulation. Although the use of continuous wearable biofeedback has been repeatedly suggested as an option to improve patients' emotional awareness, this type of app is not yet available for clinical use. Therefore, we developed an ambulatory biofeedback app named Sense-IT that can be integrated in mental health care.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to develop an ambulatory biofeedback app for mental health care that helps with learning to better recognize changes in personal emotional arousal and increases emotional awareness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using several methods in a tailored User Centred Design (UCD) framework, we tested the app's usability and user experience (UX) via a cyclic developmental process with multiple user groups (patients, therapists, and UCD experts; 3-5 per group, per cycle).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The process resulted in a stable prototype of the app that meets most of the identified user requirements. The app was valued as useful and usable by involved patients, therapists, and UCD experts. On the Subjective Usability Scale (SUS), the patients rated the app as ""Good"" (average score of 78.8), whereas the therapists rated the app as ""OK"" (average score of 59.4). The UCD experts judged the app's overall usability as between ""OK"" and ""acceptable"" (average score of 0.87 on a cognitive walkthrough). As most critical usability problems were identified and addressed in the first cycle of the prototyping process, subsequent cycles were mainly about implementing new or extending existing functions, and other adjustments to improve UX.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      mHealth development within a clinical mental health setting is challenging, yet feasible and welcomed by targeted users. This paper shows how new mHealth interventions for mental health care can be met with enthusiasm and openness by user groups that are known to be reluctant to embrace technological innovations. The use of the UCD framework, involving multiple user groups, proved to be of added value during design and realization as evidenced by the complementary requirements and perspectives. Future directions on studying clinical effectiveness of the app, appliance of the app in other fields, and the implications of integration of the app for daily practice in mental health are discussed.",2
348,Optimization of a Digital Medicine System in Psychiatry,"Background:
        
      
      Nonadherence to medication compromises the effectiveness of psychiatric treatments in patients with serious mental illness (SMI). A newly developed digital medicine system (DMS) offers an opportunity to objectively assess and report patient medication adherence. DMS includes a wearable sensor that receives a data signal from a medication tablet with an embedded ingestible sensor after ingestion of the medication and transmits that data to the patient's mobile device to display health care information for the patient and treatment team.
    


          Methods/results:
        
      
      Development of a DMS requires a program that investigates safety, tolerability, and usability of the system in patients with SMI. It necessitates rapid design adaptation of the individual components and the integrated system and human factors studies with the intended users. This article describes the program's methodology and shows results from 3 early studies, conducted in 2013 and 2014, to illustrate diversity of the programs' methodology. First, a standard 28-day study showed minimal skin irritation and demonstrated acceptable wearability of the wearable sensor. Second, a 16-week study provided usability feedback from patients with SMI and caregivers to improve the mobile application. Third, end-to-end bench-level integrated system testing led to multiple substudies of a master protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02091882) to investigate various aspects of the system (eg, ingestible sensor detection and latency).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To develop a DMS in psychiatry, the system's multiple components must be considered simultaneously using various methodologies. A focus on usability, along with agile evaluation and feedback across studies, provides an optimal strategy for ensuring patient acceptance and successful regulatory review.",0
349,JNER at 15 years: analysis of the state of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"On JNER's 15th anniversary, this editorial analyzes the state of the field of neuroengineering and rehabilitation. I first discuss some ways that the nature of neurorehabilitation research has evolved in the past 15 years based on my perspective as editor-in-chief of JNER and a researcher in the field. I highlight increasing reliance on advanced technologies, improved rigor and openness of research, and three, related, new paradigms - wearable devices, the Cybathlon competition, and human augmentation studies - indicators that neurorehabilitation is squarely in the age of wearability. Then, I briefly speculate on how the field might make progress going forward, highlighting the need for new models of training and learning driven by big data, better personalization and targeting, and an increase in the quantity and quality of usability and uptake studies to improve translation.",4
350,Security Requirements for the Internet of Things: A Systematic Approach,"There has been a tremendous growth in the number of smart devices and their applications (e.g., smart sensors, wearable devices, smart phones, smart cars, etc.) in use in our everyday lives. This is accompanied by a new form of interconnection between the physical and digital worlds, commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT). This is a paradigm shift, where anything and everything can be interconnected via a communication medium. In such systems, security is a prime concern and protecting the resources (e.g., applications and services) from unauthorized access needs appropriately designed security and privacy solutions. Building secure systems for the IoT can only be achieved through a thorough understanding of the particular needs of such systems. The state of the art is lacking a systematic analysis of the security requirements for the IoT. Motivated by this, in this paper, we present a systematic approach to understand the security requirements for the IoT, which will help designing secure IoT systems for the future. In developing these requirements, we provide different scenarios and outline potential threats and attacks within the IoT. Based on the characteristics of the IoT, we group the possible threats and attacks into five areas, namely communications, device/services, users, mobility and integration of resources. We then examine the existing security requirements for IoT presented in the literature and detail our approach for security requirements for the IoT. We argue that by adhering to the proposed requirements, an IoT system can be designed securely by achieving much of the promised benefits of scalability, usability, connectivity, and flexibility in a practical and comprehensive manner.",2
351,Visualization of Dust Generation in Outdoor Workplaces Using A Wearable Particle Monitor and Global Navigation Satellite System,"We manufactured a wearable particle monitor (WPM), which is a simple and low-cost dust monitor. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the device by using it and location information of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to measure dust generation in outdoor workplaces. We used nine WPMs and a particle counter KC-52 to measure in parallel the dust concentration diffusing standard particles in a dust exposure apparatus to evaluate the measurability of the WPM, and visualized dust generation in outdoor workplaces to evaluate its usability. We obtained location information using a GNSS in parallel with measuring with the WPM. The measured values of the WPM followed the measured values of the KC-52, with a strong correlation of the values between the KC-52 and each WPM. The discrepancy among devices tended to increase, however, because the measured values of the WPMs increased. For outdoor measurements, we could create a heat map of the relative values of dust generation by combining two data of the WPM and the GNSS. The methods of using the WPM could overview the conditions needed to produce dust emissions in dust-generating workplaces.",1
352,Feasibility of overnight electrical stimulation-induced muscle activation in people with a spinal cord injury. A Pilot study,"Study design:
        
      
      We investigated whether overnight ES is a feasible method to activate gluteal, quadriceps, and hamstrings muscles in a two-week experiment. Electrical stimulation (ES) induced muscle contractions have proven positive effects on risk factors for developing pressure ulcers in people with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore prolonged overnight ES-induced muscle activation is interesting, but has never been studied.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To study feasibility of ES-induced leg muscle activation. In eight participants with motor complete SCI gluteal, hamstrings and quadriceps muscles were activated with a 2-weeks overnight stimulation protocol, 8 h per night, using specially developed ES-shorts.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The Netherlands.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Muscle fatigue was determined with a muscle contraction sensor. Questionnaires on sleep quality (SQ) and the ES-shorts usability were taken.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After 8 h of activation muscles still contracted, although fatigue occurred, and mean contraction size was lower at the end of a cycle (p = 0.03). SQ (0-100) after intervention was 75, and 66 after 4 weeks without overnight ES (p = 0.04) indicating ES improves sleep quality. The usability of the ES-shorts was good.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study shows that overnight ES-induced muscle activation using ES-shorts in SCI is a new, feasible method that does not interfere with sleep. The nightly use of the ES-shorts might be considered as an important part of the daily routine in SCI.",0
353,Smart Patch for Skin Temperature: Preliminary Study to Evaluate Psychometrics and Feasibility,"There is a need for continuous, non-invasive monitoring of biological data to assess health and wellbeing. Currently, many types of smart patches have been developed to continuously monitor body temperature, but few trials have been completed to evaluate psychometrics and feasibility for human subjects in real-life scenarios. The aim of this feasibility study was to evaluate the reliability, validity and usability of a smart patch measuring body temperature in healthy adults. The smart patch consisted of a fully integrated wearable wireless sensor with a multichannel temperature sensor, signal processing integrated circuit, wireless communication feature and a flexible battery. Thirty-five healthy adults were recruited for this test, carried out by wearing the patches on their upper chests for 24 h and checking their body temperature six times a day using infrared forehead thermometers as a gold standard for testing validity. Descriptive statistics, one-sampled and independent t-tests, Pearson's correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plot were examined for body temperatures between two measures. In addition, multiple linear regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and qualitative content analysis were conducted. Among the 35 participants, 29 of them wore the patch for over 19 h (dropout rate: 17.14%). Mean body temperature measured by infrared forehead thermometers and smart patch ranged between 32.53 and 38.2 °C per person and were moderately correlated (r = 0.23-0.43) overall. Based on a Bland-Altman plot, approximately 94% of the measurements were located within one standard deviation (upper limit = 4.52, lower limit = -5.82). Most outliers were identified on the first measurement and were located below the lower limit. It is appropriate to use 37.5 °C in infrared forehead temperature as a cutoff to define febrile conditions. Users' position while checking and ambient temperature and humidity are not affected to the smart patch body temperature. Overall, the participants showed high usability and satisfaction on the survey. Few participants reported discomfort due to limited daily activity, itchy skin or detaching concerns. In conclusion, epidermal electronic sensor technologies provide a promising method for continuously monitoring individuals' body temperatures, even in real-life situations. Our study findings show the potential for smart patches to monitoring non-febrile condition in the community.",0
354,Wearables in epilepsy and Parkinson's disease-A focus group study,"Objectives:
        
      
      Wearable sensors that measure movement and physiological variables are attractive for clinical evaluation of neurological diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to explore perceptions regarding the use of wearable technology in disease monitoring and management as reported by individuals with epilepsy and Parkinson's disease as well as health professionals working with these patient groups.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Six patient groups (n=25) and two groups with health professionals (n=15) participated in this qualitative, descriptive study with focus group interviews. A manifest qualitative content analysis was used.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four categories and nine subcategories emerged from the analysis. Participants saw possible benefits for improved treatment effect and valued this benefit more than possible inconvenience of wearing the sensors. Discrete design and simplicity were considered as facilitators for improved usability. They emphasized the importance of interactive information between patients and health professionals. However, they were concerned about unclear information and inconclusive recordings and some fears about personal integrity were at odds with the expectations on interactivity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients need to feel well informed and find an added value in using wearables. Wearables need to be user-friendly, have an attractive design, and show clinical efficacy in improving disease management. Variations in perceptions regarding integrity, benefits, and effectiveness of monitoring indicate possible conflicts of expectations among participants. The engagement of end users, patients, and health professionals, in the design and implementation process, is crucial for the development of wearable devices that enhance and facilitate neurological rehabilitation practice.",2
355,A RGBD-Based Interactive System for Gaming-Driven Rehabilitation of Upper Limbs,"Current physiotherapy services may not be effective or suitable for certain patients due to lack of motivation, poor adherence to exercises, insufficient supervision and feedback or, in the worst case, refusal to continue with the rehabilitation plan. This paper introduces a novel approach for rehabilitation of upper limbs through KineActiv, a platform based on Microsoft Kinect v2 and developed in Unity Engine. KineActiv proposes exergames to encourage patients to perform rehabilitation exercises prescribed by a specialist, controls the patient's performance, and corrects execution errors on the fly. KineActiv comprises a web platform where the physiotherapist can review session results, monitor patient health, and adjust rehabilitation routines. We recruited 10 patients for assessing the system usability as well as the system performance. Results show that KineActiv is a usable, enjoyable and reliable system, that does not cause any negative feelings.",0
356,"Comprehensive pregnancy monitoring with a network of wireless, soft, and flexible sensors in high- and low-resource health settings","Vital signs monitoring is a fundamental component of ensuring the health and safety of women and newborns during pregnancy, labor, and childbirth. This monitoring is often the first step in early detection of pregnancy abnormalities, providing an opportunity for prompt, effective intervention to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Contemporary pregnancy monitoring systems require numerous devices wired to large base units; at least five separate devices with distinct user interfaces are commonly used to detect uterine contractility, maternal blood oxygenation, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate. Current monitoring technologies are expensive and complex with implementation challenges in low-resource settings where maternal morbidity and mortality is the greatest. We present an integrated monitoring platform leveraging advanced flexible electronics, wireless connectivity, and compatibility with a wide range of low-cost mobile devices. Three flexible, soft, and low-profile sensors offer comprehensive vital signs monitoring for both women and fetuses with time-synchronized operation, including advanced parameters such as continuous cuffless blood pressure, electrohysterography-derived uterine monitoring, and automated body position classification. Successful field trials of pregnant women between 25 and 41 wk of gestation in both high-resource settings (n = 91) and low-resource settings (n = 485) demonstrate the system's performance, usability, and safety.",2
357,Remote Monitoring Telemedicine (REMOTE) Platform for Patients With Anxiety Symptoms and Alcohol Use Disorder: Protocol for a Case-Control Study,"Background:
        
      
      Monitoring mental health outcomes has traditionally been based on heuristic decisions, often based on scarce, subjective evidence, making the clinical decisions made by professionals, as well as the monitoring of these diseases, subject to flaws. However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups-experimental and control-of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data.

358,Patient and clinician use characteristics and perceptions of pulse oximeter use: A scoping review,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      The need to monitor patients outside of a formal clinical setting, such as a hospital or ambulatory care facility, has become increasingly important since COVID-19. It introduces significant challenges to ensure accurate and timely measurements, maintain strong patient engagement, and operationalise data for clinical decision-making. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) devices like the pulse oximeter help mitigate these difficulties, however, practical approaches to successfully integrate this technology into existing patient-clinician interactions that ensure the delivery of safe and effective care are vital. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesise existing literature to provide an overview of the variety of user perceptions associated with pulse oximeter devices, which may impact patients' and clinicians' acceptance of the devices in a RPM context.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A search over three databases was conducted between April 2021 - June 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A total of 16 articles were included in this scoping review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results indicate there has been an increase in use of pulse oximeters across hospital and community settings for continuous vital signs monitoring and remote monitoring of patients over time. Research in this area is shifting towards increasing accessibility of care through the development and implementation of telehealth systems and phone oximeters. Aspects of pulse oximeter UX most frequently investigated are usability and acceptability, however, these terms are often undefined, or definitions vary across studies. Perceived effectiveness, opportunity costs, and attitude towards use remain unexplored areas of UX. Overall, patients and clinicians view the pulse oximeter positively and find it user-friendly. A high level of learnability was found for the device and additional benefits included increasing patient self-efficacy and clinician motivation to work. However, issues getting an accurate reading due to device usability are still experienced by some patients and clinicians.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This scoping review is the first to summarise user perceptions of the pulse oximeter in a healthcare context. It showed that both patients and clinicians hold positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter and important factors to consider in designing user-focused services include ease-of-use and wearability of devices; context of use including user's prior health and IT knowledge; attitude towards use and perceived effectiveness; impact on user motivation and self-efficacy; and finally, potential user costs like inconvenience or increased anxiety. With the rapid increase in research studies examining pulse oximeter use for RPM since COVID-19, a systematic review is warranted as the next step to consolidate evidence and investigate the impact of these factors on pulse oximeter acceptance and effectiveness.",4
359,An Empirical Study Comparing Unobtrusive Physiological Sensors for Stress Detection in Computer Work,"Several unobtrusive sensors have been tested in studies to capture physiological reactions to stress in workplace settings. Lab studies tend to focus on assessing sensors during a specific computer task, while in situ studies tend to offer a generalized view of sensors' efficacy for workplace stress monitoring, without discriminating different tasks. Given the variation in workplace computer activities, this study investigates the efficacy of unobtrusive sensors for stress measurement across a variety of tasks. We present a comparison of five physiological measurements obtained in a lab experiment, where participants completed six different computer tasks, while we measured their stress levels using a chest-band (ECG, respiration), a wristband (PPG and EDA), and an emerging thermal imaging method (perinasal perspiration). We found that thermal imaging can detect increased stress for most participants across all tasks, while wrist and chest sensors were less generalizable across tasks and participants. We summarize the costs and benefits of each sensor stream, and show how some computer use scenarios present usability and reliability challenges for stress monitoring with certain physiological sensors. We provide recommendations for researchers and system builders for measuring stress with physiological sensors during workplace computer use.",5
360,"Improving functional disability in patients with tremor: A clinical perspective of the efficacies, considerations, and challenges of assistive technology","Despite advances in treatments for tremor disorders, many patients are still left with functional disability affecting both basic and complex tasks needed for independent living, reflecting a significant gap in the current management of tremor disorders. Assistive devices present a possible solution to bridge the gap between symptom burden and current therapies, offering safe and effective tremor suppression. Although not yet considered as an option in most therapeutic guidelines for tremor disorders, assistive technologies (AT) offer a unique opportunity as adjunctive interventions utilising new portable technologies at lower cost, with minimal adverse effects. Here, the clinical concept of Human Activity Assistive Technology model via two groups of AT (limb weights and handheld devices; orthoses and exoskeletons) in patients with tremor is reviewed, supported by clinical evidence on reduction of tremor severity or improved functional performance. Although most devices are prototypes with limited clinical evidence, many are approved as medical devices and are commercially available. However, despite increased availability of these devices, there are still barriers to their adoption, mostly influenced by perceptions on privacy, trust, and functionality/added value. Long-term adherence to these devices is also unknown. In order to promote accessibility and usability of AT for tremor, an evaluation consensus by an interdisciplinary team (users, prescribers, and technicians) is required to identify those in need and to offer device recommendations. Future developments of AT for tremor should improve user comfort by incorporating softer, lightweight materials and explore new mechanisms to enhance wearability and long-term efficacies. This article is part of the Special Issue ""Tremor"" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.",2
361,Mixed Reality Visualization of Radiation Dose for Health Professionals and Patients in Interventional Radiology,"For interventional radiology, dose management has persisted as a crucially important issue to reduce radiation exposure to patients and medical staff. This study designed a real-time dose visualization system for interventional radiology designed with mixed reality technology and Monte Carlo simulation. An earlier report described a Monte-Carlo-based estimation system, which simulates a patient's skin dose and air dose distributions, adopted for our system. We also developed a system of acquiring fluoroscopic conditions to input them into the Monte Carlo system. Then we combined the Monte Carlo system with a wearable device for three-dimensional holographic visualization. The estimated doses were transferred sequentially to the device. The patient's dose distribution was then projected on the patient body. The visualization system also has a mechanism to detect one's position in a room to estimate the user's exposure dose to detect and display the exposure level. Qualitative tests were conducted to evaluate the workload and usability of our mixed reality system. An end-to-end system test was performed using a human phantom. The acquisition system accurately recognized conditions that were necessary for real-time dose estimation. The dose hologram represents the patient dose. The user dose was changed correctly, depending on conditions and positions. The perceived overall workload score (33.50) was lower than the scores reported in the literature for medical tasks (50.60) for computer activities (54.00). Mixed reality dose visualization is expected to improve exposure dose management for patients and health professionals by exhibiting the invisible radiation exposure in real space.",1
362,A review of methods for achieving upper limb movement following spinal cord injury through hybrid muscle stimulation and robotic assistance,"Individuals with tetraplegia, typically attributed to spinal cord injuries (SCI) at the cervical level, experience significant health care costs and loss of independence due to their limited reaching and grasping capabilities. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a promising intervention to restore arm and hand function because it activates a person's own paralyzed muscles; however, NMES sometimes lacks the accuracy and repeatability necessary to position the limb for functional tasks, and repeated muscle stimulation can lead to fatigue. Robotic devices have the potential to restore function when used as assistive devices to supplement or replace limited or lost function of the upper limb following SCI. Unfortunately, most robotic solutions are bulky or require significant power to operate, limiting their applicability to restore functional independence in a home environment. Combining NMES and robotic support systems into a single hybrid neuroprosthesis is compelling, since the robotic device can supplement the action of the muscles and improve repeatability and accuracy. Research groups have begun to explore applications of movement assistance for individuals with spinal cord injury using these technologies in concert. In this review, we present the state of the art in hybrid NMES-orthotic systems for upper limb movement restoration following spinal cord injury, and suggest areas for emphasis necessary to move the field forward. Currently, NMES-robotic systems use either surface or implanted electrodes to stimulate muscles, with rigid robotic supports holding the limb against gravity, or providing assistance in reaching movements. Usability of such systems outside of the lab or clinic is limited due to the complexity of both the mechanical components, stimulation systems, and human-machine interfaces. Assessment of system and participant performance is not reported in a standardized way. Future directions should address wearability through improvements in component technologies and user interfaces. Further, increased integration of the control action between NMES and robotic subsystems to reanimate the limb should be pursued. Standardized reporting of system performance and expanded clinical assessments of these systems are also needed. All of these advancements are critical to facilitate translation from lab to home.",0
363,Feasibility and Acceptability of Wearable Sensor Placement for Measuring Screen Time of Children,"Introduction/purpose:
        
      
      Wearables that include a color light sensor are a promising measure of electronic screen use in adults. However, to extend this approach to children, we need to understand feasibility of wear placement. The purpose of this study was to examine parent perceptions of children's acceptability of different sensor placements and feasibility of free-living 3- to 7-day wear protocols.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was conducted in three phases. In phase 1, caregivers (n=161) of 3- to 8-year-old children completed an online survey to rate aspects of fitting and likelihood of wear for seven methods (headband, eyeglasses, skin adhesive patch, shirt clip/badge, mask, necklace, and vest). In phase 2, children (n=31) were recruited to wear one of the top five prototypes for three days (n=6 per method). In phase 3, children (n=23) were recruited to wear prototypes of the top three prototypes from phase 2 (n=8 per method) for 7 days. In phases 2 and 3, parents completed wear logs and surveys about their experiences. Parents scored each wearable on three domains (ease of use, likelihood of wear, and child enjoyment). Scores were averaged to compute an everyday ""usability"" score (0, worst, to 200, best).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Phase 1 results suggested that the headband, eyeglasses, patch, clip/badge, and vest had the best potential for long-term wear. In phase 2, time spent wearing prototypes and usability scores were highest for the eyeglasses (10.4 hours/day, score=155.4), clip/badge (9.8 hours/day, score=145.8), and vest (7.1 hours/day, score=141.7). In phase 3, wearing time and usability scores were higher for the clip/badge (9.4 hours/day, score=169.6) and eyeglasses (6.5 hours/day, score=145.3) compared to the vest (4.8 hours/day, score=112.5).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Results indicate that wearable sensors clipped to a child's shirt or embedded into eyeglasses are feasible and acceptable wear methods in free-living settings. The next step is to asses the quality, validity, and reliability of data captured using these wear methods.",6
364,Patients' experience of wearing multimodal sensor devices intended to detect epileptic seizures: A qualitative analysis,"Background:
        
      
      The health management of patients with epilepsy could be improved by wearing devices that reliably detect when epileptic seizures happen. For the devices to be widely adopted, they must be acceptable and easy to use for patients, and their views are very important. Previous studies have collected feedback from patients on hypothetical devices, but very few have examined experience of wearing actual devices.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This study assessed the first-hand experiences of people with epilepsy using wearable devices, continuously over a period of time. The aim was to understand how acceptable and easy they were to use, and whether it is reasonable to expect that people will use them.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Adults with a diagnosis of epilepsy admitted routinely to a hospital epilepsy monitoring unit were asked to wear one, or more, wearable biosensor devices, tested for seizure detection. The devices are designed to continuously monitor and record signals from the body (biosignals). Participants completed semistructured interviews about their experiences of wearing the device(s). A systematic thematic analysis extracted themes from the interviews, focusing on acceptability and usability. Feedback was organized into (1) participants' experiences of the devices, any support they required and reasons for stopping wearing them; (2) their thoughts about using this technology outside a hospital setting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-one people with epilepsy wore one, or more, wearable devices for an average of 112.81 (SD = 71.83) hours. Participants found the devices convenient, and had no problem wearing them in hospital or sharing the data collected from them with the researchers and medical professionals. However, the presence of wires, bulky size, discomfort, and need for support, moderated experience. Participants' thoughts about wearing them in everyday life were strongly influenced by how visible and perceived accuracy. Willingness to use a smartphone app to complete questionnaires depended on the frequency, number of questions, and support.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, this work provides evidence about the feasibility and acceptability of using wearable devices to monitor seizure activity in people with epilepsy. Key barriers and facilitators to use while in hospital and hypothetical use in everyday life were identified and will be helpful for guiding future implementation.",6
365,Processing Photoplethysmograms Recorded by Smartwatches to Improve the Quality of Derived Pulse Rate Variability,"Cardiac monitoring based on wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) is widespread because of its usability and low cost. Unfortunately, PPG is negatively affected by various types of disruptions, which could introduce errors to the algorithm that extracts pulse rate variability (PRV). This study aims to identify the nature of such artifacts caused by various types of factors under the conditions of precisely planned experiments. We also propose methods for their reduction based solely on the PPG signal while preserving the frequency content of PRV. The accuracy of PRV derived from PPG was compared to heart rate variability (HRV) derived from the accompanying ECG. The results indicate that filtering PPG signals using the discrete wavelet transform and its inverse (DWT/IDWT) is suitable for removing slow components and high-frequency noise. Moreover, the main benefit of amplitude demodulation is better preparation of the PPG to determine the duration of pulse cycles and reduce the impact of some other artifacts. Post-processing applied to HRV and PRV indicates that the correction of outliers based on local statistical measures of signals and the autoregressive (AR) model is only important when the PPG is of low quality and has no effect under good signal quality. The main conclusion is that the DWT/IDWT, followed by amplitude demodulation, enables the proper preparation of the PPG signal for the subsequent use of PRV extraction algorithms, particularly at rest. However, post-processing in the proposed form should be applied more in the situations of observed strong artifacts than in motionless laboratory experiments.",9
366,Feasibility of a Multimodal Telemedical Intervention for Patients with Parkinson's Disease-A Pilot Study,"Symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be controlled well, but treatment often requires expert judgment. Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits to the expert's office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in patients' homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male). Mean age was 65 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean MoCA score 27. Adherence was stable throughout the study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These insights can be helpful in designing similar trials.",7
367,Medication-related cognitive artifacts used by older adults with heart failure,"Objective:
        
      
      To use a human factors perspective to examine how older adult patients with heart failure use cognitive artifacts for medication management.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a secondary analysis of data collected from 30 patients and 14 informal caregivers enrolled in a larger study of heart failure self-care. Data included photographs, observation notes, interviews, video recordings, medical record data, and surveys. These data were analyzed using an iterative content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Findings revealed that medication management was complex, inseparable from other patient activities, distributed across people, time, and place, and complicated by knowledge gaps. We identified fifteen types of cognitive artifacts including medical devices, pillboxes, medication lists, and electronic personal health records used for: 1) measurement/evaluation; 2) tracking/communication; 3) organization/administration; and 4) information/sensemaking. These artifacts were characterized by fit and misfit with the patient's sociotechnical system and demonstrated both advantages and disadvantages. We found that patients often modified or ""finished the design"" of existing artifacts and relied on ""assemblages"" of artifacts, routines, and actors to accomplish their self-care goals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Cognitive artifacts are useful but sometimes are poorly designed or are not used optimally. If appropriately designed for usability and acceptance, paper-based and computer-based information technologies can improve medication management for individuals living with chronic illness. These technologies can be designed for use by patients, caregivers, and clinicians; should support collaboration and communication between these individuals; can be coupled with home-based and wearable sensor technology; and must fit their users' needs, limitations, abilities, tasks, routines, and contexts of use.",2
368,Community-dwelling older adults' acceptance of smartwatches for health and location tracking,"Background:
        
      
      Despite rapid growth in the popularity of smartwatches, evidence lacks regarding older adults' acceptance of smartwatches. Since most wearable sensors are not designed specifically for older adults, there is a need to examine wearability and usability challenges of wearable sensing devices faced by older adults to facilitate the use of objective measurements of health and mobility.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      We aimed to examine older adults' perceptions of GPS-enabled smartwatches and to identify potential barriers and facilitators of smartwatch and sensor data use.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      As part of a larger feasibility study, we conducted a mixed-methods study that included a descriptive content analysis of interviews and a brief usability survey with 30 participants aged 60 years and older after they had used a smartwatch for 3 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most participants perceived wearable activity trackers including smartwatches and sensor-based data as useful for tracking health, finding activity patterns and promoting healthy behaviours. Privacy was of little concern, leading to willingness to share activity and location data with others. Participants identified barriers to usability as clumsy design, lack of aesthetic appeal, and difficulty reading the display and using the GPS tracking function. In contrast, identified facilitators of adoption included a big display, high-tech look, self-awareness and possible behaviour change.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Smartwatches have the potential of personalised detection of health deterioration and disability prevention, based on analysis of older adults' activities in free-living environments. The usefulness of this technology for older adults can be significantly increased by addressing usability issues and providing instructions on challenging features.
    


          Implications for practice:
        
      
      To support sustained self-monitoring behaviours through wearable sensor devices in older adults, it is critical to examine how they perceive those devices and identify factors affecting technology acceptance that can maximise adoption.",2
369,"Accuracy, satisfaction and usability of a flash glucose monitoring system among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes attending a summer camp","Background:
        
      
      The study aimed to assess accuracy, satisfaction and usability of a flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) attending a diabetes summer camp.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty-six children and adolescents with T1DM aged 6 to 17 years participating in a 7-day medically supervised summer camp were enrolled. Capillary blood glucose (BG) and flash glucose (FG) values were measured simultaneously at breakfast, lunch, and dinner and for any given FG value <72 mg/dL (<4.0 mmol/L) during daytime, <108 mg/dL (<6.0 mmol/L) at nighttime, >270 mg/dL (>15.0 mmol/L) or when patient symptoms were discordant with sensor readings. Sensor-related issues were documented and patients' and healthcare professionals' (HCPs) satisfaction was evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      FGM demonstrated satisfactory clinical accuracy compared to reference capillary BG values with 98.8% of values falling within the clinically acceptable zones (A and B) of the consensus error grid. Overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was 16.7% ± 16.1%. Specific calculations of mean absolute difference (MAD), mean relative difference (MRD), and mean difference (MD) demonstrated that FGM overestimated BG values across all glycemic ranges. Overall satisfaction with the FGM was high in 91.7% participants and 95.0% HCPs, although confidence in the system was low in 18.0% participants and 40.0% HCPs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The FGM exhibited satisfactory clinical accuracy. However, based on the present data, we conclude that no decision should be taken on the basis of a single, non-verified, FGM value alone. Our study highlights the need for revised therapeutic education for patients/families and further investigation on the integration of sensor readings in clinical decision-making.",5
370,Advances in Automation Technologies for Lower Extremity Neurorehabilitation: A Review and Future Challenges,"The world is experiencing an unprecedented, enduring, and pervasive aging process. With more people who need walking assistance, the demand for lower extremity gait rehabilitation has increased rapidly over the years. The current clinical gait rehabilitative training requires heavy involvement of both medical doctors and physical therapists, and thus, are labor intensive, subjective, and expensive. To address these problems, advanced automation techniques, especially along with the proliferation of smart sensing and actuation devices and big data analytics platforms, have been introduced into this field to make the gait rehabilitation convenient, efficient, and personalized. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review on recent technological advances in wearable sensors, biofeedback devices, and assistive robots. Empowered by the emerging networking and computing technologies in the big data era, these devices are being interconnected into smart and connected rehabilitation systems to provide nonintrusive and continuous monitoring of physical and neurological conditions of the patients, perform complex gait analysis and diagnosis, and allow real-time decision making, biofeedback, and control of assistive robots. For each technology category, a detailed comparison among the existing solutions is provided. A thorough discussion is also presented on remaining open problems and future directions to further improve the safety, efficiency, and usability of the technologies.",0
371,Enhancing Home Health Mobile Phone App Usability Through General Smartphone Training: Usability and Learnability Case Study,"Background:
        
      
      Each year, millions of older adults fall, with more than 1 out of 4 older people experiencing a fall annually, thereby causing a major social and economic impact. Falling once doubles one’s chances of falling again, making fall prediction an important aspect of preventative strategies. In this study, 22 older adults aged between 65 and 85 years were trained in the use of a smartphone-based fall prediction system. The system is designed to continuously assess fall risk by measuring various gait and balance parameters using a smart insole and smartphone, and is also designed to detect falls. The use case of the fall prediction system in question required the users to interact with the smartphone via an app for device syncing, data uploads, and checking system status.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to observe the effect that basic smartphone training could have on the user experience of a group that is not technically proficient with smartphones when using a new connected health system. It was expected that even short rudimentary training could have a large effect on user experience and therefore increase the chances of the group accepting the new technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All participants received training on how to use the system smartphone app; half of the participants (training group) also received extra training on how to use basic functions of the smartphone, such as making calls and sending text messages, whereas the other half did not receive this extra training (no extra training group). Comparison of training group and no extra training group was carried out using metrics such as satisfaction rating, time taken to complete tasks, cues required to complete tasks, and errors made during tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The training group fared better in the first 3 days of using the system. There were significant recorded differences in number of cues required and errors committed between the two groups. By the fourth and fifth day of use, both groups were performing at the same level when using the system.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Supplementary basic smartphone training may be critical in trials where a smartphone app–based system for health intervention purposes is being introduced to a population that is not proficient with technology. This training could prevent early technology rejection and increase the engagement of older participants and their overall user experience with the system.",7
372,Development and Evaluation of an Accelerometer-Based Protocol for Measuring Physical Activity Levels in Cancer Survivors: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      The collection of self-reported physical activity using validated questionnaires has known bias and measurement error.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Accelerometry, an objective measure of daily activity, increases the rigor and accuracy of physical activity measurements. Here, we describe the methodology and related protocols for accelerometry data collection and quality assurance using the Actigraph GT9X accelerometer data collection in a convenience sample of ovarian cancer survivors enrolled in GOG/NRG 0225, a 24-month randomized controlled trial of diet and physical activity intervention versus attention control.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From July 2015 to December 2019, accelerometers were mailed on 1337 separate occasions to 580 study participants to wear at 4 time points (baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months) for 7 consecutive days. Study staff contacted participants via telephone to confirm their availability to wear the accelerometers and reviewed instructions and procedures regarding the return of the accelerometers and assisted with any technology concerns.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We evaluated factors associated with wear compliance, including activity tracking, use of a mobile app, and demographic characteristics with chi-square tests and logistic regression. Compliant data, defined as ≥4 consecutive days with ≥10 hours daily wear time, exceeded 90% at all study time points. Activity tracking, but no other characteristics, was significantly associated with compliant data at all time points (P<.001). This implementation of data collection through accelerometry provided highly compliant and usable activity data in women who recently completed treatment for ovarian cancer.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The high compliance and data quality associated with this protocol suggest that it could be disseminated to support researchers who seek to collect robust objective activity data in cancer survivors residing in a wide geographic area.",6
373,IART: Inertial Assistant Referee and Trainer for Race Walking,"This paper presents IART, a novel inertial wearable system for automatic detection of infringements and analysis of sports performance in race walking. IART algorithms are developed from raw inertial measurements collected by a single sensor located at the bottom of the vertebral column (L5-S1). Two novel parameters are developed to estimate infringements: loss of ground contact time and loss of ground contact step classification; three classic parameters are indeed used to estimate performance: step length ratio, step cadence, and smoothness. From these parameters, five biomechanical indices customized for elite athletes are derived. The experimental protocol consists of four repetitions of a straight path of 300 m on a long-paved road, performed by nine elite athletes. Over a total of 1620 steps (54 sequences of 30 steps each), the average accuracy of correct detection of loss of ground contact events is equal to 99%, whereas the correct classification of the infringement is equal to 87% for each step sequence, with a 92% of acceptable classifications. A great emphasis is dedicated on the user-centered development of IART: an intuitive radar chart representation is indeed developed to provide practical usability and interpretation of IART indices from the athletes, coaches, and referees perspectives. The results of IART, in terms of accuracy of its indices and usability from end-users, are encouraging for its usage as tool to support athletes and coaches in training and referees in real competitions.",3
374,Wearables: An R Package With Accompanying Shiny Application for Signal Analysis of a Wearable Device Targeted at Clinicians and Researchers,"Physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) that were traditionally studied in neuroscientific laboratory research are currently being used in numerous real-life studies using wearable technology. Physiological signals obtained with wearables seem to offer great potential for continuous monitoring and providing biofeedback in clinical practice and healthcare research. The physiological data obtained from these signals has utility for both clinicians and researchers. Clinicians are typically interested in the day-to-day and moment-to-moment physiological reactivity of patients to real-life stressors, events, and situations or interested in the physiological reactivity to stimuli in therapy. Researchers typically apply signal analysis methods to the data by pre-processing the physiological signals, detecting artifacts, and extracting features, which can be a challenge considering the amount of data that needs to be processed. This paper describes the creation of a ""Wearables"" R package and a Shiny ""E4 dashboard"" application for an often-studied wearable, the Empatica E4. The package and Shiny application can be used to visualize the relationship between physiological signals and real-life stressors or stimuli, but can also be used to pre-process physiological data, detect artifacts, and extract relevant features for further analysis. In addition, the application has a batch process option to analyze large amounts of physiological data into ready-to-use data files. The software accommodates users with a downloadable report that provides opportunities for a careful investigation of physiological reactions in daily life. The application is freely available, thought to be easy to use, and thought to be easily extendible to other wearable devices. Future research should focus on the usability of the application and the validation of the algorithms.",3
375,Post-Operative Remote Monitoring for Same-Day Discharge Elective Orthopedic Surgery: A Pilot Study,"The purposes of this pilot study are to utilize digital remote monitoring to (a) evaluate the usability and satisfaction of a wireless blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) monitor and (b) determine whether these data can enable safe mobilization at home after same-day discharge (SDD) joint replacement. A population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real-time data capture. Patients took three readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria applied, patients followed a hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using descriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean ""ease of use"" rating was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring after SDD arthroplasty. All patients with symptoms of hypotension were successfully remotely managed using a standardized hydration protocol prior to safe mobilization.",8
376,Multimodal nocturnal seizure detection in a residential care setting: A long-term prospective trial,"Objective:
        
      
      To develop and prospectively evaluate a method of epileptic seizure detection combining heart rate and movement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this multicenter, in-home, prospective, video-controlled cohort study, nocturnal seizures were detected by heart rate (photoplethysmography) or movement (3-D accelerometry) in persons with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Participants with >1 monthly major seizure wore a bracelet (Nightwatch) on the upper arm at night for 2 to 3 months. Major seizures were tonic-clonic, generalized tonic >30 seconds, hyperkinetic, or others, including clusters (>30 minutes) of short myoclonic/tonic seizures. The video of all events (alarms, nurse diaries) and 10% completely screened nights were reviewed to classify major (needing an alarm), minor (needing no alarm), or no seizure. Reliability was tested by interobserver agreement. We determined device performance, compared it to a bed sensor (Emfit), and evaluated the caregivers' user experience.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-eight of 34 admitted participants (1,826 nights, 809 major seizures) completed the study. Interobserver agreement (major/no major seizures) was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.89). Median sensitivity per participant amounted to 86% (95% CI 77%-93%); the false-negative alarm rate was 0.03 per night (95% CI 0.01-0.05); and the positive predictive value was 49% (95% CI 33%-64%). The multimodal sensor showed a better sensitivity than the bed sensor (n = 14, median difference 58%, 95% CI 39%-80%, p < 0.001). The caregivers' questionnaire (n = 33) indicated good sensor acceptance and usability according to 28 and 27 participants, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Combining heart rate and movement resulted in reliable detection of a broad range of nocturnal seizures.",5
377,Learning From Older Adults to Promote Independent Physical Activity Using Mobile Health (mHealth),"Background: Healthy aging is critically important for several reasons, including economic impact and quality of life. As the population of older adults rapidly increases, identifying acceptable ways to promote healthy aging is a priority. Technologies that can facilitate health promotion and risk reduction behaviors may be a solution, but only if these mobile health (mHealth) tools can be used by the older adult population. Within the context of a physical activity intervention, this study gathered participant's opinions about the use of an mHealth device to learn about acceptance and to identify areas for improvement. Methods: The Independent Walking for Brain Health study (NCT03058146) was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a wearable mHealth technology in facilitating adherence to a physical activity prescription among participants in free-living environments. An Exit Survey was conducted following intervention completion to gauge participant's perceptions and solicit feedback regarding the overall study design, including exercise promotion strategies and concerns specific to the technology (e.g., privacy), that could inform more acceptable mHealth interventions in the future. The Digital Health Checklist and Framework was used to guide the analysis focusing on the domains of Privacy, Access and Usability, and Data Management. Results: Participants (n = 41) were in their early 70's (mean = 71.6) and were predominantly female (75.6%) and White (92.7%). Most were college educated (16.9 years) and enjoyed using technology in their everyday life (85.4%). Key challenges included privacy concerns, device accuracy, usability, and data access. Specifically, participants want to know what is being learned about them and want control over how their identifiable data may be used. Overall, participants were able to use the device despite the design challenges. Conclusions: Understanding participant's perceptions of the challenges and concerns introduced by mHealth is important, as acceptance will influence adoption and adherence to the study protocol. While this study learned from participants at studycompletion, we recommend that researchers consider what might influence participant acceptance of the technology (access, data management, privacy, risks) and build these into the mHealth study design process. We provide recommendations for future mHealth studies with older adults.",2
378,Personal Health Data: Access and Perceived Value in Denmark,"This study explores how accessible and valuable Personal Health Data are in Denmark. This paper uses a qualitative inquiry which was adopted to provide information about (1) the accessibility of data available, (2) and the perceived value of data by recruiting 8 healthy Danish individuals who were instructed to access their personal health data, and were then prompted to discuss how accessible and valuable they perceived their personal health data to be. In total, participants accessed 31 datasets and wearable sensor data through 23 web applications and 8 mobile applications. They reported on search and access challenges in interviews and through journaling. Our results suggest that participants were satisfied with the access they had to their personal health data, however the participants expressed disappointment in ways the data was presented for them by the services and platforms. Thus, we concluded that the perceived value of personal data were found to be dependent on the usability and personalization features of the services, rather than on the data itself.",2
379,Twelve-Lead Electrocardiogram Acquisition With a Patchy-Type Wireless Device in Ambulance Transport: Simulation-Based Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Early recognition, diagnosis, and reperfusion are the key elements of treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The absence of a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (P12ECG) can cause definitive treatment delay and repeated transfer. Although guidelines highly recommend the measurement and transmission of P12ECG data, P12ECG use has not been widely established.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to verify the time-efficiency and feasibility of the use of a patchy-type 12-lead ECG measuring and transmitting device (P-ECG) by an emergency medical technician (EMT) in an ambulance during patient transport.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a simulation-based prospective randomized crossover-controlled study that included EMTs. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A began the experiment with a conventional 12-lead ECG (C-ECG) device and then switched to the intervention device (P-ECG), whereas group B began the experiment with the P-ECG and then switched to the C-ECG. All simulations were performed inside an ambulance driving at 30 km/h. The time interval was measured from the beginning of ECG application to completion of sending the results. After the simulation, participants were administered the System Usability Scale questionnaire about usability of the P-ECG.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 18 EMTs were recruited for this study with a median age of 35 years. The overall interval time for the C-ECG was 254 seconds (IQR 247-270), whereas the overall interval time for the P-ECG was 130 seconds (IQR 112-150), with a significant difference (P<.001). Significant differences between the C-ECG and P-ECG were identified at all time intervals, in which the P-ECG device was significantly faster in all intervals, except for the preparation interval in which the C-ECG was faster (P=.03).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Performance of 12-lead ECG examination and transmission of the results using P-ECG are faster than those of C-ECG during ambulance transport. With the additional time afforded, EMTs can provide more care to patients and transport patients more rapidly, which may help reduce the symptoms-to-balloon time for patients with acute coronary syndrome.

380,Performance Evaluation of Mixed Reality Display for Guidance During Transcatheter Cardiac Mapping and Ablation,"Cardiac electrophysiology procedures present the physician with a wealth of 3D information, typically presented on fixed 2D monitors. New developments in wearable mixed reality displays offer the potential to simplify and enhance 3D visualization while providing hands-free, dynamic control of devices within the procedure room.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This work aims to evaluate the performance and quality of a mixed reality system designed for intraprocedural use in cardiac electrophysiology.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The Enhanced Electrophysiology Visualization and Interaction System (ĒLVIS) mixed reality system performance criteria, including image quality, hardware performance, and usability were evaluated using existing display validation procedures adapted to the electrophysiology specific use case. Additional performance and user validation were performed through a 10 patient, in-human observational study, the Engineering ĒLVIS (E2) Study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ĒLVIS system achieved acceptable frame rate, latency, and battery runtime with acceptable dynamic range and depth distortion as well as minimal geometric distortion. Bench testing results corresponded with physician feedback in the observational study, and potential improvements in geometric understanding were noted.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The ĒLVIS system, based on current commercially available mixed reality hardware, is capable of meeting the hardware performance, image quality, and usability requirements of the electroanatomic mapping display for intraprocedural, real-time use in electrophysiology procedures. Verifying off the shelf mixed reality hardware for specific clinical use can accelerate the adoption of this transformative technology and provide novel visualization, understanding, and control of clinically relevant data in real-time.",4
381,Characterization and wearability evaluation of a fully portable wrist exoskeleton for unsupervised training after stroke,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic hand and wrist impairment are frequently present following stroke and severely limit independence in everyday life. The wrist orientates and stabilizes the hand before and during grasping, and is therefore of critical importance in activities of daily living (ADL). To improve rehabilitation outcomes, classical therapy could be supplemented by novel therapies that can be applied in unsupervised settings. This would enable more distributed practice and could potentially increase overall training dose. Robotic technology offers new possibilities to address this challenge, but it is critical that devices for independent training are easy and appealing to use. Here, we present the development, characterization and wearability evaluation of a fully portable exoskeleton for active wrist extension/flexion support in stroke rehabilitation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      First we defined the requirements, and based on these, constructed the exoskeleton. We then characterized the device with standardized haptic and human-robot interaction metrics. The exoskeleton is composed of two modules placed on the forearm/hand and the upper arm. These modules weigh 238 g and 224 g, respectively. The forearm module actively supports wrist extension and flexion with a torque up to 3.7 Nm and an angular velocity up to 530 deg/s over a range of 154∘. The upper arm module includes the control electronics and battery, which can power the device for about 125 min in normal use. Special emphasis was put on independent donning and doffing of the device, which was tested via a wearability evaluation in 15 healthy participants and 2 stroke survivors using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All participants were able to independently don and doff the device after only 4 practice trials. For healthy participants the donning and doffing process took 61 ±15 s and 24 ±6 s, respectively. The two stroke survivors donned and doffed the exoskeleton in 54 s/22 s and 113 s/32 s, respectively. Usability questionnaires revealed that despite minor difficulties, all participants were positive regarding the device.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study describes an actuated wrist exoskeleton which weighs less than 500 g, and which is easy and fast to don and doff with one hand. Our design has put special emphasis on the donning aspect of robotic devices which constitutes the first barrier a user will face in unsupervised settings. The proposed device is a first and intermediate step towards wearable rehabilitation technologies that can be used independently by the patient and in unsupervised settings.",3
382,Quantifying head acceleration exposure via instrumented mouthguards (iMG): a validity and feasibility study protocol to inform iMG suitability for the TaCKLE project,"Instrumented mouthguards (iMGs) have the potential to quantify head acceleration exposures in sport. The Rugby Football League is looking to deploy iMGs to quantify head acceleration exposures as part of the Tackle and Contact Kinematics, Loads and Exposure (TaCKLE) project. iMGs and associated software platforms are novel, thus limited validation studies exist. The aim of this paper is to describe the methods that will determine the validity (ie, laboratory validation of kinematic measures and on-field validity) and feasibility (ie, player comfort and wearability and practitioner considerations) of available iMGs for quantifying head acceleration events in rugby league. Phase 1 will determine the reliability and validity of iMG kinematic measures (peak linear acceleration, peak rotational velocity, peak rotational acceleration), based on laboratory criterion standards. Players will have three-dimensional dental scans and be provided with available iMGs for phase 2 and phase 3. Phase 2 will determine the on-field validity of iMGs (ie, identifying true positive head acceleration events during a match). Phase 3 will evaluate player perceptions of fit (too loose, too tight, bulky, small/thin, held mouth open, held teeth apart, pain in jaw muscles, uneven bite), comfort (on lips, gum, tongue, teeth) and function (speech, swallowing, dry mouth). Phase 4 will evaluate the practical feasibility of iMGs, as determined by practitioners using the system usability scale (preparing iMG system and managing iMG data). The outcome will provide a systematic and robust assessment of a range of iMGs, which will help inform the suitability of each iMG system for the TaCKLE project.",7
383,"Effects of Two Passive Back-Support Exoskeletons on Muscle Activity, Energy Expenditure, and Subjective Assessments During Repetitive Lifting","Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of two different passive back-support exoskeleton (BSE) designs during repetitive lifting in different postures.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Although BSEs have been proposed as a potential intervention for reducing physical demands, limited information is available about the impacts of different exoskeleton designs in diverse work scenarios.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Eighteen participants (gender-balanced) performed lab-based simulations of repetitive lifting tasks. These tasks were performed in 12 different conditions, involving two BSEs and a control condition, two levels of lifting symmetry (symmetric and asymmetric), and two postures (standing and kneeling). Outcome measures described muscle activity and energy expenditure, along with perceived discomfort, balance, and usability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using both BSEs significantly reduced peak activity of the trunk extensor muscles (by ~10%-28%) and energy expenditure (by ~4%-13%) in all conditions tested. Such reductions, though, were task dependent and differed between the two BSEs. In most of the tested conditions, using BSEs positively affected subjective responses regarding perceived exertion and usability.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of a BSE are task specific and depend on the specific BSE design approach. More work is needed, though, to better characterize this task specificity and to determine the generalizability of BSE effects on objective and subjective outcomes for a wider range of conditions and users.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Our results provide new evidence to guide the selection and application of passive BSE designs in diverse lifting tasks.",0
384,Twisting and Braiding Fluid-Driven Soft Artificial Muscle Fibers for Robotic Applications,"Research on soft artificial muscles (SAMs) is rapidly growing, both in developing new actuation ideas and improving existing structures with multifunctionality. The human body has more than 600 muscles that drive organs and joints to achieve desired functions. Inspired by the human muscles, this article presents a new type of SAM fiber formed from twisting and braiding soft hydraulic filament artificial muscles with high aspect ratio, high strain, and high energy efficiency. We systematically investigated the relationship between input pressure and output elongation as well as contraction force of the new muscles using different configurations in terms of an array of single and multiple muscles arranged in nontwisting (or straight), twisting, and braiding variants. Experimental results revealed that the twisting and braiding configurations greatly enhanced the muscle elongation and generated force compared with their nontwisting/braiding counterparts. To demonstrate the new muscles' usability, we implemented several muscle variants to bidirectionally manipulate 3D-printed human fingers and elbow, mimicking the human upper limb with a full range of motion. We also created a bioinspired growing soft tubular muscle that could simultaneously exert longitudinal and radial expansion upon pressurization, similar to that of auxetic metamaterial structures. The new growing soft tubular muscles were experimentally validated and the results showed that they could be potentially implemented in several emerging applications, including smart compression garments, stent-like supporting devices, and tubular grippers for medical use.",0
385,Assessing the Clinical Utility of a Wearable Device for Physiological Monitoring of Heart Rate Variability in Military Service Members with Traumatic Brain Injury,"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Autonomic dysfunction has been implicated as a consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Heart rate variability (HRV) may be a viable measure of autonomic dysfunction that could enhance rehabilitative interventions for individuals with TBI. This pilot study sought to assess the feasibility and validity of using the Zeriscope™ platform system in a real-world clinical setting to measure HRV in active-duty service members with TBI who were participating in an intensive outpatient program. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Twenty-five service members with a history of mild, moderate, or severe TBI were recruited from a military treatment facility. A baseline assessment was conducted in the cardiology clinic where point validity data were obtained by comparing a 5-min recording of a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) output against the Zeriscope platform data. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Compared with the ECG device, the Zeriscope device had a concordance coefficient (<i>rc</i>) of 0.16, falling below the standard deemed to represent acceptable accuracy in HR measurement (i.e., 0.80). Follow-up analyses excluding outliers did not significantly improve the concordance coefficient to an acceptable standard for the total participant sample. System Usability Survey responses showed that participants rated the Zeriscope system as easy to use and something that most people would learn to use quickly. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study demonstrated promise in ambulatory HRV measurement in a representative military TBI sample. Future research should include further refinement of such ambulatory devices to meet the specifications required for use in a military active-duty TBI population.",8
386,Lessons Learned: Beta-Testing the Digital Health Checklist for Researchers Prompts a Call to Action by Behavioral Scientists,"Digital technologies offer unique opportunities for health research. For example, Twitter posts can support public health surveillance to identify outbreaks (eg, influenza and COVID-19), and a wearable fitness tracker can provide real-time data collection to assess the effectiveness of a behavior change intervention. With these opportunities, it is necessary to consider the potential risks and benefits to research participants when using digital tools or strategies. Researchers need to be involved in the risk assessment process, as many tools in the marketplace (eg, wellness apps, fitness sensors) are underregulated. However, there is little guidance to assist researchers and institutional review boards in their evaluation of digital tools for research purposes. To address this gap, the Digital Health Checklist for Researchers (DHC-R) was developed as a decision support tool. A participatory research approach involving a group of behavioral scientists was used to inform DHC-R development. Scientists beta-tested the checklist by retrospectively evaluating the technologies they had chosen for use in their research. This paper describes the lessons learned because of their involvement in the beta-testing process and concludes with recommendations for how the DHC-R could be useful for a variety of digital health stakeholders. Recommendations focus on future research and policy development to support research ethics, including the development of best practices to advance safe and responsible digital health research.",2
387,Studying third-parties and environments: New Zealand sun-safety research,"Wearable cameras have been used to study health behaviours, but their utility in assessing third-party behaviours and the built environment is uncertain. This paper reports on the feasibility of using wearable cameras for this purpose in a study of sun-protective behaviours and shade availability during school lunch-breaks. The Kids'Cam study provided 168 children (aged 11-13 years), recruited from 16 randomly selected schools in the Wellington region of New Zealand, with wearable cameras. The devices automatically captured images every 7 s from the child's perspective. Images captured during school lunch-breaks by a random sample of 15 children who took part during terms 4 and 1 (October 2014-April 2015) were selected and assessed for usability. The feasibility of studying third-party sun-protective behaviours and school shade availability was assessed for a subset of 320 images. Of the 3492 eligible lunch-break images, 96.4% were useable; the remainders were excluded due to obstruction, blurriness or unsuitable camera position. Overall, 1278 children and 108 shade structures were observed in the sample images. The use of shade, hats, sleeves, collars and sunglasses could be determined for 97.0%, 77.2%, 74.4%, 47.6% and 54.9% of children, respectively. All shade structures could be classified according to type, and canopy composition could be assessed for 95.4% of structures. Wearable cameras are a feasible tool for assessing sun-safety, particularly shade availability, hat wearing and shade use. This methodology could be used to objectively study other third-party health-related behaviours, and other features of the built environment.",2
388,Evaluative Research of Technologies for Prehospital Communication and Coordination: a Systematic Review,"Various technologies have been designed and developed to support communication and coordination between the field and hospital during a medical emergency. The usability issues and human factors entailed in these new technologies are important to their application and effectiveness, suggesting the need to examine this information in a systematic review. The systematic review aims to synthesize the user-centered evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies. We conducted a systematic literature search in four databases (Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science) for articles published between the years 2000 and 2019. We included articles that evaluated the technologies developed for supporting prehospital communication and collaboration, and were published in English. A total of 918 articles were retrieved and screened, with 17 articles included for in-depth analysis. Two authors conducted independent screens and reviews of the articles using a list of inclusion/exclusion criteria and defined factors. The types of technology of reviewed articles included ambulance-based telemedicine, wearable, handheld, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Even though these technologies have demonstrated high levels of user acceptance, the reviewed studies noted a variety of challenges faced by emergency care providers, which were grouped into three categories-technical, usability, and organizational challenges. Our review also highlighted the paucity of evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies and the lack of user engagement throughout system design process. Based on the results, we discuss the importance of adopting user-centered design approaches and accounting for three social-technical factors in designing technologies for time-critical medical settings, including cognitive and physical stressor, workflow, and context. This systematic review presents an overview of key evaluative research of prehospital communication technologies. The paucity of evaluative research in prehospital communication technology and challenges faced in adopting advanced technological solutions in emergency care highlight the need to adopt user-centered design and take into account socio-technical issues at the point of system design.",4
389,Improving the user experience of televisits and telemonitoring for heart failure patients in less than 6 months: a methodological approach,"Background:
        
      
      With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the designed method with other categories of chronic patients.",0
390,Progress in ambient assisted systems for independent living by the elderly,"One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.",2
391,Measuring Free-Living Physical Activity With Three Commercially Available Activity Monitors for Telemonitoring Purposes: Validation Study,"Background:
        
      
      Remote monitoring of physical activity in patients with chronic conditions could be useful to offer care professionals real-time assessment of their patient's daily activity pattern to adjust appropriate treatment. However, the validity of commercially available activity trackers that can be used for telemonitoring purposes is limited.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to test usability and determine the validity of 3 consumer-level activity trackers as a measure of free-living activity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A usability evaluation (study 1) and validation study (study 2) were conducted. In study 1, 10 individuals wore one activity tracker for a period of 30 days and filled in a questionnaire on ease of use and wearability. In study 2, we validated three selected activity trackers (Apple Watch, Misfit Shine, and iHealth Edge) and a fourth pedometer (Yamax Digiwalker) against the reference standard (Actigraph GT3X) in 30 healthy participants for 72 hours. Outcome measures were 95% limits of agreement (LoA) and bias (Bland-Altman analysis). Furthermore, median absolute differences (MAD) were calculated. Correction for bias was estimated and validated using leave-one-out cross validation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Usability evaluation of study 1 showed that iHealth Edge and Apple Watch were more comfortable to wear as compared with the Misfit Flash. Therefore, the Misfit Flash was replaced by Misfit Shine in study 2. During study 2, the total number of steps of the reference standard was 21,527 (interquartile range, IQR 17,475-24,809). Bias and LoA for number of steps from the Apple Watch and iHealth Edge were 968 (IQR -5478 to 7414) and 2021 (IQR -4994 to 9036) steps. For Misfit Shine and Yamax Digiwalker, bias was -1874 and 2004, both with wide LoA of (13,869 to 10,121) and (-10,932 to 14,940) steps, respectively. The Apple Watch noted the smallest MAD of 7.7% with the Actigraph, whereas the Yamax Digiwalker noted the highest MAD (20.3%). After leave-one-out cross validation, accuracy estimates of MAD of the iHealth Edge and Misfit Shine were within acceptable limits with 10.7% and 11.3%, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, the Apple Watch and iHealth Edge were positively evaluated after wearing. Validity varied widely between devices, with the Apple Watch being the most accurate and Yamax Digiwalker the least accurate for step count in free-living conditions. The iHealth Edge underestimates number of steps but can be considered reliable for activity monitoring after correction for bias. Misfit Shine overestimated number of steps and cannot be considered suitable for step count because of the low agreement. Future studies should focus on the added value of remotely monitoring activity patterns over time in chronic patients.",1
392,A Real-Time Mobile Intervention to Reduce Sedentary Behavior Before and After Cancer Surgery: Usability and Feasibility Study,"Background:
        
      
      Sedentary behavior (SB) is common after cancer surgery and may negatively affect recovery and quality of life, but postoperative symptoms such as pain can be a significant barrier to patients achieving recommended physical activity levels. We conducted a single-arm pilot trial evaluating the usability and acceptability of a real-time mobile intervention that detects prolonged SB in the perioperative period and delivers prompts to walk that are tailored to daily self-reported symptom burden.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to develop and test a mobile technology-supported intervention to reduce SB before and after cancer surgery, and to evaluate the usability and feasibility of the intervention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 15 patients scheduled for abdominal cancer surgery consented to the study, which involved using a Fitbit smartwatch with a companion smartphone app across the perioperative period (from a minimum of 2 weeks before surgery to 30 days postdischarge). Participants received prompts to walk after any SB that exceeded a prespecified threshold, which varied from day to day based on patient-reported symptom severity. Participants also completed weekly semistructured interviews to collect information on usability, acceptability, and experience using the app and smartphone; in addition, smartwatch logs were examined to assess participant study compliance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of eligible patients approached, 79% (15/19) agreed to participate. Attrition was low (1/15, 7%) and due to poor health and prolonged hospitalization. Participants rated (0-100) the smartphone and smartwatch apps as very easy (mean 92.3 and 93.2, respectively) and pleasant to use (mean 93.0 and 93.2, respectively). Overall satisfaction with the whole system was 89.9, and the mean System Usability Scale score was 83.8 out of 100. Overall compliance with symptom reporting was 51% (469/927 days), decreasing significantly from before surgery (264/364, 73%) to inpatient recovery (32/143, 22%) and postdischarge (173/420, 41%). Overall Fitbit compliance was 70% (653/927 days) but also declined from before surgery (330/364, 91%) to inpatient (51/143, 36%) and postdischarge (272/420, 65%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Perioperative patients with cancer were willing to use a smartwatch- and smartphone-based real-time intervention to reduce SB, and they rated the apps as very easy and pleasant to use. Compliance with the intervention declined significantly after surgery. The effects of the intervention on postoperative activity patterns, recovery, and quality of life will be evaluated in an ongoing randomized trial.",8
393,Toward a Digital Health Intervention for Vestibular Rehabilitation: Usability and Subjective Outcomes of a Novel Platform,"Digital technologies are increasingly available and are reducing in cost. There is an opportunity to move to a digital health approach in vestibular rehabilitation (VR), but there is a paucity of suitable systems available and a consequent lack of evidence to support their use. This study aimed to investigate a novel digital platform developed specifically for VR (comprising clinician software, a wearable sensor, and a patient-facing app). Participants (n = 14, 9F:5M, mean age 59) with vestibular dysfunction and imbalance used the app for treatment, and therapists (n = 4) used the platform to deliver VR in the form of individualized exercise programmes over a mean of 17.4 ± 8.8 weeks. Outcomes included the system usability scale, the patient enablement instrument (PEI), change in subjective symptoms (numerical rating scales), percentage adherence to prescribed exercise, and a semi-structured interview on utility. A significant reduction was found in symptoms of vertigo/dizziness (p < 0.004), imbalance (p < 0.002), oscillopsia (p < 0.04), and anxiety (p < 0.02) after use. System usability scores were high for both clinicians (mean 85/100) and participants (mean 82.7/100) and high enablement was reported (mean PEI 6.5/12). Overall percentage adherence to the exercise prescription was highly variable and ranged from 4 to 78% when measured digitally. At semi-structured interviews, participants reported a high level of acceptance and satisfaction with digital delivery, and no adverse events were recorded. When COVID-19 restrictions eased, 2 participants trialed the head sensor with the application and found it highly usable. Further research is required to investigate the efficacy and how the wearable sensor impacts the delivery of care.",2
394,Diabetes Educators' Insights Regarding Connecting Mobile Phone- and Wearable Tracker-Collected Self-Monitoring Information to a Nationally-Used Electronic Health Record System for Diabetes Education: Descriptive Qualitative Study,"Background:
        
      
      Diabetes educators are integral to a clinical team in providing diabetes self-management education and support; however, current mobile and Web-based self-management tools are not integrated into clinical diabetes care to support diabetes educators' education efforts.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of our study was to seek diabetes educators' insights regarding the development of an interface within the Chronicle Diabetes system, a nationally used electronic health record (EHR) system for diabetes education documentation with behavioral goal-setting functions, to transfer mobile phone- and wearable tracker-collected self-monitoring information from patients to diabetes educators to facilitate behavioral goal monitoring.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A descriptive qualitative study was conducted to seek educators' perspectives on usability and interface development preferences in developing a connected system. Educators can use the Chronicle Diabetes system to set behavioral goals with their patients. Individual and group interviews were used to seek educators' preferences for viewing mobile phone- and wearable tracker-collected information on diet, physical activity, and sleep in the Chronicle Diabetes system using open-ended questions. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for common themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five common themes emerged from the discussion. First, educators expressed enthusiasm for and concerns about viewing diet and physical activity data in Chronicle Diabetes system. Second, educators valued viewing detailed dietary macronutrients and activity data; however, they preferred different kinds of details depending on patients' needs, conditions, and behavioral goals and educators' training background. Third, all educators liked the integration of mobile phone-collected data into Chronicle Diabetes system and preferably with current EHR systems. Fourth, a need for a health care team and a central EHR system to be formed was realized for educators to share summaries of self-monitoring data with other providers. Fifth, educators desired advanced features for the mobile app and the connected interface that can show self-monitoring data.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Flexibility is needed for educators to track the details of mobile phone- and wearable tracker-collected diet and activity information, and the integration of such data into Chronicle Diabetes and EHR systems is valuable for educators to track patients' behavioral goals, provide diabetes self-management education and support, and share data with other health care team members to faciliate team-based care in clinical practice.",2
395,Increased Symmetry of Lower-Limb Amputees Walking With Concurrent Bilateral Vibrotactile Feedback,"Gait asymmetry in lower-limb amputees can lead to several secondary conditions that can decrease general health and quality of life. Including augmented sensory feedback in rehabilitation programs can effectively mitigate spatiotemporal gait irregularities. Such benefits can be obtained with non-invasive haptic systems representing an advantageous choice for usability in overground training and every-day life. In this study, we tested a wearable tactile feedback device delivering short-lasting (100ms) vibrations around the waist syncronized to gait events, to improve the temporal gait symmetry of lower-limb amputees. Three above-knee amputees participated in the study. The device provided bilateral stimulations during a training program that involved ground-level gait training. After three training sessions, participants showed higher temporal symmetry when walking with the haptic feedback in comparison to their natural walking (resulting symmetry index increases of +2.8% for Subject IDA, +12.7% for Subject IDB and +2.9% for Subject IDC). One subject retained improved symmetry (Subject IDB,+14.9%) even when walking without the device. Gait analyses revealed that higher temporal symmetry may lead to concurrent compensation strategies in the trunk and pelvis. Overall, the results of this pilot study confirm the potential utility of sensory feedback devices to positively influence gait parameters when used in supervised settings. Future studies shall clarify more precisely the training modalities and the targets of rehabilitation programs with such devices.",7
396,Feasibility of Sensor Technology for Balance Assessment in Home Rehabilitation Settings,"The increased use of sensor technology has been crucial in releasing the potential for remote rehabilitation. However, it is vital that human factors, that have potential to affect real-world use, are fully considered before sensors are adopted into remote rehabilitation practice. The smart sensor devices for rehabilitation and connected health (SENDoc) project assesses the human factors associated with sensors for remote rehabilitation of elders in the Northern Periphery of Europe. This article conducts a literature review of human factors and puts forward an objective scoring system to evaluate the feasibility of balance assessment technology for adaption into remote rehabilitation settings. The main factors that must be considered are: Deployment constraints, usability, comfort and accuracy. This article shows that improving accuracy, reliability and validity is the main goal of research focusing on developing novel balance assessment technology. However, other aspects of usability related to human factors such as practicality, comfort and ease of use need further consideration by researchers to help advance the technology to a state where it can be applied in remote rehabilitation settings.",2
397,Computationally Efficient 3D Orientation Tracking Using Gyroscope Measurements,"Computationally efficient 3D orientation (3DO) tracking using gyroscope angular velocity measurements enables a short execution time and low energy consumption for the computing device. These are essential requirements in today's wearable device environments, which are characterized by limited resources and demands for high energy autonomy. We show that the computational efficiency of 3DO tracking is significantly improved by correctly interpreting each triplet of gyroscope measurements as simultaneous (using the rotation vector called the Simultaneous Orthogonal Rotation Angle, or SORA) rather than as sequential (using Euler angles) rotation. For an example rotation of 90°, depending on the change in the rotation axis, using Euler angles requires 35 to 78 times more measurement steps for comparable levels of accuracy, implying a higher sampling frequency and computational complexity. In general, the higher the demanded 3DO accuracy, the higher the computational advantage of using the SORA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 12 to 14 times faster execution is achieved by adapting the SORA-based 3DO tracking to the architecture of the executing low-power ARM Cortex® M0+ microcontroller using only integer arithmetic, lookup tables, and the small-angle approximation. Finally, we show that the computational efficiency is further improved by choosing the appropriate 3DO computational method. Using rotation matrices is 1.85 times faster than using rotation quaternions when 3DO calculations are performed for each measurement step. On the other hand, using rotation quaternions is 1.75 times faster when only the final 3DO result of several consecutive rotations is needed. We conclude that by adopting the presented practices, the clock frequency of a processor computing the 3DO can be significantly reduced. This substantially prolongs the energy autonomy of the device and enhances its usability in day-to-day measurement scenarios.",7
398,"New measures of mental state and behavior based on data collected from sensors, smartphones, and the Internet","With the rapid and ubiquitous acceptance of new technologies, algorithms will be used to estimate new measures of mental state and behavior based on digital data. The algorithms will analyze data collected from sensors in smartphones and wearable technology, and data collected from Internet and smartphone usage and activities. In the future, new medical measures that assist with the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of psychiatric disorders will be available despite unresolved reliability, usability, and privacy issues. At the same time, similar non-medical commercial measures of mental state are being developed primarily for targeted advertising. There are societal and ethical implications related to the use of these measures of mental state and behavior for both medical and non-medical purposes.",4
399,Seizure detection at home: Do devices on the market match the needs of people living with epilepsy and their caregivers?,"In patients with epilepsy, the potential to prevent seizure-related injuries and to improve the unreliability of seizure self-report have fostered the development and marketing of numerous seizure detection devices for home use. Understanding the requirements of users (patients and caregivers) is essential to improve adherence and mitigate barriers to the long-term use of such devices. Here we reviewed the evidence on the needs and preferences of users and provided an overview of currently marketed devices for seizure detection (medically approved or with published evidence for their performance). We then compared devices with known needs. Seizure-detection devices are expected to improve safety and clinical and self-management, and to provide reassurance to users. Key factors affecting a device's usability relate to its design (attractive appearance, low visibility, low intrusiveness), comfort of use, confidentiality of recorded data, and timely support from both technical and clinical ends. High detection sensitivity and low false alarm rates are paramount. Currently marketed devices are focused primarily on the recording of non-electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated with tonic-clonic seizures, whereas the detection of focal seizures without major motor features remains a clear evidence gap. Moreover, there is paucity of evidence coming from real-life settings. A joint effort of clinical and nonclinical experts, patients, and caregivers is required to ensure an optimal level of acceptability and usability, which are key aspects for a successful continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection at home.",1
400,A wireless body measurement system to study fatigue in multiple sclerosis,"Fatigue is reported as the most common symptom by patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The physiological and functional parameters related to fatigue in MS patients are currently not well established. A new wearable wireless body measurement system, named Fatigue Monitoring System (FAMOS), was developed to study fatigue in MS. It can continuously measure electrocardiogram, body-skin temperature, electromyogram and motions of feet. The goal of this study is to test the ability of distinguishing fatigued MS patients from healthy subjects by the use of FAMOS. This paper presents the realization of the measurement system including the design of both hardware and dedicated signal processing algorithms. Twenty-six participants including 17 MS patients with fatigue and 9 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study for continuous 24 h monitoring. The preliminary results show significant differences between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, the FAMOS enables continuous data acquisition and estimation of multiple physiological and functional parameters. It provides a new, flexible and objective approach to study fatigue in MS, which can distinguish between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. The usability and reliability of the FAMOS should however be further improved and validated through larger clinical trials.",0
401,Pervasive assistive technology for people with dementia: a UCD case,"Smart mobile and wearable technology offers exciting opportunities to support people with dementia (PwD). Its ubiquity and popularity could even benefit user adoption - a great challenge for assistive technology (AT) for PwD that calls for user-centred design (UCD) methods. This study describes a user-centred approach to developing and testing AT based on off-the-shelf pervasive technologies. A prototype is created by combining a smartphone, smartwatch and various applications to offer six support features. This is tested among five end-users (PwD) and their caregivers. Controlled usability testing was followed by field testing in a real-world context. Data is gathered from video recordings, interaction logs, system usability scale questionnaires, logbooks, application usage logs and interviews structured on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. The data is analysed to evaluate usability, usefulness and user acceptance. Results show some promise for user adoption, but highlight challenges to be overcome, emphasising personalisation and familiarity as key considerations. The complete findings regarding usability issues, usefulness of support features and four identified adoption profiles are used to provide a set of recommendations for practitioners and further research. These contribute toward UCD practices for improved smart, pervasive AT for dementia.",2
402,Objective assessment of movement competence in children using wearable sensors: An instrumented version of the TGMD-2 locomotor subtest,"Movement competence (MC) is defined as the development of sufficient skill to assure successful performance in different physical activities. Monitoring children MC during maturation is fundamental to detect early minor delays and define effective intervention. To this purpose, several MC assessment batteries are available. When evaluating movement strategies, with the aim of identifying specific skill components that may need improving, widespread MC assessment is limited by high time consumption for scoring and the need for trained operators to ensure reliability. This work aims to facilitate and support the assessment by designing, implementing and validating an instrumented version of the TGMD-2 locomotor subtest based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to quantify MC in children rapidly and objectively. 45 typically developing children, aged 6-10, performed the TGMD-2 locomotor subtest (six skills). During the tests, children wore five IMUs mounted on lower back, on ankles and on wrists. Sensor and video recordings of the tests were collected. Three expert evaluators performed the standard assessment of TGMD-2. Using theoretical and modelling approaches, algorithms were implemented to automatically score children tests based on IMUs' data. The automatic assessment, compared to the standard one, showed an agreement higher than 87% on average on the entire group for each skill and a reduction of time for scoring from 15 to 2min per participant. Results support the use of IMUs for MC assessment: this approach will allow improving the usability of MC assessment, supporting objectively evaluator decisions and reducing time requirement for the evaluation of large groups.",3
403,Pre-surgery Stress Monitoring Using Heart Rate Variability Measures,"Pre-surgery stress is common in patients hospitalized for undergoing surgeries. High levels of stress could prolong post-operative recovery time, increasing the duration of hospitalization. Abnormally high stress levels could sometimes have irreversible impacts, leading to post-operative physiological and psychological disorders. Continuous monitoring of patients during the pre-operative period could help in taking necessary measures to control the stress levels. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the signals which is usually monitored continuously for patients in clinical settings. The usability of ECG for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) based stress detection has been explored in this study. HRV features derived from ECG data acquired from 51 patients admitted in the surgical ward during their pre-operative phase were studied. The trend of the features showed similarity in pre-surgery stress experienced by the patients. Using chest leads connected by wires to a wrist wearable for collecting ECG was obtrusive to patients and resulted in loss of more than 50% of the data. Unobtrusive data collection using chest patches can make HRV based stress detection feasible for clinical use. However, an additional monitoring system would require additional responsibility on the part of the healthcare staff involved in patient care. Integrating the HRV based stress detection into the patient monitors already being used in these clinical settings could therefore make the monitoring of stress feasible.",5
404,Stroke Patients' Acceptance of a Smart Garment for Supporting Upper Extremity Rehabilitation,"The objective is to evaluate to which extent that Zishi a garment equipped with sensors that can support posture monitoring can be used in upper extremity rehabilitation training of stroke patients. Seventeen stroke survivors (mean age: 55 years old, SD =13.5) were recruited in three hospitals in Shanghai. Patients performed 4 tasks (analytical shoulder flexion, functional shoulder flexion placing a cooking pot, analytical flexion in the scapular plane, and functional flexion in the scapular plane placing a bottle of water) with guided feedback on a tablet that was provided through inertial sensors embedded in the Zishi system at the scapula and the thoracic spine region. After performing the training tasks, patients completed four questionnaires for assessing their motivation, their acceptance of the system, its credibility, and usability. The study participants were highly motivated to train with Zishi and the system was rated high usability, while the subjects had moderate confidence with technology supported training in comparison with the training with therapists. The patients respond positively to using Zishi to support rehabilitation training in a clinical setting. Further developments need to address more on engaging and adaptive feedback. This paper paves the way for larger scale effectiveness studies.",3
405,Eye Tracking in the Wild: Piloting a Real-Life Assessment Paradigm for Older Adults,"Previous research showed associations between personality traits and eye movements of young adults in the laboratory. However, less is known about these associations in real life and in older age. Primarily, there seems to be no paradigm to assess eye movements of older adults in real life. The present feasibility study thus aimed to test grocery shopping as a real-life assessment paradigm with older adults. Additionally, possible links between personality traits and eye movements were explored. The sample consisted of 38 older individuals (M = 72.85 years). Participants did their grocery shopping in a supermarket while wearing an eye tracker. Three key feasibility issues were examined, that is (1) wearability of the eye tracker during grocery shopping, (2) recording, and (3) evaluation of eye movements in a real-life context. Our real-life assessment paradigm showed to be feasible to implement and acceptable to older adults. This feasibility study provides specific practical recommendations which may be useful for future studies that plan to innovatively expand the traditional methods repertoire of personality science and aging research by using eye tracking in real life.",3
406,Harnessing Mobile Health Technology for Secondary Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Older Adults: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association,"Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is critical to improving health outcomes and quality of life in our aging population. As mobile health (mHealth) technology gains universal leverage and popularity, it is becoming more user-friendly for older adults and an adjunct to manage CVD risk and improve overall cardiovascular health. With the rapid advances in mHealth technology and increasing technological engagement of older adults, a comprehensive understanding of the current literature and knowledge of gaps and barriers surrounding the impact of mHealth on secondary CVD prevention is essential. After a systematic review of the literature, 26 studies that used mHealth for secondary CVD prevention focusing on lifestyle behavior change and medication adherence in cohorts with a mean age of ≥60 years were identified. Improvements in health behaviors and medication adherence were observed, particularly when there was a short message service (ie, texting) component involved. Although mobile technologies are becoming more mainstream and are starting to blend more seamlessly with standard health care, there are still distinct barriers that limit implementation particularly in older adults, including affordability, usability, privacy, and security issues. Furthermore, studies on the type of mHealth that is the most effective for older adults with longer study duration are essential as the field continues to grow. As our population ages, identifying and implementing effective, widely accepted, cost-effective, and time-efficient mHealth interventions to improve CVD health in a vulnerable demographic group should be a top health priority.",2
407,Leveraging Multi-Modal Sensing for Mobile Health: A Case Review in Chronic Pain,"Active and passive mobile sensing has garnered much attention in recent years. In this paper, we focus on chronic pain measurement and management as a case application to exemplify the state of the art. We present a consolidated discussion on the leveraging of various sensing modalities along with modular server-side and on-device architectures required for this task. Modalities included are: activity monitoring from accelerometry and location sensing, audio analysis of speech, image processing for facial expressions as well as modern methods for effective patient self-reporting. We review examples that deliver actionable information to clinicians and patients while addressing privacy, usability, and computational constraints. We also discuss open challenges in the higher level inferencing of patient state and effective feedback with potential directions to address them. The methods and challenges presented here are also generalizable and relevant to a broad range of other applications in mobile sensing.",2
408,Remote Patient Monitoring in Adults Receiving Transfusion or Infusion for Hematological Disorders Using the VitalPatch and accelerateIQ Monitoring System: Quantitative Feasibility Study,"Background:
        
      
      Frequent vital sign monitoring during and after transfusion of blood products and certain chemotherapies or immunotherapies is critical for detecting infusion reactions and treatment management in patients. Currently, patients return home with instructions to contact the clinic if they feel unwell. Continuous monitoring of vital signs for hematological patients treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy or receiving blood transfusions using wearable electronic biosensors during and post treatment may improve the safety of these treatments and make remote data collection in an outpatient care setting possible.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to evaluate patient experiences with the VitalPatch wearable sensor (VitalConnect) and to evaluate the usability of data generated by the physIQ accelerateIQ monitoring system for the investigator and nurse.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 12 patients with hematological disorders receiving red blood cell transfusions, an intravenous (IV) proteasome inhibitor, or an IV immunotherapy agent were included in the study and wore the VitalPatch for 12 days. Patients completed questionnaires focusing on wearability and nurses completed questionnaires focusing on the usability of the VitalPatch.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 12 patients were enrolled over 9 months, with 4 receiving red blood cell transfusions, 4 receiving IV proteasome inhibitors, and 4 receiving IV immunotherapy. These patients were treated for diseases such as multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Of these patients, 83% (10/12) were aged 60 years and older. A total of 4 patients (4/12, 33%) withdrew from the study (3 because of skin irritation and 1 because of patch connection issues). Patients wore biosensor patches at baseline and for 1-week post administration. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected at baseline, day 1, day 5, and day 8. No difference in the PRO was observed when nurses or patients applied the patch. PRO data indicated minimal impact on the patient's life. Ease of use, influence on sleep, impact on follow-up of health, or discomfort with continuous monitoring did not change between baseline and day 8. Changes in PRO were observed on day 5, where a 20% (2/10) increase in skin irritation was reported. Withdrawals because of skin irritation were reported in all cases when wearing the second patch. Nurses reported the placement of the VitalPatch to be easy and felt measurements to be reliable.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Generally, the VitalPatch was well tolerated and shown to be an attractive device because of its wearability and low impact on daily activities in patients, therefore making it suitable for implementation in future studies.",5
409,Validity of pervasive computing based continuous physical activity assessment in community-dwelling old and oldest-old,"In older adults, physical activity is crucial for healthy aging and associated with numerous health indicators and outcomes. Regular assessments of physical activity can help detect early health-related changes and manage physical activity targeted interventions. The quantification of physical activity, however, is difficult as commonly used self-reported measures are biased and rather unprecise point in time measurements. Modern alternatives are commonly based on wearable technologies which are accurate but suffer from usability and compliance issues. In this study, we assessed the potential of an unobtrusive ambient-sensor based system for continuous, long-term physical activity quantification. Towards this goal, we analysed one year of longitudinal sensor- and medical-records stemming from thirteen community-dwelling old and oldest old subjects. Based on the sensor data the daily number of room-transitions as well as the raw sensor activity were calculated. We did find the number of room-transitions, and to some degree also the raw sensor activity, to capture numerous known associations of physical activity with cognitive, well-being and motor health indicators and outcomes. The results of this study indicate that such low-cost unobtrusive ambient-sensor systems can provide an adequate approximation of older adults' overall physical activity, sufficient to capture relevant associations with health indicators and outcomes.",1
410,Automated-Entry Patient-Generated Health Data for Chronic Conditions: The Evidence on Health Outcomes [Internet],"Background:
        
      
      Automated-entry consumer devices that collect and transmit patient-generated health data (PGHD) are being evaluated as potential tools to aid in the management of chronic diseases. The need exists to evaluate the evidence regarding consumer PGHD technologies, particularly for devices that have not gone through Food and Drug Administration evaluation.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To summarize the research related to automated-entry consumer health technologies that provide PGHD for the prevention or management of 11 chronic diseases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The project scope was determined through discussions with Key Informants. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (via EMBASE.com), In-Process MEDLINE and PubMed unique content (via PubMed.gov), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews or controlled trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies. We assessed risk of bias and extracted data on health outcomes, surrogate outcomes, usability, sustainability, cost-effectiveness outcomes (quantifying the tradeoffs between health effects and cost), process outcomes, and other characteristics related to PGHD technologies. For isolated effects on health outcomes, we classified the results in one of four categories: (1) likely no effect, (2) unclear, (3) possible positive effect, or (4) likely positive effect. When we categorized the data as “unclear” based solely on health outcomes, we then examined and classified surrogate outcomes for that particular clinical condition.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      We identified 114 unique studies that met inclusion criteria. The largest number of studies addressed patients with hypertension (51 studies) and obesity (43 studies). Eighty-four trials used a single PGHD device, 23 used 2 PGHD devices, and the other 7 used 3 or more PGHD devices. Pedometers, blood pressure (BP) monitors, and scales were commonly used in the same studies. Overall, we found a “possible positive effect” of PGHD interventions on health outcomes for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and asthma. For obesity, we rated the health outcomes as unclear, and the surrogate outcomes (body mass index/weight) as likely no effect. For hypertension, we rated the health outcomes as unclear, and the surrogate outcomes (systolic BP/diastolic BP) as possible positive effect. For cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities we rated the health outcomes as unclear and the surrogate outcome (time to arrhythmia detection) as likely positive effect. The findings were “unclear” regarding PGHD interventions for diabetes prevention, sleep apnea, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most studies did not report harms related to PGHD interventions; the relatively few harms reported were minor and transient, with event rates usually comparable to harms in the control groups. Few studies reported cost-effectiveness analyses, and only for PGHD interventions for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the findings were variable across different chronic conditions and devices. Patient adherence to PGHD interventions was highly variable across studies, but patient acceptance/satisfaction and usability was generally fair to good. However, device engineers independently evaluated consumer wearable and handheld BP monitors and considered the user experience to be poor, while their assessment of smartphone-based electrocardiogram monitors found the user experience to be good. Student volunteers involved in device usability testing of the Weight Watchers Online app found it well-designed and relatively easy to use.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated some PGHD technologies (e.g., pedometers, scales, BP monitors), particularly for obesity and hypertension, but health outcomes were generally underreported. We found evidence suggesting a possible positive effect of PGHD interventions on health outcomes for four chronic conditions. Lack of reporting of health outcomes and insufficient statistical power to assess these outcomes were the main reasons for “unclear” ratings. The majority of studies on PGHD technologies still focus on non-health-related outcomes. Future RCTs should focus on measurement of health outcomes. Furthermore,future RCTs should be designed to isolate the effect of the PGHD intervention from other components in a multicomponent intervention.",6
411,Smart Glasses in Nursing Training - Redundant Gadget or Precious Tool? A Pilot Study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Heavy workloads in nursing care and high employee turnover call for efficient methods to support on-the-job training. Within the Witra Care project - aiming to develop mobile technologies to support knowledge transfer between experienced and inexperienced nurses - the objective was to investigate the feasibility and perceived usefulness of advanced smart glasses for an exemplary, specific activity in nursing training - preparation of a surgical instrument table in an operating room.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four trainee nurses performed different tasks using speech-command operated smart glasses within an operating room setting and were asked for their expectations towards this technology, their experiences and perceptions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All tasks could be achieved by the trainee nurses, and the overall perception was that the technology is supportive and helpful.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our results indicate interest in new wearable technologies for supporting training in nursing care. Limitations include small sample size, selection bias and several technical issues such as speech recognition accuracy or short battery lifetime. More research is necessary to evaluate the usefulness and usability of advanced wearable devices for supporting knowledge transfer and training in nursing care.",4
412,Introduction of a sEMG Sensor System for Autonomous Use by Inexperienced Users,"Wearable devices play an increasing role in the rehabilitation of patients with movement disorders. Although information about muscular activation is highly interesting, no approach exists that allows reliable collection of this information when the sensor is applied autonomously by the patient. This paper aims to demonstrate the proof-of-principle of an innovative sEMG sensor system, which can be used intuitively by patients while detecting their muscular activation with sufficient accuracy. The sEMG sensor system utilizes a multichannel approach based on 16 sEMG leads arranged circularly around the limb. Its design enables a stable contact between the skin surface and the system's dry electrodes, fulfills the SENIAM recommendations regarding the electrode size and inter-electrode distance and facilitates a high temporal resolution. The proof-of-principle was demonstrated by elbow flexion/extension movements of 10 subjects, proving that it has root mean square values and a signal-to-noise ratio comparable to commercial systems based on pre-gelled electrodes. Furthermore, it can be easily placed and removed by patients with reduced arm function and without detailed knowledge about the exact positioning of the sEMG electrodes. With its features, the demonstration of the sEMG sensor system's proof-of-principle positions it as a wearable device that has the potential to monitor muscular activation in home and community settings.",0

414,Collaborative Filler Network for Enhancing the Performance of BaTiO3/PDMS Flexible Piezoelectric Polymer Composite Nanogenerators,"Wearable sensors are gaining attention in human health monitoring applications, even if their usability is limited due to battery need. Flexible nanogenerators (NGs) converting biomechanical energy into electrical energy offer an interesting solution, as they can supply the sensors or extend the battery lifetime. Herein, flexible generators based on lead-free barium titanate (BaTiO3) and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer have been developed. A comparative study was performed to investigate the impact of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via structural, morphological, electrical, and electromechanical measurements. This study demonstrated that MWCNTs boosts the performance of the NG at the percolation threshold. This enhancement is attributed to the enhanced conductivity that promotes charge transfer and enhanced mechanical property and piezoceramics particles distribution. The nanogenerator delivers a maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC) up to 1.5 V and output power of 40 nW, which is two times higher than NG without MWCNTs. Additionally, the performance can be tuned by controlling the composite thickness and the applied frequency. Thicker NG shows a better performance, which enlarges their potential use for harvesting biomechanical energy efficiently up to 11.22 V under palm striking. The voltage output dependency on temperature was also investigated. The results show that the output voltage changes enormously with the temperature.",0
415,A novel online BCI system using speech imagery and ear-EEG for home appliances control,"Background and objective:
        
      
      This paper investigates a novel way to interact with home appliances via a brain-computer interface (BCI), using electroencephalograph (EEG) signals acquired from around the user's ears with a custom-made wearable BCI headphone.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The users engage in speech imagery (SI), a type of mental task where they imagine speaking out a specific word without producing any sound, to control an interactive simulated home appliance. In this work, multiple models are employed to improve the performance of the system. Temporally-stacked multi-band covariance matrix (TSMBC) method is used to represent the neural activities during SI tasks with spatial, temporal, and spectral information included. To further increase the usability of our proposed system in daily life, a calibration session, where the pre-trained models are fine-tuned, is added to maintain performance over time with minimal training. Eleven participants were recruited to evaluate our method over three different sessions: a training session, a calibration session, and an online session where users were given the freedom to achieve a given goal on their own.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the offline experiment, all participants were able to achieve a classification accuracy significantly higher than the chance level. In the online experiments, a few participants were able to use the proposed system to freely control the home appliance with high accuracy and relatively fast command delivery speed. The best participant achieved an average true positive rate and command delivery time of 0.85 and 3.79 s/command, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Based on the positive experimental results and user surveys, the novel ear-EEG-SI-based BCI paradigm is a promising approach for the wearable BCI system for daily life.",3
416,Using the Technology: Introducing Point of View Video Glasses Into the Simulated Clinical Learning Environment,"The introduction of learning technologies into educational settings continues to grow alongside the emergence of innovative technologies into the healthcare arena. The challenge for health professionals such as medical, nursing, and allied health practitioners is to develop an improved understanding of these technologies and how they may influence practice and contribute to healthcare. For nurse educators to remain contemporary, there is a need to not only embrace current technologies in teaching and learning but to also ensure that students are able to adapt to this changing pedagogy. One recent technological innovation is the use of wearable computing technology, consisting of video recording with the capability of playback analysis. The authors of this article discuss the introduction of the use of wearable Point of View video glasses by a cohort of nursing students in a simulated clinical learning laboratory. Of particular interest was the ease of use of the glasses, also termed the usability of this technology, which is central to its success. Students' reflections were analyzed together with suggestions for future use.",2
417,"Hydrogen peroxide plasma sterilization of a waterproof, high-definition video camera case for intraoperative imaging in veterinary surgery","Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the safety and usability of a wearable, waterproof high-definition camera/case for acquisition of surgical images by sterile personnel.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      An in vitro study to test the efficacy of biodecontamination of camera cases. Usability for intraoperative image acquisition was assessed in clinical procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two waterproof GoPro Hero4 Silver camera cases were inoculated by immersion in media containing Staphylococcus pseudointermedius or Escherichia coli at ≥5.50E+07 colony forming units/mL. Cases were biodecontaminated by manual washing and hydrogen peroxide plasma sterilization. Cultures were obtained by swab and by immersion in enrichment broth before and after each contamination/decontamination cycle (n = 4). The cameras were then applied by a surgeon in clinical procedures by using either a headband or handheld mode and were assessed for usability according to 5 user characteristics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Cultures of all poststerilization swabs were negative. One of 8 cultures was positive in enrichment broth, consistent with a low level of contamination in 1 sample. Usability of the camera was considered poor in headband mode, with limited battery life, inability to control camera functions, and lack of zoom function affecting image quality. Handheld operation of the camera by the primary surgeon improved usability, allowing close-up still and video intraoperative image acquisition.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization of this camera case was considered effective for biodecontamination. Handheld operation improved usability for intraoperative image acquisition.
    


          Clinical significance:
        
      
      Vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization and thorough manual washing of a waterproof camera may provide cost effective intraoperative image acquisition for documentation purposes.",4
418,A Digital Therapeutic Intervention Delivering Biofeedback for Panic Attacks (PanicMechanic): Feasibility and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Panic attacks (PAs) are an impairing mental health problem that affects >11% of adults every year. PAs are episodic, and it is difficult to predict when or where they may occur; thus, they are challenging to study and treat.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to present PanicMechanic, a novel mobile health app that captures heart rate-based data and delivers biofeedback during PAs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In our first analysis, we leveraged this tool to capture profiles of real-world PAs in the largest sample to date (148 attacks from 50 users). In our second analysis, we present the results from a pilot study to assess the usefulness of PanicMechanic as a PA intervention (N=18).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results demonstrate that heart rate fluctuates by about 15 beats per minute during a PA and takes approximately 30 seconds to return to baseline from peak, cycling approximately 4 times during each attack despite the consistently decreasing anxiety ratings. Thoughts about health were the most common trigger and potential lifestyle contributors include slightly worse stress, sleep, and eating habits and slightly less exercise and drug or alcohol consumption than typical.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The pilot study revealed that PanicMechanic is largely feasible to use but would be made more so with modifications to the app and the integration of consumer wearables. Similarly, participants found PanicMechanic useful, with 94% (15/16) indicating that they would recommend PanicMechanic to others who have PAs. These results highlight the need for future development and a controlled trial to establish the effectiveness of this digital therapeutic for preventing PAs.",3
419,β-Cyclodextrin-Based Poly (Vinyl Alcohol) Fibers for Sustained Release of Fragrances,"Poly (vinyl alcohol)/β-cyclodextrin (PVA/CD) composite fibers are prepared by wet spinning followed by hot stretching. XRD results show that β-CDs are in an amorphous state in fiber, and β-CD can help maintain the fibrous crystal that exists in the composite fiber. The DSC results show that the total crystalline ratio of the composite fibers decreased with the increase of β-CD. The as-prepared composite fibers were further crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA) to improve their usability. The crosslinked structure, together with amorphous β-CD, contributes to the loading and sustained release of fragrance molecules that were studied. The fragrance retention ratio of PVA/CD/GA is 55.63% and 48.25% for cis-jasmone and citronella, even after 25 days. The inclusion complexes of β-CD and fragrance molecules are confirmed by 2D-FTIR, which is responsible for the sustained release of fragrance. This study may contribute to the mass production of wearable long-term scented fabrics.",0
420,Secure publish-subscribe protocols for heterogeneous medical wireless body area networks,"Security and privacy issues in medical wireless body area networks (WBANs) constitute a major unsolved concern because of the challenges posed by the scarcity of resources in WBAN devices and the usability restrictions imposed by the healthcare domain. In this paper, we describe a WBAN architecture based on the well-known publish-subscribe paradigm. We present two protocols for publishing data and sending commands to a sensor that guarantee confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Both protocols are based on a recently proposed ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme that is lightweight enough to be embedded into wearable sensors. We show how sensors can implement lattice-based access control (LBAC) policies using this scheme, which are highly appropriate for the eHealth domain. We report experimental results with a prototype implementation demonstrating the suitability of our proposed solution.",0
421,Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH): Protocol for a Prospective Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by exacerbations. They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health.

422,Electronic bracelet and vision-enabled waist-belt for mobility of visually impaired people,"A wearable assistive system is proposed to improve mobility of visually impaired people (subjects). This system has been implemented in the shape of a bracelet and waist-belt in order to increase its wearable convenience and cosmetic acceptability. A camera and an ultrasonic sensor are attached to a customized waist-belt and bracelet, respectively. The proposed modular system will act as a complementary aid along with a white cane. Its vision-enabled waist-belt module detects the path and distribution of obstacles on the path. This module conveys the required information to a subject via a mono earphone by activating relevant spoken messages. The electronic bracelet module assists the subject to verify this information and to perceive distance of obstacles along with their locations. The proposed complementary system provides an improved understanding of the surrounding environment with less cognitive and perceptual efforts as compared to a white cane alone. This system was subjected to clinical evaluations with 15 totally blind subjects. Results of usability experiments demonstrated effectiveness of the system as a mobility aid. Amongst the participated subjects, 93.33% expressed satisfaction with the information content of this system, 86.66% subjects comprehended its operational convenience, and 80% appreciated the comfort of the system.",2
423,Clinicians and Older Adults' Perceptions of the Utility of Patient-Generated Health Data in Caring for Older Adults: Exploratory Mixed Methods Study,"Background:
        
      
      Many people are motivated to self-track their health and optimize their well-being through mobile health apps and wearable devices. The diversity and complexity of these systems have evolved over time, resulting in a large amount of data referred to as patient-generated health data (PGHD), which has recently emerged as a useful set of data elements in health care systems around the world. Despite the increased interest in PGHD, clinicians and older adults' perceptions of PGHD are poorly understood. In particular, although some clinician barriers to using PGHD have been identified, such as concerns about data quality, ease of use, reliability, privacy, and regulatory issues, little is known from the perspectives of older adults.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to explore the similarities and differences in the perceptions of older adults and clinicians with regard to how various types of PGHD can be used to care for older adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A mixed methods study was conducted to explore clinicians and older adults' perceptions of PGHD. Focus groups were conducted with older adults and health care providers from the Greater Toronto area and the Kitchener-Waterloo region. The participants were asked to discuss their perceptions of PGHD, including facilitators and barriers. A questionnaire aimed at exploring the perceived usefulness of a range of different PGHD was also embedded in the study design. Focus group interviews were transcribed for thematic analysis, whereas the questionnaire results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 9 participants, 4 (44%) were clinicians (average age 38.3 years, SD 7 years), and 5 (56%) were older adults (average age 81.0 years, SD 9.1 years). Four main themes were identified from the focus group interviews: influence of PGHD on patient-provider trust, reliability of PGHD, meaningful use of PGHD and PGHD-based decision support systems, and perceived clinical benefits and intrusiveness of PGHD. The questionnaire results were significantly correlated with the frequency of PGHD mentioned in the focus group interviews (r=0.42; P=.03) and demonstrated that older adults and clinicians perceived blood glucose, step count, physical activity, sleep, blood pressure, and stress level as the most useful data for managing health and delivering high-quality care.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This embedded mixed methods study generated several important findings about older adults and clinicians' perceptions and perceived usefulness of a range of PGHD. Owing to the exploratory nature of this study, further research is needed to understand the concerns about data privacy, potential negative impact on the trust between older adults and clinicians, data quality and quantity, and usability of PGHD-related technologies for older adults.",2
424,Patient-Generated Health Data Integration and Advanced Analytics for Diabetes Management: The AID-GM Platform,"Diabetes is a high-prevalence disease that leads to an alteration in the patient's blood glucose (BG) values. Several factors influence the subject's BG profile over the day, including meals, physical activity, and sleep. Wearable devices are available for monitoring the patient's BG value around the clock, while activity trackers can be used to record his/her sleep and physical activity. However, few tools are available to jointly analyze the collected data, and only a minority of them provide functionalities for performing advanced and personalized analyses. In this paper, we present AID-GM, a web application that enables the patient to share with his/her diabetologist both the raw BG data collected by a flash glucose monitoring device, and the information collected by activity trackers, including physical activity, heart rate, and sleep. AID-GM provides several data views for summarizing the subject's metabolic control over time, and for complementing the BG profile with the information given by the activity tracker. AID-GM also allows the identification of complex temporal patterns in the collected heterogeneous data. In this paper, we also present the results of a real-world pilot study aimed to assess the usability of the proposed system. The study involved 30 pediatric patients receiving care at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, Italy.",1
425,Monitoring fetal heart rate during pregnancy: contributions from advanced signal processing and wearable technology,"Monitoring procedures are the basis to evaluate the clinical state of patients and to assess changes in their conditions, thus providing necessary interventions in time. Both these two objectives can be achieved by integrating technological development with methodological tools, thus allowing accurate classification and extraction of useful diagnostic information. The paper is focused on monitoring procedures applied to fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) signals, collected during pregnancy, in order to assess fetal well-being. The use of linear time and frequency techniques as well as the computation of non linear indices can contribute to enhancing the diagnostic power and reliability of fetal monitoring. The paper shows how advanced signal processing approaches can contribute to developing new diagnostic and classification indices. Their usefulness is evaluated by comparing two selected populations: normal fetuses and intra uterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses. Results show that the computation of different indices on FHRV signals, either linear and nonlinear, gives helpful indications to describe pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular and neural system controlling the fetal heart. As a further contribution, the paper briefly describes how the introduction of wearable systems for fetal ECG recording could provide new technological solutions improving the quality and usability of prenatal monitoring.",0
426,Pilot Test of a New Personal Health System Integrating Environmental and Wearable Sensors for Telemonitoring and Care of Elderly People at Home (SMARTA Project),"Background:
        
      
      The increase in life expectancy is accompanied by a growing number of elderly subjects affected by chronic comorbidities, a health issue which also implies important socioeconomic consequences. Shifting from hospital or community dwelling care towards a home personalized healthcare paradigm would promote active aging with a better quality of life, along with a reduction in healthcare-related costs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of the SMARTA project was to develop and test an innovative personal health system integrating standard sensors as well as innovative wearable and environmental sensors to allow home telemonitoring of vital parameters and detection of anomalies in daily activities, thus supporting active aging through remote healthcare.

      A first phase of the project consisted in the definition of the health and environmental parameters to be monitored (electrocardiography and actigraphy, blood pressure and oxygen saturation, weight, ear temperature, glycemia, home interaction monitoring - water tap, refrigerator, and dishwasher), the feedbacks for the clinicians, and the reminders for the patients. It was followed by a technical feasibility analysis leading to an iterative process of prototype development, sensor integration, and testing. Once the prototype had reached an advanced stage of development, a group of 32 volunteers - including 15 healthy adult subjects, 13 elderly people with cardiac diseases, and 4 clinical operators - was recruited to test the system in a real home setting, in order to evaluate both technical reliability and user perception of the system in terms of effectiveness, usability, acceptance, and attractiveness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The testing in a real home setting showed a good perception of the SMARTA system and its functionalities both by the patients and by the clinicians, who appreciated the user interface and the clinical governance system. The moderate system reliability of 65-70% evidenced some technical issues, mainly related to sensor integration, while the patient's user interface showed excellent reliability (100%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both elderly people and clinical operators considered the SMARTA system a promising and attractive tool for improving patients' healthcare while reducing related costs and preserving quality of life. However, the moderate reliability of the system should prompt further technical developments in terms of sensor integration and usability of the clinical operator's user interface.",0
427,Evaluation of Digital Interventions for Physical Activity Promotion: Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      Digital interventions are interventions supported by digital tools or technologies, such as mobile apps, wearables, or web-based software. Digital interventions in the context of public health are specifically designed to promote and improve health. Recent reviews have shown that many digital interventions target physical activity promotion; however, it is unclear how such digital interventions are evaluated.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to investigate evaluation strategies in the context of digital interventions for physical activity promotion using a scoping review of published reviews. We focused on the target (ie, user outcomes or tool performance), methods (ie, tool data or self-reported data), and theoretical frameworks of the evaluation strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A protocol for this study was preregistered and published. From among 300 reviews published up to March 19, 2021 in Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, 40 reviews (1 rapid, 9 scoping, and 30 systematic) were included in this scoping review. Two authors independently performed study selection and data coding. Consensus was reached by discussion. If applicable, data were coded quantitatively into predefined categories or qualitatively using definitions or author statements from the included reviews. Data were analyzed using either descriptive statistics, for quantitative data (relative frequencies out of all studies), or narrative synthesis focusing on common themes, for qualitative data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most reviews that were included in our scoping review were published in the period from 2019 to 2021 and originated from Europe or Australia. Most primary studies cited in the reviews included adult populations in clinical or nonclinical settings, and focused on mobile apps or wearables for physical activity promotion. The evaluation target was a user outcome (efficacy, acceptability, usability, feasibility, or engagement) in 38 of the 40 reviews or tool performance in 24 of the 40 reviews. Evaluation methods relied upon objective tool data (in 35/40 reviews) or other data from self-reports or assessments (in 28/40 reviews). Evaluation frameworks based on behavior change theory, including goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback on behavior, and educational or motivational content, were mentioned in 22 out of 40 reviews. Behavior change theory was included in the development phases of digital interventions according to the findings of 20 out of 22 reviews.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The evaluation of digital interventions is a high priority according to the reviews included in this scoping review. Evaluations of digital interventions, including mobile apps or wearables for physical activity promotion, typically target user outcomes and rely upon objective tool data. Behavior change theory may provide useful guidance not only for development of digital interventions but also for the evaluation of user outcomes in the context of physical activity promotion. Future research should investigate factors that could improve the efficacy of digital interventions and the standardization of terminology and reporting in this field.

428,Software Packages and Tools for the Analysis of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data,"The advancement of technology in the field of glycemic control has led to the widespread use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which can be nowadays obtained from wearable devices equipped with a minimally invasive sensor, that is, transcutaneous needle type or implantable, and a transmitter that sends information to a receiver or smart device for data storage and display. This work aims to review the currently available software packages and tools for the analysis of CGM data. Based on the purposes of this work, 12 software packages have been identified from the literature, published until December 2021, namely: GlyCulator, EasyGV (Easy Glycemic Variability), CGM-GUIDE© (Continuous Glucose Monitoring Graphical User Interface for Diabetes Evaluation), GVAP (Glycemic Variability Analyzer Program), Tidepool, CGManalyzer, cgmanalysis, GLU, CGMStatsAnalyser, iglu, rGV, and cgmquantify. Comparison of available software packages and tools has been done in terms of main characteristics (i.e., publication year, presence of a graphical user interface, availability, open-source code, number of citations, programming language, supported devices, supported data format and organization of the data structure, documentation, presence of a toy example, video tutorial, data upload and download, measurement-units conversion), preprocessing procedures, data display options, and computed metrics; also, each of the computed metrics has been analyzed in terms of its adherence to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2017 international consensus on CGM data analysis and the ADA 2019 international consensus on time in range. Eventually, the agreement between metrics computed by different software and tools has been investigated. Based on such comparison, usability and complexity of data management, as well as the possibility to perform customized or patients-group analyses, have been discussed by highlighting limitations and strengths, also in relation to possible different user categories (i.e., patients, clinicians, researchers). The information provided could be useful to researchers interested in working in the diabetic research field as to clinicians and endocrinologists who need tools capable of handling CGM data effectively.",0
429,The Educational and Supportive Mobile Application for Caregivers of Dementia People,"This paper presents a healthcare mobile app for caregivers of dementia patients. The app had been implemented to run on wearable and mobile devices, and it helps caregivers to take dementia test, review dementia test history, and search location of public health centers in the vicinity. The collective purpose of these features is to provide meaningful healthcare services to elderly at risk of dementia. The app uses the time and change (T&amp;C) test for screening for dementia. The app was tried for its validity and usability for the intended purpose, and participating users were surveyed to evaluate its usefulness.",4
430,Human Factors Associated with Continuous Glucose Monitor Use in Patients with Diabetes: A Systematic Review,"Consistent continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use is associated with substantial improvements in glycemic control, yet the uptake and continued use of these technologies remains low. This systematic review aims to identify and summarize the state of science on human factors and their association with CGM use to inform training methods and best practices that support adherence to CGM use and automated insulin delivery systems. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, and PsychInfo databases using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to identify studies that reported psychological human factors related to CGM or sensor-augmented pump use in patients with type 1 diabetes. In total, 389 records were identified through our database search and 26 studies published between 2010 and 2017 were included. Articles underwent quality appraisal using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and were categorized according to study outcomes. Identified human factors with a potential association with CGM use were treatment satisfaction, quality of life, emotional distress, and self-efficacy. Eight patient-reported barriers to CGM use were identified as a subcomponent of satisfaction. To date, studies of human factors associated with CGM use generally lack standardized measures and sufficient methodological rigor necessary to establish causation. A more robust understanding of how identified human factors influence CGM use is necessary. Future studies should test interventions that target human factors to improve consistency of use and establish best practices for enhancing patients' experience and acceptance of these technologies, especially within adolescents and young adults.",4
431,Integrating hand exoskeletons into goal-oriented clinic and home stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic exoskeletons are emerging as rehabilitation and assistive technologies that simultaneously restore function and enable independence for people with disabilities.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      We investigated the feasibility and orthotic and restorative effects of an exoskeleton-supported goal-directed rehabilitation program for people with hand impairments after stroke or Spinal Cord Injury (SCI).
    


          Method:
        
      
      A single-arm case-series feasibility study was conducted using a wearable untethered hand exoskeleton during goal-directed therapy programs with in-clinic and at-home components. Therapists trained stroke and SCI patients to use a hand exoskeleton during rehabilitation exercises, activities of daily living and patient-selected goals. Each patient received a 1-hour in-clinic training session on five consecutive days, then took the exoskeleton home for two consecutive days to perform therapist-recommended tasks. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) and the Box and Block Test (BBT) were administered at baseline, after in-clinic therapy and after home use, with and again without wearing the exoskeleton. The System Usability Scale (SUS), Motor Activity Log, and Fugl-Meyer Assessment were also administered to assess the intervention's acceptability, adherence, usability and effectiveness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four stroke patients (Chedoke McMaster Stage of Hand 2-4) and one SCI patient (ASIA C8 Motor Stage 1) 23 ± 19 months post-injury wore the hand exoskeleton to perform 280 ± 23 exercise repetitions in the clinic and additional goal-oriented tasks at home. The patients performed their own goals and the dexterity task with higher performance following the 7-days therapy program in comparison to baseline for both exoskeleton-assisted (ΔGAS: 18 ± 10, ΔBBT: 1 ± 5) and unassisted (ΔGAS: 14 ± 14, ΔBBT: 3 ± 4) assessments. Therapists and patients provided 'good' SUS ratings of 78 ± 6 and no harmful events were reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The exoskeleton-supported stroke and SCI therapy program with in-clinic and at-home training components was feasible.",3
432,Novel Technologies Found to be Valid and Reliable for the Measurement of Vertical Jump Height With Jump-and-Reach Testing,"Brooks, ER, Benson, AC, and Bruce, LM. Novel technologies found to be valid and reliable for the measurement of vertical jump height with jump-and-reach testing. J Strength Cond Res 32(10): 2838-2845, 2018-Vertical jump testing is used by coaches and athletes across many sports and disciplines to assess lower-body power and neuromuscular fatigue. A range of devices are available to measure jump height, with recent innovations attempting to improve portability, usability, and accessibility. New devices should be evaluated for their effectiveness and dependability in specific tests before being adopted. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of 2 novel measurement devices for jump height testing with a jump-and-reach protocol. Twenty-six healthy, active adults participated during 2 testing occasions. A wearable inertial measurement unit (VERT) and a smart device application (My Jump 2) were compared with established measures (force platform and jump-and-reach apparatus [Yardstick]). Correlations between the VERT and force platform were r = 0.95 (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-0.97), and r = 0.93 (90% CI: 0.90-0.95) for the Yardstick. Correlations between the My Jump 2 app and force platform were r = 0.98 (90% CI: 0.97-0.99), and r = 0.94 (90% CI: 0.92-0.96) for the Yardstick. Reliability, measured as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), was 0.91 (90% CI: 0.87-0.94) for the VERT, and 0.97 (90% CI: 0.96-0.98) for the My Jump 2 app. Intrarater reliability for the My Jump 2 app was ICC = 0.99 (90% CI: 0.99-0.99). The VERT and the My Jump 2 app have both shown acceptable validity and reliability compared with both the force platform and Yardstick. However, practitioners should consider which measurement device/s to use based on the acceptable level of potential error for their population and testing objectives.",1
433,Development of a Non-Contacting Muscular Activity Measurement System for Evaluating Knee Extensors Training in Real-Time,"To give people more specific information on the quality of their daily motion, it is necessary to continuously measure muscular activity during everyday occupations in an easy way. The traditional methods to measure muscle activity using a combination of surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors and optical motion capture system are expensive and not suitable for non-technical users and unstructured environment. For this reason, in our group we are researching methods to estimate leg muscle activity using non-contact wearable sensors, improving ease of movement and system usability. In a previous study, we developed a method to estimate muscle activity via only a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the shank. In this study, we describe a method to estimate muscle activity during walking via two IMU sensors, using an original sensing system and specifically developed estimation algorithms based on ANN techniques. The muscle activity estimation results, estimated by the proposed algorithm after optimization, showed a relatively high estimation accuracy with a correlation efficient of R2 = 0.48 and a standard deviation STD = 0.10, with a total system average delay of 192 ms. As the average interval between different gait phases in human gait is 250-1000 ms, a 192 ms delay is still acceptable for daily walking requirements. For this reason, compared with the previous study, the newly proposed system presents a higher accuracy and is better suitable for real-time leg muscle activity estimation during walking.",7
434,"Evaluation of non-invasive continuous physiological monitoring devices for neonates in Nairobi, Kenya: a research protocol","Introduction:
        
      
      Continuous physiological monitoring devices are often not available for monitoring high-risk neonates in low-resource settings. Easy-to-use, non-invasive, multiparameter, continuous physiological monitoring devices could be instrumental in providing appropriate care and improving outcomes for high-risk neonates in these low-resource settings.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      The purpose of this prospective, observational, facility-based evaluation is to provide evidence to establish whether two existing non-invasive, multiparameter, continuous physiological monitoring devices developed by device developers, EarlySense and Sibel, can accurately and reliably measure vital signs in neonates (when compared with verified reference devices). We will also assess the feasibility, usability and acceptability of these devices for use in neonates in low-resource settings in Africa. Up to 500 neonates are enrolled in two phases: (1) a verification and accuracy evaluation phase at Aga Khan University-Nairobi and (2) a clinical feasibility evaluation phase at Pumwani Maternity Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected and analysed. Agreement between the investigational and reference devices is determined using a priori-defined accuracy thresholds.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      This trial was approved by the Aga Khan University Nairobi Research Ethics Committee and the Western Institutional Review Board. We plan to disseminate research results in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.

435,Body-Worn Sensors for Parkinson's disease: A qualitative approach with patients and healthcare professionals,"Body-Worn Sensors (BWS) provide reliable objective and continuous assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms, but their implementation in clinical routine has not yet become widespread. Users' perceptions of BWS have not been explored. This study intended to evaluate the usability, user experience (UX), patients' perceptions of BWS, and health professionals' (HP) opinions on BWS monitoring. A qualitative analysis was performed from semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 patients and 9 HP experts in PD. Patients completed two interviews before and after the BWS one-week experiment, and they answered two questionnaires assessing the usability and UX. Patients rated the three BWS usability with high scores (SUS median [range]: 87.5 [72.5-100]). The UX across all dimensions of their interaction with the BWS was positive. During interviews, all patients and HP expressed interest in BWS monitoring. Patients' hopes and expectations increased the more they learned about BWS. They manifested enthusiasm to wear BWS, which they imagined could improve their PD symptoms. HP highlighted needs for logistical support in the implementation of BWS in their practice. Both patients and HP suggested possible uses of BWS monitoring in clinical practice, for treatment adjustments for example, or for research purposes. Patients and HP shared ideas about the use of BWS monitoring, although patients may be more likely to integrate BWS into their disease follow-up compared to HP in their practice. This study highlights gaps that need to be fulfilled to facilitate BWS adoption and promote their potential.",2
436,Toward an Ultralow-Power Onboard Processor for Tongue Drive System,"The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a new unobtrusive, wireless, and wearable assistive device that allows for real-time tracking of the voluntary tongue motion in the oral space for communication, control, and navigation applications. The latest TDS prototype appears as a wireless headphone and has been tested in human subject trials. However, the robustness of the external TDS (eTDS) in real-life outdoor conditions may not meet safety regulations because of the limited mechanical stability of the headset. The intraoral TDS (iTDS), which is in the shape of a dental retainer, firmly clasps to the upper teeth and resists sensor misplacement. However, the iTDS has more restrictions on its dimensions, limiting the battery size and consequently requiring a considerable reduction in its power consumption to operate over an extended period of two days on a single charge. In this brief, we propose an ultralow-power local processor for the TDS that performs all signal processing on the transmitter side, following the sensors. Assuming the TDS user on average issuing one command/s, implementing the computational engine reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted to a PC or smartphone by a factor of 1500×, from 12 kb/s to ~8 b/s. The proposed design is implemented on an ultralow-power IGLOO nano field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and is tested on AGLN250 prototype board. According to our post-place-and-route results, implementing the engine on the FPGA significantly drops the required data transmission, while an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation in a 65-nm CMOS results in a 15× power saving compared to the FPGA solution and occupies a 0.02-mm2 footprint. As a result, the power consumption and size of the iTDS will be significantly reduced through the use of a much smaller rechargeable battery. Moreover, the system can operate longer following every recharge, improving the iTDS usability.",3
437,Exoscore: A Design Tool to Evaluate Factors Associated With Technology Acceptance of Soft Lower Limb Exosuits by Older Adults,"Objective:
        
      
      This pilot study proposed and performs initial testing with Exoscore, a design evaluation tool to assess factors related to acceptance of exoskeleton by older adults, during the technology development and testing phases.
    


          Background:
        
      
      As longevity increases and our aging population continues to grow, assistive technologies such as exosuits and exoskeletons can provide enhanced quality of life and independence. Exoscore is a design and prototype stage evaluation method to assess factors related to perceptions of the technology, the aim being to optimize technology acceptance.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In this pilot study, we applied the three-phase Exoscore tool during testing with 11 older adults. The aims were to explore the feasibility and face validity of applying the design evaluation tool during user testing of a prototype soft lower limb exoskeleton.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Exoscore method is presented as part of an iterative design evaluation process. The method was applied during an exoskeleton research and development project. The data revealed the aspects of the concept design that rated favorably with the users and the aspects of the design that required more attention to improve their potential acceptance when deployed as finished products.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Exoscore was effectively applied to three phases of evaluation during a testing session of a soft exoskeleton. Future exoskeleton development can benefit from the application of this design evaluation tool.
    


          Application:

438,An Interactive Web Portal for Tracking Oncology Patient Physical Activity and Symptoms: Prospective Cohort Study,"Background:
        
      
      Physical activity levels typically decline during cancer treatment and often do not return to prediagnosis or minimum recommended levels. Interventions to promote physical activity are needed. Support through the use of digital health tools may be helpful in this situation.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The goal of the research was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of an interactive Web portal developed to support patients with cancer to increase daily physical activity levels.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Web portal for supportive cancer care which was developed to act as a patient-clinician information and coaching tool focused on integrating wearable device data and remote symptom reporting. Patients currently receiving or who had completed intensive anticancer therapy were recruited to 3 cohorts. All cohorts were given access to the Web portal and an activity monitor over a 10-week period. Cohort 2 received additional summative messaging, and cohort 3 received personalized coaching messaging. Qualitative semistructured interviews were completed following the intervention. The primary outcome was feasibility of the use of the portal assessed as both the number of log-ins to the portal to record symptoms and the completion of post-program questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 49 people were recruited, 40 completed the intervention. Engagement increased with more health professional contact and was highest in cohort 3. The intervention was found to be acceptable by participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The portal was feasible for use by people with a history of cancer. Further research is needed to determine optimal coaching methods.",6
439,A knitted garment using intarsia technique for Heart Rate Variability biofeedback: Evaluation of initial prototype,"Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is a method based on paced breathing at specific rate called resonance frequency by giving online feedbacks from user respiration and its effect on HRV. Since the HRV is also influence by different factors like stress and emotions, stress related to an unfamiliar measurement device, cables and skin electrodes may cover the underling effect of such kind of intervention. Wearable systems are usually considered as intuitive solutions which are more familiar to the end-user and can help to improve usability and hence reducing the stress. In this work, a prototype of a knitted garment using intarsia technique is developed and evaluated. Results show the satisfactory level of quality for Electrocardiogram and thoracic electrical bioimpedance i.e. for respiration monitoring as a part of HRV biofeedback system. Using intarsia technique and conductive yarn for making the connection instead of cables will reduce the complexity of fabrication in textile production and hence reduce the final costs in a final commercial product. Further development of garment and Android application is ongoing and usability and efficiency of final prototype will be evaluated in detail.",0
440,Usability and Accuracy of a Smartwatch for the Assessment of Physical Activity in the Elderly Population: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Regular physical activity (PA) contributes to the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic diseases and reduces the risk of premature death. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a variety of chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint diseases (eg, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis), depression, and colon and breast cancer. Population aging and the related increase in chronic diseases have a major impact on the health care systems of most Western countries and will produce an even more significant effect in the future. Monitoring PA is a valuable method of determining whether people are performing enough PA so as to prevent chronic diseases or are showing early symptoms of those diseases.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants aged 70 to 90 years with the ability to walk safely without any walking aid for at least 300 meters, who had no walking disabilities or episodes of falling while walking in the last 12 months, were asked to walk 150 meters at their preferred pace wearing a vívoactive HR device (Garmin Ltd) and actual steps were monitored and tallied by a researcher using a hand-tally counter to assess the performance of the device at a natural speed. A Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the difference between manually counted steps and wearable device-measured steps. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed (with a 95% confidence interval) between step measurements. The generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) ICCs were estimated, providing a random effect term (random intercept) for the individual measurements (gold standard and device). Both adjusted and conditional ICCs were computed for the GLMM models considering separately the effect of age, sex, BMI, and obesity. Analyses were performed using R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the rms package.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 23 females and 26 males were enrolled in the study. The median age of the participants was 75 years. The Bland-Altman plot revealed that, excluding one observation, all differences across measurements were in the confidence bounds, demonstrating the substantial agreement between the step count measurements. The results were confirmed by an ICC equal to .98 (.96-.99), demonstrating excellent agreement between the two sets of measurements.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The level of accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting that was found in this study supports the idea of considering wrist-wearable nonmedical devices (widely available in nonspecialized stores) as reliable tools. Both health care professionals and informal caregivers could monitor the level of PA of their patients.",4
441,Usability and Reliability of Smart Glasses for Secondary Triage During Mass Casualty Incidents,"Wearable smart glasses like Google Glass provide real-time video and image transmission to remote viewers. The use of Google Glass and other Augmented Reality (AR) platforms in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) can provide incident commanders and physicians at receiving hospitals real-time data regarding injuries sustained by victims at the scene. This real-time data is critical to allocation of hospital resources prior to receiving victims of a MCI. Remote physician participation in real-time MCI care prior to victims' hospital arrival may improve triage, and direct emergency and critical care services to those most in need. We report the use of Google Glass among first responders to transmit real-time data from a simulated MCI to allow remote physicians to complete augmented secondary triage.",4
442,A Wearable Device for Breathing Frequency Monitoring: A Pilot Study on Patients with Muscular Dystrophy,"Patients at risk of developing respiratory dysfunctions, such as patients with severe forms of muscular dystrophy, need a careful respiratory assessment, and periodic follow-up visits to monitor the progression of the disease. In these patients, at-home continuous monitoring of respiratory activity patterns could provide additional understanding about disease progression, allowing prompt clinical intervention. The core aim of the present study is thus to investigate the feasibility of using an innovative wearable device for respiratory monitoring, particularly breathing frequency variation assessment, in patients with muscular dystrophy. A comparison of measurements of breathing frequency with gold standard methods showed that the device based on the inertial measurement units (IMU-based device) provided optimal results in terms of accuracy errors, correlation, and agreement. Participants positively evaluated the device for ease of use, comfort, usability, and wearability. Moreover, preliminary results confirmed that breathing frequency is a valuable breathing parameter to monitor, at the clinic and at home, because it strongly correlates with the main indexes of respiratory function.",9
443,Development and Usability Testing of an Emergency Alert Device for Elderly People and People with Disabilities,"The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an emergency alert device for elderly people and people with disabilities by usability testing. There were two phases in this study: (1) development of a prototype for an emergency alert device and (2) usability testing of the device. Results presented development of the prototype, which comprised parts for sending and receiving signals. There were two kinds of alarms for emergency calls known as conscious and unconscious alerts. Participants in the usability testing phase included 12 specialists and 161 users that comprised 146 elderly people or people with disabilities and 15 caregivers or community health volunteers.

This interface was developed to integrate patient self-monitoring data collected from a wearable fitness tracker and its companion smartphone app to an electronic health record system for diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) to facilitate behavioral goal monitoring.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 3-month multi-site pragmatic clinical trial was conducted with eligible patients with diabetes mellitus from DSMES programs. The Chronicle Diabetes system is currently freely available to diabetes educators through American Diabetes Association-recognized DSMES programs to set patient nutrition and physical activity goals. To integrate the goal-setting and self-monitoring intervention into the DSMES process, a connected interface in the Chronicle Diabetes system was developed. With the connected interface, patient self-monitoring information collected from smartphones and wearable fitness trackers can facilitate educators' monitoring of patients' adherence to their goals. Feasibility outcomes of the 3-month trial included hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and the usability of the connected system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An interface designed to connect data from a wearable fitness tracker with a companion smartphone app for nutrition and physical activity self-monitoring into a diabetes education electronic health record system was successfully developed to enable diabetes educators to facilitate goal setting and monitoring. A total of 60 eligible patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized into either group 1) standard diabetes education or 2) standard education enhanced with the connected system. Data collection for the 3-month pragmatic trial is completed. Data analysis is in progress.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      If results of the pragmatic multi-site clinical trial show preliminary efficacy and usability of the connected system, a large-scale implementation trial will be conducted.

445,Assessing the usability of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity in chronic conditions: a systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      The World Health Organisation's global strategy for digital health emphasises the importance of patient involvement. Understanding the usability and acceptability of wearable devices is a core component of this. However, usability assessments to date have focused predominantly on healthy adults. There is a need to understand the patient perspective of wearable devices in participants with chronic health conditions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted to identify any study design that included a usability assessment of wearable devices to measure mobility, through gait and physical activity, within five cohorts with chronic conditions (Parkinson's disease [PD], multiple sclerosis [MS], congestive heart failure, [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD], and proximal femoral fracture [PFF]).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-seven studies were identified. Substantial heterogeneity in the quality of reporting, the methods used to assess usability, the devices used, and the aims of the studies precluded any meaningful comparisons. Questionnaires were used in the majority of studies (70.3%; n = 26) with a reliance on intervention specific measures (n = 16; 61.5%). For those who used interviews (n = 17; 45.9%), no topic guides were provided, while methods of analysis were not reported in over a third of studies (n = 6; 35.3%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Usability of wearable devices is a poorly measured and reported variable in chronic health conditions. Although the heterogeneity in how these devices are implemented implies acceptance, the patient voice should not be assumed. In the absence of being able to make specific usability conclusions, the results of this review instead recommends that future research needs to: (1) Conduct usability assessments as standard, irrespective of the cohort under investigation or the type of study undertaken. (2) Adhere to basic reporting standards (e.g. COREQ) including the basic details of the study. Full copies of any questionnaires and interview guides should be supplied through supplemental files. (3) Utilise mixed methods research to gather a more comprehensive understanding of usability than either qualitative or quantitative research alone will provide. (4) Use previously validated questionnaires alongside any intervention specific measures.",2
446,"Development of VariLeg, an exoskeleton with variable stiffness actuation: first results and user evaluation from the CYBATHLON 2016","Background:
        
      
      Powered exoskeletons are a promising approach to restore the ability to walk after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, current exoskeletons remain limited in their walking speed and ability to support tasks of daily living, such as stair climbing or overcoming ramps. Moreover, training progress for such advanced mobility tasks is rarely reported in literature. The work presented here aims to demonstrate the basic functionality of the VariLeg exoskeleton and its ability to enable people with motor complete SCI to perform mobility tasks of daily life.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      VariLeg is a novel powered lower limb exoskeleton that enables adjustments to the compliance in the leg, with the objective of improving the robustness of walking on uneven terrain. This is achieved by an actuation system with variable mechanical stiffness in the knee joint, which was validated through test bench experiments. The feasibility and usability of the exoskeleton was tested with two paraplegic users with motor complete thoracic lesions at Th4 and Th12. The users trained three times a week, in 60 min sessions over four months with the aim of participating in the CYBATHLON 2016 competition, which served as a field test for the usability of the exoskeleton. The progress on basic walking skills and on advanced mobility tasks such as incline walking and stair climbing is reported. Within this first study, the exoskeleton was used with a constant knee stiffness.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Test bench evaluation of the variable stiffness actuation system demonstrate that the stiffness could be rendered with an error lower than 30 Nm/rad. During training with the exoskeleton, both users acquired proficient skills in basic balancing, walking and slalom walking. In advanced mobility tasks, such as climbing ramps and stairs, only basic (needing support) to intermediate (able to perform task independently in 25% of the attempts) skill levels were achieved. After 4 months of training, one user competed at the CYBATHLON 2016 and was able to perform 3 (stand-sit-stand, slalom and tilted path) out of 6 obstacles of the track. No adverse events occurred during the training or the competition.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Demonstration of the applicability to restore ambulation for people with motor complete SCI was achieved. The CYBATHLON highlighted the importance of training and gaining experience in piloting an exoskeleton, which were just as important as the technical realization of the robot.",3
447,Feasibility of using activity trackers and apps to increase physical activity in whole families: The Step it Up Family intervention,"Objective:
        
      
      This study examined the feasibility of an activity tracker and app intervention to increase physical activity in whole families.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a single-arm feasibility study with pre-post-intervention measures. Between 2017 and 2018, 40 families (58 children aged 6-10 years, 39 mothers, 33 fathers) participated in the 6-week Step it Up Family programme in Queensland, Australia. It was delivered using Garmin activity trackers and apps, weekly motivational text messages and an introductory session. Online surveys and semi-structured interviews conducted with parents assessed intervention usage, acceptability, usability, perceived usefulness, use of physical activity self-management strategies and programme influence. Analyses included descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and qualitative content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 38 families completed the post-intervention survey (95% family retention; 90% children, 95% mothers, 88% fathers). Garmin activity tracker usage was high (i.e. nearly 24/7 during the 6 weeks intervention). Families also used the Garmin apps regularly (i.e. mostly 2-6 times per week). Further, 80% of mothers and 52% of fathers read the motivational mobile text messages. Usability and perceived usefulness of the Garmin activity trackers and apps were rated high. Both parents significantly increased their use of physical activity self-management strategies from pre to post-intervention. Parents expressed that the intervention had increased awareness of physical (in)activity in the family, encouraged to be active and promoted outdoor family activities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using activity trackers and apps to increase physical activity in the whole family was well received by children and parents which suggests that this intervention approach is feasible. However, further testing is needed amongst more diverse family populations. These early findings support the implementation of a randomised controlled trial to examine intervention efficacy.",3
448,Facilitating medical information search using Google Glass connected to a content-based medical image retrieval system,"Wearable computing devices are starting to change the way users interact with computers and the Internet. Among them, Google Glass includes a small screen located in front of the right eye, a camera filming in front of the user and a small computing unit. Google Glass has the advantage to provide online services while allowing the user to perform tasks with his/her hands. These augmented glasses uncover many useful applications, also in the medical domain. For example, Google Glass can easily provide video conference between medical doctors to discuss a live case. Using these glasses can also facilitate medical information search by allowing the access of a large amount of annotated medical cases during a consultation in a non-disruptive fashion for medical staff. In this paper, we developed a Google Glass application able to take a photo and send it to a medical image retrieval system along with keywords in order to retrieve similar cases. As a preliminary assessment of the usability of the application, we tested the application under three conditions (images of the skin; printed CT scans and MRI images; and CT and MRI images acquired directly from an LCD screen) to explore whether using Google Glass affects the accuracy of the results returned by the medical image retrieval system. The preliminary results show that despite minor problems due to the relative stability of the Google Glass, images can be sent to and processed by the medical image retrieval system and similar images are returned to the user, potentially helping in the decision making process.",0
449,Usability of Wearable Devices With a Novel Cardiac Force Index for Estimating the Dynamic Cardiac Function: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Long-distance running can be a form of stress to the heart. Technological improvements combined with the public's gradual turn toward mobile health (mHealth), self-health, and exercise effectiveness have resulted in the widespread use of wearable exercise products. The monitoring of dynamic cardiac function changes during running and running performance should be further studied.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We investigated the relationship between dynamic cardiac function changes and finish time for 3000-meter runs. Using a wearable device based on a novel cardiac force index (CFI), we explored potential correlations among 3000-meter runners with stronger and weaker cardiac functions during running.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study used the American product BioHarness 3.0 (Zephyr Technology Corporation), which can measure basic physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, maximum oxygen consumption, and activity. We investigated the correlations among new physiological parameters, including CFI = weight * activity / heart rate, cardiac force ratio (CFR) = CFI of running / CFI of walking, and finish times for 3000-meter runs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results showed that waist circumference, smoking, and CFI were the significant factors for qualifying in the 3000-meter run. The prediction model was as follows: ln (3000 meters running performance pass probability / fail results probability) = -2.702 - 0.096 × [waist circumference] - 1.827 × [smoke] + 0.020 × [ACi7]. If smoking and the ACi7 were controlled, contestants with a larger waist circumference tended to fail the qualification based on the formula above. If waist circumference and ACi7 were controlled, smokers tended to fail more often than nonsmokers. Finally, we investigated a new calculation method for monitoring cardiac status during exercise that uses the CFI of walking for the runner as a reference to obtain the ratio between the cardiac force of exercise and that of walking (CFR) to provide a standard for determining if the heart is capable of exercise. A relationship is documented between the CFR and the performance of 3000-meter runs in a healthy 22-year-old person. During the running period, data are obtained while participant slowly runs 3000 meters, and the relationship between the CFR and time is plotted. The runner's CFR varies with changes in activity. Since the runner's acceleration increases, the CFR quickly increases to an explosive peak, indicating the runner's explosive power. At this period, the CFI revealed a 3-fold increase (CFR=3) in a strong heart. After a time lapse, the CFR is approximately 2.5 during an endurance period until finishing the 3000-meter run. Similar correlation is found in a runner with a weak heart, with the CFR at the beginning period being 4 and approximately 2.5 thereafter.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In conclusion, the study results suggested that measuring the real-time CFR changes could be used in a prediction model for 3000-meter running performance.",7
450,Bringing rehabilitation home with an e-health platform to treat stroke patients: study protocol of a randomized clinical trial (RGS@home),"Background:
        
      
      There is a pressing need for scalable healthcare solutions and a shift in the rehabilitation paradigm from hospitals to homes to tackle the increase in stroke incidence while reducing the practical and economic burden for patients, hospitals, and society. Digital health technologies can contribute to addressing this challenge; however, little is known about their effectiveness in at-home settings. In response, we have designed the RGS@home study to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and cost of a deep tech solution called the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS). RGS is a cloud-based system for delivering AI-enhanced rehabilitation using virtual reality, motion capture, and wearables that can be used in the hospital and at home. The core principles of the brain theory-based RGS intervention are to deliver rehabilitation exercises in the form of embodied, goal-oriented, and task-specific action.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The RGS@home study is a randomized longitudinal clinical trial designed to assess whether the combination of the RGS intervention with standard care is superior to standard care alone for the functional recovery of stroke patients at the hospital and at home. The study is conducted in collaboration with hospitals in Spain, Sweden, and France and includes inpatients and outpatients at subacute and chronic stages post-stroke. The intervention duration is 3 months with assessment at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The impact of RGS is evaluated in terms of quality of life measurements, usability, and acceptance using standardized clinical scales, together with health economic analysis. So far, one-third of the patients expected to participate in the study have been recruited (N = 90, mean age 60, days after stroke ≥ 30 days). The trial will end in July 2023.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      We predict an improvement in the patients' recovery, high acceptance, and reduced costs due to a soft landing from the clinic to home rehabilitation. In addition, the data provided will allow us to assess whether the prescription of therapy at home can counteract deterioration and improve quality of life while also identifying new standards for online and remote assessment, diagnostics, and intervention across European hospitals.

451,"The potential of e-Health for treatment and prevention for drug dependence process of development and revision of web-based relapse prevention program ""e-SMARPP""","e-Health is the use of information and communication technologies for health, such as in patient-treatment programs, education for health care professionals, and monitoring public health. Web-/Internet-based programs, mobile applications, and wearable devices have been developed and adapted to various diseases and are now increasingly used to promote individual self-care of health. In the field of addiction, there has been a gap between potential treatment needs and available treatment services, and as such, it is necessary to develop new treatments that- are flexible and accessible. The authors developed a web-based relapse prevention program prototype dalled -""e-SMARPP"" for drug users in Japan and assessed usability. Qualitative comments from pilot study participants were assessed in detail.-The authors found areas for improvement based on participant comments and revised e-SMARPP. The main areas identified for improvement included: 1) simplify video content regarding prelease prevention sessions, 2) refine the self-monitoring calendar to monitor various health-related conditions, and 3) revise glitches that occurred when used with a smartphone. In developing an e-health program, it is important to consider commeits from targeted users to make the program user-friendly and effective.",2
452,Exploring the Impact of a Mobile Health Solution for Postpartum Pelvic Floor Muscle Training: Pilot Randomized Controlled Feasibility Study,"Background:
        
      
      The postpartum period is a vulnerable time for the pelvic floor. Early implementation of pelvic floor muscle exercises, appropriately termed as pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), in the postpartum period has been advocated because of its established effectiveness. The popularity of mobile health (mHealth) devices highlights their perceived utility. The effectiveness of various mHealth technologies with claims to support pelvic floor health and fitness is yet to be substantiated through systematic inquiry.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to determine the acceptability, feasibility, and potential effect on outcomes of an mHealth device purposed to facilitate pelvic floor muscle training among postpartum women.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 16-week mixed methods pilot study was conducted to evaluate outcomes and determine aspects of acceptability and feasibility of an mHealth device. All participants received standardized examination of their pelvic floor muscles and associated instruction on the correct performance of PFMT. Those randomized to the iBall intervention received instructions on its use. Schedules for utilization of the iBall and PFMT were not prescribed, but all participants were informed of the standard established recommendation of PFMT, which includes 3 sets of 10 exercises, 3 to 4 times a week, for the duration of the intervention period. Quantitative data included the measurement of pelvic floor muscle parameters (strength, endurance, and coordination) following the PERFECT assessment scheme: Incontinence Impact Questionnaire scores and the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) scores. Aspects of acceptability and feasibility were collected through one-to-one interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using Thorne's interpretive description approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 23 women with a mean age of 32.2 years were randomized to an intervention group (n=13) or a control group (n=10). Both groups improved on all measures. The only statistically significant change was the UDI-6 score within both groups at 16 weeks compared with baseline. There was no statistically significant difference between the intervention group and control group on any outcomes. Most participants using the iBall (n=10, 77%) indicated value in the concept of the mHealth solution. Technical difficulties (n=10, 77%), a cumbersome initiation process (n=8, 61%), and discomfort from the device (n=8, 61%) were reasons impeding intervention acceptability. Most participants (n=17, 74%) indicated that the initial assessment and training was more useful than the mHealth solution, a tenet that was echoed by all control group participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our pilot study demonstrated the potential for mHealth solution-enhanced PFMT in the early postpartum period. Usability issues in hardware and software hindered feasibility and acceptance by the participants. Our findings can inform the redesign of mHealth solutions that may be of value if acceptability and feasibility issues can be overcome.

453,A hand-targeted auxiliary personal protective equipment for intervention of fomite transmission of viruses,"In COVID-19, fomite transmission has been shown to be a major route for the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to its ability to remain on surfaces for extended durations. Although glove wearing can mitigate the risk of viral transmission especially on high touch points, it is not prevalent due to concerns on diversion of frontline medical resources, cross-contamination, social stigma, as well as discomfort and skin reactions derived from prolonged wearing. In this study, we developed FlexiPalm, a hand-targeted auxiliary personal protective equipment (PPE) against fomite transmission of viruses. FlexiPalm is a unique palmar-side hand protector designed to be skin-conforming and transparent, fabricated from medical-grade polyurethane transparent film material as a base substrate. It serves primarily as a barrier to microbial contamination like conventional gloves, but with augmented comfort and inconspicuousness to encourage a higher public adoption rate. Compared to conventional glove materials, FlexiPalm demonstrated enhanced mechanical durability and breathability, comparable hydrophobicity, and displayed a minimal adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and virus-like particles (VLP). Importantly, FlexiPalm was found to bind significantly less viral protein and VLP than artificial human skin, confirming its ability to reduce viral contamination. A pilot study involving participants completing activities of daily living showed a high level of comfort and task completion, illustrating the usability and functionality of FlexiPalm. Moreover, we have demonstrated that surface modification of FlexiPalm with microtextures enables further reduction in viral adsorption, thereby enhancing its functionality. An effective implementation of FlexiPalm will bolster PPE sustainability and lead to a paradigm shift in the global management of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in general.",0
454,Gait adaptation to visual kinematic perturbations using a real-time closed-loop brain-computer interface to a virtual reality avatar,"Objective:
        
      
      The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gait rehabilitation. While the feasibility of closed-loop BCI systems for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a BCI virtual reality (BCI-VR) environment has yet to be demonstrated. BCI-VR systems provide valuable alternatives for movement rehabilitation when wearable robots are not desirable due to medical conditions, cost, accessibility, usability, or patient preferences.
    


          Approach:
        
      
      In this study, we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during treadmill walking to control a walking avatar in a virtual environment. Fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1-3 Hz) were used for prediction; thus, the EEG features correspond to time-domain amplitude modulated potentials in the delta band. Virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. The average decoding accuracies (Pearson's r values) in real-time BCI across all subjects increased from (Hip: 0.18 ± 0.31; Knee: 0.23 ± 0.33; Ankle: 0.14 ± 0.22) on Day 1 to (Hip: 0.40 ± 0.24; Knee: 0.55 ± 0.20; Ankle: 0.29 ± 0.22) on Day 8.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      These findings have implications for the development of a real-time closed-loop EEG-based BCI-VR system for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI-VR system.",3
455,Readiness for five digital technologies in general practice: perceptions of staff in one part of southern England,"Background:
        
      
      Our aim was to understand how digital readiness within general practice varies between different technologies and to identify how demographic, workplace and external factors affect this. The technologies considered include electronic patient records, telehealth (text messaging and video consultations), patient online access, patient clinical apps and wearables, and social media.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A digital readiness survey tool was developed and used in one area of southern England during Spring 2020. Semistructured qualitative interviews were also carried out with some practice staff and digital technology company representatives.
    


          Results:
        
      
      GPs, nurses and non-clinical staff submitted 287 responses from 27 general practices (out of 33 invited).Staff digital readiness differs significantly between technologies. The mean perceived digital competency scores on 0-100 scale (high is good) were electronic patient records (75.7), telehealth (64.2), patient online access (65.8), patient clinical apps and wearables (50.8), and social media (51.2).Younger general practice staff, those in post for 5 or less years are more digitally competent and confident than older staff. This applies to both clinical and non-clinical staff. Older patient population, rurality and smaller practice size are associated with lower digital readiness. Readiness to use digital technology may have improved since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic but barriers remain in poor IT and mobile infrastructure, software usability and interoperability, and concerns about information governance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Improving digital readiness in general practice is complex and multifactorial. Issues may be alleviated by using dedicated digital implementation teams and closer collaboration between stakeholders (GPs and their staff, patients, funders, technology companies and government).",2
456,Social Communication Coaching Smartglasses: Well Tolerated in a Diverse Sample of Children and Adults With Autism,"Background:
        
      
      Augmented reality (AR) smartglasses are an emerging technology that is under investigation as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and as a research tool to aid with digital phenotyping. Tolerability of this wearable technology in people with ASD is an important area for research, especially as these individuals may experience sensory, cognitive, and attentional challenges.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and usability of a novel smartglasses system that has been designed as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism (the Brain Power Autism System [BPAS]). BPAS runs on Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smartglasses, uses both AR and affective artificial intelligence, and helps users learn key social and emotional skills.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 21 children and adults with ASD across a spectrum of severity used BPAS for a coaching session. The user's tolerability to the smartglasses, user being able to wear the smartglasses for 1 minute (initial tolerability threshold), and user being able to wear the smartglasses for the entire duration of the coaching session (whole session tolerability threshold) were determined through caregiver report.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 21 users, 19 (91%) demonstrated tolerability on all 3 measures. Caregivers reported 21 out of 21 users (100%) as tolerating the experience, while study staff found only 19 out of 21 users managed to demonstrate initial tolerability (91%). Of the 19 users who demonstrated initial tolerability, all 19 (100%) were able to use the smartglasses for the entire session (whole session tolerability threshold). Caregivers reported that 19 out of 21 users (91%) successfully used BPAS, and users surpassed caregiver expectations in 15 of 21 cases (71%). Users who could communicate reported BPAS as being comfortable (94%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This preliminary report suggests that BPAS is well tolerated and usable to a diverse age- and severity-range of people with ASD. This is encouraging as these devices are being developed as assistive technologies for people with ASD. Further research should focus on improving smartglasses design and exploring their efficacy in helping with social communication in children and adults with ASD.",3
457,An IoT-Enabled Platform for the Assessment of Physical and Mental Activities Utilizing Augmented Reality Exergaming,"Augmented reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IoT) are among the core technological elements of modern information systems and applications in which advanced features for user interactivity and monitoring are required. These technologies are continuously improving and are available nowadays in all popular programming environments and platforms, allowing for their wide adoption in many different business and research applications. In the fields of healthcare and assisted living, AR is extensively applied in the development of exergames, facilitating the implementation of innovative gamification techniques, while IoT can effectively support the users' health monitoring aspects. In this work, we present a prototype platform for exergames that combines AR and IoT on commodity mobile devices for the development of serious games in the healthcare domain. The main objective of the solution was to promote the utilization of gamification techniques to boost the users' physical activities and to assist the regular assessment of their health and cognitive statuses through challenges and quests in the virtual and real world. With the integration of sensors and wearable devices by design, the platform has the capability of real-time monitoring the users' biosignals and activities during the game, collecting data for each session, which can be analyzed afterwards by healthcare professionals.

Symposium 4 at the 20th European Conference on Eye Movement Research (ECEM) in Alicante, 20.8.2019","Wearable mobile eye trackers have great potential as they allow the measurement of eye movements during daily activities such as driving, navigating the world and doing groceries. Although mobile eye trackers have been around for some time, developing and operating these eye trackers was generally a highly technical affair. As such, mobile eye-tracking research was not feasible for most labs. Nowadays, many mobile eye trackers are available from eye-tracking manufacturers (e.g. Tobii, Pupil labs, SMI, Ergoneers) and various implementations in virtual/augmented reality have recently been released.The wide availability has caused the number of publications using a mobile eye tracker to increase quickly. Mobile eye tracking is now applied in vision science, educational science, developmental psychology, marketing research (using virtual and real supermarkets), clinical psychology, usability, architecture, medicine, and more. Yet, transitioning from lab-based studies where eye trackers are fixed to the world to studies where eye trackers are fixed to the head presents researchers with a number of problems. These problems range from the conceptual frameworks used in world-fixed and head-fixed eye tracking and how they relate to each other, to the lack of data quality comparisons and field tests of the different mobile eye trackers and how the gaze signal can be classified or mapped to the visual stimulus. Such problems need to be addressed in order to understand how world-fixed and head-fixed eye-tracking research can be compared and to understand the full potential and limits of what mobile eye-tracking can deliver. In this symposium, we bring together presenting researchers from five different institutions (Lund University, Utrecht University, Clemson University, Birkbeck University of London and Rochester Institute of Technology) addressing problems and innovative solutions across the entire breadth of mobile eye-tracking research. Hooge, presenting Hessels et al. paper, focus on the definitions of fixations and saccades held by researchers in the eyemovement field and argue how they need to be clarified in order to allow comparisons between world-fixed and head-fixed eye-tracking research. - Diaz et al. introduce machine-learning techniques for classifying the gaze signal in mobile eye-tracking contexts where head and body are unrestrained. Niehorster et al. compare data quality of mobile eye trackers during natural behavior and discuss the application range of these eye trackers. Duchowski et al. introduce a method for automatically mapping gaze to faces using computer vision techniques. Pelz et al. employ state-of-the-art techniques to map fixations to objects of interest in the scene video and align grasp and eye-movement data in the same reference frame to investigate the guidance of eye movements during manual interaction.

459,An mHealth Physical Activity Intervention for Latina Adolescents: Iterative Design of the Chicas Fuertes Study,"Background:
        
      
      Only 3% of Latina teens meet the national physical activity (PA) guidelines, and these habits appear to persist into adulthood. Developing effective interventions to increase PA in Latina teens is necessary to prevent disease and reduce disparities. Mobile technologies may be especially appropriate for this population, but mobile health (mHealth) intervention content must be designed in collaboration with the target population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to develop an mHealth PA intervention for Latina adolescents using a multistage iterative process based on the principles of human-centered design and multiple iterations of the design phase of the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, Share) framework.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      On the basis of the feedback from a previous pilot study, the planned intervention included visual social media posts and text messaging, a commercial wearable tracker, and a primarily visual website. The development of the requested mHealth intervention components was accomplished through the following 2 phases: conducting focus groups with the target population and testing the usability of the final materials with a youth advisory board (YAB) comprising Latina adolescents. Participants for focus groups (N=50) were girls aged 13-18 years who could speak and read in English and who were recruited from local high schools and after-school programs serving a high proportion of Latinos. Facilitated discussions focused on experience with PA and social media apps and specific feedback on intervention material prototypes and possible names and logos. Viable products were designed based on their feedback and then tested for usability by the YAB. YAB members (n=4) were Latinas aged 13-18 years who were not regularly active and were recruited via word of mouth and selected through an application process.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The focus group discussions yielded the following findings: PA preferences included walking, running, and group fitness classes, whereas the least popular activities were running, swimming, and biking. Most participants (n=48, 96%) used some form of social media, with Instagram being the most favored. Participants preferred text messages to be sent no more than once per day, be personalized, and be positively worded. The focus group participants preferred an intervention directly targeting Latinas and social media posts that were brightly colored, included girls of all body types, and provided specific tips and information. Modified intervention materials were generally perceived favorably by the YAB members, who provided suggestions for further refinement, including the shortening of texts and the incorporation of some Spanish phrases.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Latina teens were generally enthusiastic about an mHealth PA intervention, provided that the materials were targeted specifically to them and their preferences. Through multiple iterations of development and feedback from the target population, we gained insight into the needs of Latina teens and joined with industry partners to build a viable final product.",3
460,Feasibility and potential effects of using the electro-dress Mollii on spasticity and functioning in chronic stroke,"Background:
        
      
      Spasticity after lesions of central motor pathways may be disabling and there is a need for new, cost-effective treatment methods. One novel approach is offered by the electro-dress Mollii®, primarily designed to enhance reciprocal inhibition of spastic muscles by multifocal, transcutaneous antagonist stimulation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Mollii® suit was set individually for 20 participants living with spasticity and hemiplegia after stroke and used in the home setting for 6 weeks. Usability and perceived effects were monitored by weekly telephone interviews. Outcome was assessed by use of the NeuroFlexor™ method for quantification of the neural component (NC) of resistance to passive stretch (spasticity), and the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for total resistance, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of motor recovery for sensorimotor function in upper (FM-UE) and lower extremities (FM-LE), activity performance with the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Berg balance scale, 10 m and 6 min walk tests, and perceived functioning with the Stroke Impact Scale.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compliance was high (mean 19.25 of 21 sessions). Perceived positive effects were reported by 60% and most commonly related to decreased muscle tone (n = 9), improved gait pattern function (n = 7) and voluntary movement in the upper extremity (n = 6). On a group level, the NC decreased significantly in the wrist flexors of the affected hand (p = 0.023) and significant improvements according to FM-UE (p = 0.000) and FM-LE (p = 0.003) were seen after the intervention. No significant difference was detected with MAS or assessed activity performance, except for the ARAT (p = 0.000). FM-UE score change correlated significantly and fairly with the perceived effect in the upper extremity (r 0.498 p = 0.025) and in the corresponding analysis for the FM-LE and perceived effect in the lower extremity (r = 0.469 p = 0.037).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study indicates that the Mollii® method is feasible when used in the home setting to decrease spasticity and improve sensorimotor function. The results may guide a larger controlled study combined with rehabilitation interventions to enhance effects on activity and participation domains.

461,Deep Multivariate Domain Translation for Device Invariant Pulmonary Patient Identification from Cough and Speech Sounds,"Pulmonary audio sensing from cough and speech sounds in commodity mobile and wearable devices is increasingly used for remote pulmonary patient monitoring, home healthcare, and automated disease analysis. Patient identification is important for such applications to ensure system accuracy and integrity, and thus avoiding errors and misdiagnosis. Widespread usage and deployment of such patient identification models across various devices are challenging due to domain shift of acoustic features because of device heterogeneity. Because of this phenomenon, a patient identification model developed using audio data collected with one type of device is not usable when deployed in another type of device, which is a concern for model portability and general usability. This paper presents a framework utilizing a multivariate deep neural network regressor as a feature translator between source device and target device domains to reduce the effect of domain shift for better model portability. Extensive and empirical experiments of our translation framework consisting of two different human sound (speech and cough) based pulmonary patient identification tasks using audio data collected from 91 real patients demonstrate that it can recover up to 64.8% of lost accuracy due to domain shift across two common and widely used mobile and wearable devices: smartphone and smartwatch. Clinical Relevance- The methods presented in this paper will enable efficient and easy portability of pulmonary patient identification models from cough and speech across various mobile and wearable devices used by a patient.",9
462,A novel sensor-embedded holding device for monitoring upper extremity functions,"There are several causes that can lead to functional weakness in the hands or upper extremities (UE), such as stroke, trauma, or aging. Therefore, evaluation and monitoring of UE rehabilitation have become essential. However, most traditional evaluation tools (TETs) and assessments require clinicians to assist or are limited to specific clinical settings. Several novel assessments might apply to wearable devices, yet those devices will still need clinicians or caretakers to help with further tests. Thus, a novel UE assessment device that is user-friendly and requires minimal assistance would be needed. The cylindrical grasp is one of the common UE movements performed in daily life. Therefore, a cylindrical sensor-embedded holding device (SEHD) for training and monitoring was developed for a usability test within this research. The SEHD has 14 force sensors with an array designed to fit holding positions and a six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) to monitor grip strength, hand dexterity, acceleration, and angular velocity. Six young adults, six healthy elderly participants, and three stroke survivors had participated in this study to see if the SEHD could be used as a reference to TETs. During result analyses, where the correlation coefficient analyses were applied, forearm rotation smoothness and the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) showed a moderate negative correlation [r (16) = -0.724, p < 0.01], and the finger independence showed a moderate negative correlation with the PPT [r (10) = -0.615, p < 0.05]. There was also a highly positive correlation between the maximum pressing task and Jamar dynamometer in maximum grip strength [r (16) = 0.821, p < 0.01]. These outcomes suggest that the SEHD with simple movements could be applied as a reference for users to monitor their UE ability.",5
463,On the utility of 3D hand cursors to explore medical volume datasets with a touchless interface,"Analyzing medical volume datasets requires interactive visualization so that users can extract anatomo-physiological information in real-time. Conventional volume rendering systems rely on 2D input devices, such as mice and keyboards, which are known to hamper 3D analysis as users often struggle to obtain the desired orientation that is only achieved after several attempts. In this paper, we address which 3D analysis tools are better performed with 3D hand cursors operating on a touchless interface comparatively to a 2D input devices running on a conventional WIMP interface. The main goals of this paper are to explore the capabilities of (simple) hand gestures to facilitate sterile manipulation of 3D medical data on a touchless interface, without resorting on wearables, and to evaluate the surgical feasibility of the proposed interface next to senior surgeons (N=5) and interns (N=2). To this end, we developed a touchless interface controlled via hand gestures and body postures to rapidly rotate and position medical volume images in three-dimensions, where each hand acts as an interactive 3D cursor. User studies were conducted with laypeople, while informal evaluation sessions were carried with senior surgeons, radiologists and professional biomedical engineers. Results demonstrate its usability as the proposed touchless interface improves spatial awareness and a more fluent interaction with the 3D volume than with traditional 2D input devices, as it requires lesser number of attempts to achieve the desired orientation by avoiding the composition of several cumulative rotations, which is typically necessary in WIMP interfaces. However, tasks requiring precision such as clipping plane visualization and tagging are best performed with mouse-based systems due to noise, incorrect gestures detection and problems in skeleton tracking that need to be addressed before tests in real medical environments might be performed.",3
464,A system for portable sleep apnea diagnosis using an embedded data capturing module,"Sleep apnea (SA) is a very common disease with serious health consequences, yet is very under-diagnosed, partially because of the high cost and limited accessibility of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). The purpose of this work is to introduce a newly developed portable system for the diagnosis of SA at home that is both reliable and easy to use. The system includes personal devices for recording breath sounds and airflow during sleep and diagnostic algorithms to process the recorded data. The data capturing device consists of a wearable face frame with an embedded electronic module featuring a unidirectional microphone, a differential microphone preamplifier, a microcontroller with an onboard differential analogue to digital converter, and a microSD memory card. The device provides continuous data capturing for 8 h. Upon completion of the recording session, the memory card is returned to a location for acoustic analysis. We recruited 49 subjects who used the device independently at home, after which each subject answered a usability questionnaire. Random data samples were selected to measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a gauge of hardware functionality. A subset of 11 subjects used the device on 2 different nights and their results were compared to examine diagnostic reproducibility. Independent of those, system's performance was evaluated against PSG in the lab environment in 32 subject. The overall success rate of applying the device in un-attended settings was 94 % and the overall rating for ease-of-use was 'excellent'. Signal examination showed excellent capturing of breath sounds with an average SNR of 31.7 dB. Nine of the 11 (82 %) subjects had equivalent results on both nights, which is consistent with reported inter-night variability. The system showed 96 % correlation with simultaneously performed in-lab PSG.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results suggest excellent usability and performance of this system and provide a strong rationale to further improve it and test its robustness in a larger study.",5
465,Activity Monitors as Support for Older Persons' Physical Activity in Daily Life: Qualitative Study of the Users' Experiences,"Background:
        
      
      Falls are a major threat to the health and independence of seniors. Regular physical activity (PA) can prevent 40% of all fall injuries. The challenge is to motivate and support seniors to be physically active. Persuasive systems can constitute valuable support for persons aiming at establishing and maintaining healthy habits. However, these systems need to support effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) for increasing older adults' PA and meet the senior users' requirements and preferences. Therefore, involving users as codesigners of new systems can be fruitful. Prestudies of the user's experience with similar solutions can facilitate future user-centered design of novel persuasive systems.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to investigate how seniors experience using activity monitors (AMs) as support for PA in daily life. The addressed research questions are as follows: (1) What are the overall experiences of senior persons, of different age and balance function, in using wearable AMs in daily life?; (2) Which aspects did the users perceive relevant to make the measurements as meaningful and useful in the long-term perspective?; and (3) What needs and requirements did the users perceive as more relevant for the activity monitors to be useful in a long-term perspective?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This qualitative interview study included 8 community-dwelling older adults (median age: 83 years). The participants' experiences in using two commercial AMs together with tablet-based apps for 9 days were investigated. Activity diaries during the usage and interviews after the usage were exploited to gather user experience. Comments in diaries were summarized, and interviews were analyzed by inductive content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The users (n=8) perceived that, by using the AMs, their awareness of own PA had increased. However, the AMs' impact on the users' motivation for PA and activity behavior varied between participants. The diaries showed that self-estimated physical effort varied between participants and varied for each individual over time. Additionally, participants reported different types of accomplished activities; talking walks was most frequently reported. To be meaningful, measurements need to provide the user with a reliable receipt of whether his or her current activity behavior is sufficient for reaching an activity goal. Moreover, praise when reaching a goal was described as motivating feedback. To be useful, the devices must be easy to handle. In this study, the users perceived wearables as easy to handle, whereas tablets were perceived difficult to maneuver. Users reported in the diaries that the devices had been functional 78% (58/74) of the total test days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Activity monitors can be valuable for supporting seniors' PA. However, the potential of the solutions for a broader group of seniors can significantly be increased. Areas of improvement include reliability, usability, and content supporting effective BCTs with respect to increasing older adults' PA.",3
466,Remote assessment of disease and relapse in major depressive disorder (RADAR-MDD): a multi-centre prospective cohort study protocol,"Background:
        
      
      There is a growing body of literature highlighting the role that wearable and mobile remote measurement technology (RMT) can play in measuring symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). Outcomes assessment typically relies on self-report, which can be biased by dysfunctional perceptions and current symptom severity. Predictors of depressive relapse include disrupted sleep, reduced sociability, physical activity, changes in mood, prosody and cognitive function, which are all amenable to measurement via RMT. This study aims to: 1) determine the usability, feasibility and acceptability of RMT; 2) improve and refine clinical outcome measurement using RMT to identify current clinical state; 3) determine whether RMT can provide information predictive of depressive relapse and other critical outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      RADAR-MDD is a multi-site prospective cohort study, aiming to recruit 600 participants with a history of depressive disorder across three sites: London, Amsterdam and Barcelona. Participants will be asked to wear a wrist-worn activity tracker and download several apps onto their smartphones. These apps will be used to either collect data passively from existing smartphone sensors, or to deliver questionnaires, cognitive tasks, and speech assessments. The wearable device, smartphone sensors and questionnaires will collect data for up to 2-years about participants' sleep, physical activity, stress, mood, sociability, speech patterns, and cognitive function. The primary outcome of interest is MDD relapse, defined via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Self-Report questionnaire (IDS-SR) and the World Health Organisation's self-reported Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study aims to provide insight into the early predictors of major depressive relapse, measured unobtrusively via RMT. If found to be acceptable to patients and other key stakeholders and able to provide clinically useful information predictive of future deterioration, RMT has potential to change the way in which depression and other long-term conditions are measured and managed.",6
467,Recent Academic Research on Clinically Relevant Digital Measures: Systematic Review,"Background:
        
      
      Digital clinical measures collected via various digital sensing technologies such as smartphones, smartwatches, wearables, ingestibles, and implantables are increasingly used by individuals and clinicians to capture health outcomes or behavioral and physiological characteristics of individuals. Although academia is taking an active role in evaluating digital sensing products, academic contributions to advancing the safe, effective, ethical, and equitable use of digital clinical measures are poorly characterized.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review to characterize the nature of academic research on digital clinical measures and to compare and contrast the types of sensors used and the sources of funding support for specific subareas of this research.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a PubMed search using a range of search terms to retrieve peer-reviewed articles reporting US-led academic research on digital clinical measures between January 2019 and February 2021. We screened each publication against specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then identified and categorized research studies based on the types of academic research, sensors used, and funding sources. Finally, we compared and contrasted the funding support for these specific subareas of research and sensor types.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search retrieved 4240 articles of interest. Following the screening, 295 articles remained for data extraction and categorization. The top five research subareas included operations research (research analysis; n=225, 76%), analytical validation (n=173, 59%), usability and utility (data visualization; n=123, 42%), verification (n=93, 32%), and clinical validation (n=83, 28%). The three most underrepresented areas of research into digital clinical measures were ethics (n=0, 0%), security (n=1, 0.5%), and data rights and governance (n=1, 0.5%). Movement and activity trackers were the most commonly studied sensor type, and physiological (mechanical) sensors were the least frequently studied. We found that government agencies are providing the most funding for research on digital clinical measures (n=192, 65%), followed by independent foundations (n=109, 37%) and industries (n=56, 19%), with the remaining 12% (n=36) of these studies completely unfunded.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Specific subareas of academic research related to digital clinical measures are not keeping pace with the rapid expansion and adoption of digital sensing products. An integrated and coordinated effort is required across academia, academic partners, and academic funders to establish the field of digital clinical measures as an evidence-based field worthy of our trust.",0
468,FEEL: a system for frequent event and electrodermal activity labeling,"The wide availability of low-cost wearable biophysiological sensors enables us to measure how the environment and our experiences impact our physiology. This creates a challenge: in order to interpret the longitudinal data, we require the matching contextual information as well. Collecting continuous biophysiological data makes it unfeasible to rely solely on our memory for contextual information. In this paper, we first present an architecture and implementation of a system for the acquisition, processing, and visualization of biophysiological signals and contextual information. Next, we present the results of a user study: users wore electrodermal activity wrist sensors that measured their autonomic arousal. These users uploaded the sensor data at the end of each day. At first, they annotated their events at the end of each day; then, after a two-day break, they annotated the data from two days earlier. One group of users had access to both the signal and the contextual information collected by the mobile phone and the other group could only access the biophysiological signal. At the end of the study, the users filled in a system usability scale and user experience surveys. Our results show that the system enables the users to annotate biophysiological signals at a greater effectiveness than the current state of the art while also providing very good usability.",3
469,A preliminary study of telemedicine for patients with hepatic glycogen storage disease and their healthcare providers: from bedside to home site monitoring,"Background:
        
      
      The purpose of this project was to develop a telemedicine platform that supports home site monitoring and integrates biochemical, physiological, and dietary parameters for individual patients with hepatic glycogen storage disease (GSD).
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      The GSD communication platform (GCP) was designed with input from software developers, GSD patients, researchers, and healthcare providers. In phase 1, prototyping and software design of the GCP has occurred. The GCP was composed of a GSD App for patients and a GSD clinical dashboard for healthcare providers. In phase 2, the GCP was tested by retrospective patient data entry. The following software functionalities were included (a) dietary registration and prescription module, (b) emergency protocol module, and (c) data import functions for continuous glucose monitor devices and activity wearables. In phase 3, the GSD App was implemented in a pilot study of eight patients with GSD Ia (n = 3), GSD IIIa (n = 1), and GSD IX (n = 4). Usability was measured by the system usability scale (SUS). The mean SUS score was 64/100 [range: 38-93].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This report describes the design, development, and validation process of a telemedicine platform for patients with hepatic GSD. The GCP can facilitate home site monitoring and data exchange between patients with hepatic GSD and healthcare providers under varying circumstances. In the future, the GCP may support cross-border healthcare, second opinion processes and clinical trials, and could possibly also be adapted for other diseases for which a medical diet is the cornerstone.",2
470,A Comparison of Vibrotactile Feedback and Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) for Motor Response During Active Hand Movement,"Wearable haptic technologies have garnered recent widespread attention due to increased accessibility, functionality, and affordability. These systems typically provide haptic feedback to augment the human ability to interact with their environment. This study compares two haptic feedback modalities, vibrotactile and EMS, against visual feedback to elicit a motor response during active hand movement. Forty-five participants, divided into three groups, performed a task to touch their face and received one of three possible sensory feedback cues, namely visual, vibrotactile, and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), to interrupt their movement and avoid touching their face. Two quantitative performance measures are used in the comparison, the response time (time elapsed from stimulation to motor response) and the error rate (percentage that the user fails to avoid touching their face). Results showed that vibrotactile and EMS feedback yielded significantly faster response time than visual feedback, while no significant differences between vibrotactile and EMS were observed. Furthermore, the error rate was significantly lower for EMS compared to visual feedback, whereas no significant differences were observed between vibrotactile and visual feedback. In conclusion, it seems that EMS feedback is preferable for applications where errors are not tolerable (critical medical applications), whereas vibrotactile is superior for non-critical applications due to its low cost and higher usability (more pleasant compared to EMS).",7
471,Novel cloud and SOA-based framework for e-health monitoring using wireless biosensors,"Various and independent studies are showing that an exponential increase of chronic diseases (CDs) is exhausting governmental and private healthcare systems to an extent that some countries allocate half of their budget to healthcare systems. To benefit from the IT development, e-health monitoring and prevention approaches revealed to be among top promising solutions. In fact, well-implemented monitoring and prevention schemes have reported a decent reduction of CDs risk and have narrowed their effects, on both patients' health conditions and on government budget spent on healthcare. In this paper, we propose a framework to collect patients' data in real time, perform appropriate nonintrusive monitoring, and propose medical and/or life style engagements, whenever needed and appropriate. The framework, which relies on service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the Cloud, allows a seamless integration of different technologies, applications, and services. It also integrates mobile technologies to smoothly collect and communicate vital data from a patient's wearable biosensors while considering the mobile devices' limited capabilities and power drainage in addition to intermittent network disconnections. Then, data are stored in the Cloud and made available via SOA to allow easy access by physicians, paramedics, or any other authorized entity. A case study has been developed to evaluate the usability of the framework, and the preliminary results that have been analyzed are showing very promising results.",2
472,ProHealth eCoach: user-centered design and development of an eCoach app to promote healthy lifestyle with personalized activity recommendations,"Background:
        
      
      Regular physical activity (PA), healthy habits, and an appropriate diet are recommended guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user's context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user's requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the ""Google Material Design"" guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU).",2
473,Applying a Digital Health Checklist and Readability Tools to Improve Informed Consent for Digital Health Research,"Background: As research involving human participants increasingly occurs with the aid of digital tools (e.g., mobile apps, wearable and remote pervasive sensors), the consent content and delivery process is changing. Informed consent documents to participate in research are lengthy and difficult for prospective participants to read and understand. As the consent communication will need to include concepts and procedures unique to digital health research, making that information accessible and meaningful to the prospective participant is critical for consent to be informed. This paper describes a methodology that researchers can apply when developing a consent communication for digital health research. Methods: A consent document approved by a US institutional review board was deconstructed into segments that aligned with federal requirements for informed consent. Three researchers independently revised each segment of text with a goal of achieving a readability score between a 6-8th grade level. The team then consulted with an external readability expert well-versed in revising informed consent documents into ""plain language."" The resulting text was evaluated using Microsoft Word and Online-Utility accessibility software. The final step involved adding visual images and graphics to complement the text. The Digital Health Checklist consent prototype builder was then used to identify areas where the consent content could be expanded to address four key domains of Access and Usability, Privacy, Risks and Benefits, and Data Management. Results: The approved consent was evaluated at a 12.6 grade reading level, whereas the revised language by our study team received 12.4, 12, and 12.58, respectively. The final consent document synthesized the most readable of the three revised versions and was further revised to include language recommended by the software tool for improving readability, which resulted in a final revised consent readability score of a 9.2 grade level. Moreover, word count was reduced from 6,424 in the original consent to 679 in the rewritten consent form. Conclusion: Utilizing an iterative process to design an accessible informed consent document is a first step in achieving meaningful consent to participate in digital health research. This paper describes how a consent form approved by an institutional review board can be made more accessible to a prospective research participant by improving the document readability score, reducing the word count and assessing alignment with the Digital Health Checklist.",8
474,The combined action of a passive exoskeleton and an EMG-controlled neuroprosthesis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation: First results of the RETRAINER project,"The combined use of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and robotic technologies is advocated to improve rehabilitation outcomes after stroke. This work describes an arm rehabilitation system developed within the European project RETRAINER. The system consists of a passive 4-degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton equipped with springs to provide gravity compensation and electromagnetic brakes to hold target positions. FES is integrated in the system to provide additional support to the most impaired muscles. FES is triggered based on the volitional EMG signal of the same stimulated muscle; in order to encourage the active involvement of the patient the volitional EMG is also monitored throughout the task execution and based on it a happy or sad emoji is visualized at the end of each task. The control interface control of the system provides a GUI and multiple software tools to organize rehabilitation exercises and monitor rehabilitation progress. The functionality and the usability of the system was evaluated on four stroke patients. All patients were able to use the system and judged positively its wearability and the provided support. They were able to trigger the stimulation based on their residual muscle activity and provided different levels of active involvement in the exercise, in agreement with their level of impairment. A randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the RETRAINER system to improve arm function after stroke is currently ongoing.",0
475,A heel-strike real-time auditory feedback device to promote motor learning in children who have cerebral palsy: a pilot study to test device accuracy and feasibility to use a music and dance-based learning paradigm,"Background:
        
      
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a developmental disorder of movement and posture that occurs due to damage to the developing nervous system. As part of therapy, wearable sensors that trigger interactive feedback may provide multi-sensory guidance and motivation. A prototype of a heel-strike real-time feedback system has been developed which records the number of heel strikes during gait and indicates successful heel contact through real-time auditory feedback. The first aim of this feasibility study was to test the prototype accuracy.Since the end user for this device is a child, the device should be esthetically appealing and sufficiently motivating for children to perform repetitive challenging therapeutic movements. The second aim of this study was to collect feedback from the subjects with regard to the device usability and understand if the bell sound used as feedback used was motivating enough for children to continue using the prototype. This would help us in developing the next generation of the device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The prototype was tested with typically developing children and children who have CP. The accuracy in detecting heel strikes was calculated. As part of the study, the subjects were also asked questions to test the device compliance and acceptability of the musical beats with the pediatric population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The device accuracy in identifying heel strikes is 97.44% (95% CI 96.31, 98.88%). The subjects did not show any hesitation to put on the device and the sound feedback motivated them to move. Based on this pilot study, a minimum age limit of 5 years is appropriate and the intervention study should be conducted for no more than 30 min per week.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The pilot study showed that a main study can be conducted to test auditory feedback as an intervention to promote motor learning in children who have cerebral palsy. No adverse event or safety issues were reported in the feasibility study.",3
476,Comparison of Three Prototypes of PPG Sensors for Continual Real-Time Measurement in Weak Magnetic Field,"This paper is focused on investigation of three developed prototypes of sensors based on the photoplethysmography (PPG) principle for continual measurement of the PPG signal in the magnetic field environment with the inherent radiofrequency and electromagnetic disturbance. The tested prototypes differ in the used optical part of the PPG sensor and their working mode, control unit, power supply, and applied Bluetooth (BT) communication methods. The main aim of the current work was motivated by finding suitable and universal parameter settings for PPG signal real-time recording in different working mode conditions. Comparative measurements in laboratory conditions by certified commercial pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitor (BPM) devices show good stability and proper accuracy of finally determined heart rate values. The supplementary investigation certifies the necessity of the placement of the pressure cuff of the BPM device on the opposite arm than the tested PPG sensor. Measurement experiments inside the scanning area of the running weak field magnetic resonance scanner verify proper function and practical usability of sensed PPG signals for further processing and analysis in all three prototype cases. Additional testing shows that the BT transmission in the scanning area has no visible influence on the quality of the finally obtained scanner images.",5
477,"Rationale, Theoretical Underpinnings, and Design of HEAR-aware: Providing Adults With Hearing Loss With Tailored Support to Self-Manage Their Hearing Problems via a Smartphone App, as an Alternative to Hearing Aids","Purpose An alarming two thirds of adults aged 50 years or over with hearing impairment who could benefit from hearing aids do not own any, leaving these adults with no support to self-manage their hearing problems. In the HEAR-aware project, it is hypothesized that self-management can be facilitated via a smartphone app if its educational content is tailored to a person's dynamic stage of readiness to take action on their hearing (stage of change) and to a person's dynamic acoustical situations (as measured via a wearable microphone) and associated challenges (as captured via ecological momentary assessment). As such, the HEAR-aware app would be an ecological momentary intervention. This research note describes the rationale and theoretical underpinnings of the app, as well as the rationale for planning a series of studies to develop and evaluate it. Study Designs After a preparatory phase, Study 1 includes qualitative group interviews to assess user needs. Next, a creative session will be held, in which all stakeholders involved will work toward a specified version of the app. Subsequently, prototypes of the app will be developed and pilot-tested (Pilot Studies 2A and 2B). Users' usage and ratings (usability and quality indicators) of the app's elements will be examined and processed in the app. Lastly, the effectiveness of the app's final version will be examined in a randomized controlled trial (Study 3). Discussion The project's merits and challenges will be discussed.",8
478,Toward Improved Treatment and Empowerment of Individuals With Parkinson Disease: Design and Evaluation of an Internet of Things System,"Background:
        
      
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic degenerative disorder that causes progressive neurological deterioration with profound effects on the affected individual's quality of life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve patient empowerment and clinical decision support in PD care. Home-based disease monitoring is an emerging information technology with the potential to transform the care of patients with chronic illnesses. Its acceptance and role in PD care need to be elucidated both among patients and caregivers.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Our main objective was to develop a novel home-based monitoring system (named EMPARK) with patient and clinician interface to improve patient empowerment and clinical care in PD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used elements of design science research and user-centered design for requirement elicitation and subsequent information and communications technology (ICT) development. Functionalities of the interfaces were the subject of user-centric multistep evaluation complemented by semantic analysis of the recorded end-user reactions. The ICT structure of EMPARK was evaluated using the ICT for patient empowerment model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Software and hardware system architecture for the collection and calculation of relevant parameters of disease management via home monitoring were established. Here, we describe the patient interface and the functional characteristics and evaluation of a novel clinician interface. In accordance with our previous findings with regard to the patient interface, our current results indicate an overall high utility and user acceptance of the clinician interface. Special characteristics of EMPARK in key areas of interest emerged from end-user evaluations, with clear potential for future system development and deployment in daily clinical practice. Evaluation through the principles of ICT for patient empowerment model, along with prior findings from patient interface evaluation, suggests that EMPARK has the potential to empower patients with PD.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The EMPARK system is a novel home monitoring system for providing patients with PD and the care team with feedback on longitudinal disease activities. User-centric development and evaluation of the system indicated high user acceptance and usability. The EMPARK infrastructure would empower patients and could be used for future applications in daily care and research.",2
479,Development of a stick-on hip protector: A multiple methods study to improve hip protector design for older adults in the acute care environment,"Introduction:
        
      
      Over 90% of hip fractures in older adults result from falls, and hospital patients are at especially high risk. Specific types of wearable hip protectors have been shown to reduce hip fracture risk during a fall by up to 80%, but user compliance has averaged less than 50%. We describe the development and evaluation of a ""stick-on"" hip protector (secured over the hip with a skin-friendly adhesive) for older patients in acute care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An initial version of the product was evaluated with six female patients (aged 76-91) in a hospital ward, who were asked to wear it for one week. We subsequently refined the product through biomechanical testing and solicited feedback from 43 health professionals on a second prototype.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The first prototype was worn by five of six patients for the full week or duration of their hospital stay. The second prototype (20 mm thick, surface area 19 × 15.5 cm) provided 36% force attenuation, more than common garment-based models (20-21%). Feedback from patients and health professionals highlighted usability, comfort, cost, and appearance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results from biomechanical and user testing support the need for further work to determine the value of stick-on hip protectors in acute care.",2
480,A Field Study to Capture Events of Interest (EoI) from Living Labs Using Wearables for Spatiotemporal Monitoring Towards a Framework of Smart Health (sHealth),"Everyday wearables such as smartwatches or smart bands can play a pivotal role in the field of fitness and wellness and hold the prospect to be used for early disease detection and monitoring towards Smart Health (sHealth). One of the challenges is the extraction of reliable biomarkers from data collected using these devices in the real world (Living Labs). In this yearlong field study, we collected the nocturnal instantaneous heart rate from 9 participants using wrist-worn commercial smart bands and extracted heart rate variability features (HRV). In addition, we measured core body temperature using our custom-designed flexible Inkjet-Printed (IJP) temperature sensor and SpO2 with a finger pulse oximeter. The core body temperature along with user-reported symptoms have been used for automated spatiotemporal monitoring of flu symptoms severity in real-time. The extracted HRV feature values are within the 95% confidence interval of normative values and shows an anticipated trend for gender and age. The resulting dataset from this study is a novel addition and may be used for future investigations.Clinical Relevance- The findings of this study shows usability of wearables in detection and monitoring of diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea reducing the prevalence of undiagnosed cases. This framework also has potentials to monitor outbreaks of flu and other diseases with spatiotemporal distribution.",0
481,Novel Bluetooth-Enabled Tubeless Insulin Pump: A User Experience Design Approach for a Connected Digital Diabetes Management Platform,"Background:
        
      
      Medical device technology is evolving at a rapid pace, with increasing patient expectations to use modern technologies for diabetes management. With the significant expansion of the use of wireless technology and complex, securely connected digital platforms in medical devices, end user needs and behaviors have become essential areas of focus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This article provides a detailed description of the user-centered design approach implemented in developing the Omnipod DASH™ Insulin Management System (Insulet Corp., Billerica, MA) Bluetooth®-enabled locked-down Android device handheld controller (Personal Diabetes Manager, PDM). Key methodologies used in the PDM design are described, including how the science of user experience (UX) was integrated into new agile product development. UX methods employed included heuristic evaluations of insulin pumps, iterative formative usability testing, information architecture studies, in-home ethnographic visits, participatory design activities, and interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over 343 users participated in UX research and testing. Key design choices informed by UX research included updating the layout of critical data on the PDM home page, providing access to requested contextual information while a bolus is in progress, and creating an easy-to-understand visual of a 24-hour basal program. Task completion rates for comprehending information on the PDM home page were 87% or greater. The System Usability Scale result for the design prior to limited market release was 84.4 ± 13.4 (out of 100; n = 37).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The UX process described in this article can serve as a blueprint for medical device manufacturers seeking to enhance product development. Adopting UX research methodologies will help ensure that new diabetes devices are safe, easy-to-use, and meet the needs of users.",0
482,Effect of Spatial Disorientation in a Virtual Environment on Gait and Vital Features in Patients with Dementia: Pilot Single-Blind Randomized Control Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Orientation deficits are among the most devastating consequences of early dementia. Digital navigation devices could overcome these deficits if adaptable to the user's needs (ie, provide situation-aware, proactive navigation assistance). To fulfill this task, systems need to automatically detect spatial disorientation from sensors in real time. Ideally, this would require field studies consisting of real-world navigation. However, such field studies can be challenging and are not guaranteed to cover sufficient instances of disorientation due to the large variability of real-world settings and a lack of control over the environment.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Extending a foregoing field study, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of using a sophisticated virtual reality (VR) setup, which allows a more controlled observation of disorientation states and accompanying behavioral and physiological parameters in cognitively healthy older people and people with dementia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this feasibility study, we described the experimental design and pilot outcomes of an ongoing study aimed at investigating the effect of disorientation on gait and selected physiological features in a virtual laboratory. We transferred a real-world navigation task to a treadmill-based virtual system for gait analysis. Disorientation was induced by deliberately manipulating landmarks in the VR projection. Associated responses in motion behavior and physiological parameters were recorded by sensors. Primary outcomes were variations in motion and physiological parameters, frequency of disorientation, and questionnaire-derived usability estimates (immersion and perceived control of the gait system) for our population of interest. At this time, the included participants were 9 cognitively healthy older participants [5/9 women, 4/9 men; mean age 70 years, SD 4.40; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) mean 29, SD 0.70) and 4 participants with dementia (2/4 women, 2/4 men; mean age 78 years, SD 2.30 years; MMSE mean 20.50, SD 7.54). Recruitment is ongoing, with the aim of including 30 cognitively healthy older participants and 20 participants with dementia.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All 13 participants completed the experiment. Patients' route was adapted by shortening it relative to the original route. Average instances of disorientation were 21.40, 36.50, and 37.50 for the cognitively healthy older control, cognitively healthy older experimental participants, and participants with dementia, respectively. Questionnaire outcomes indicated that participants experienced adequate usability and immersion; 4.30 for presence, 3.73 for involvement, and 3.85 for realism of 7 possible points, indicating a good overall ability to cope with the experiment. Variations were also observed in motion and physiological parameters during instances of disorientation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study presents the first feasibility outcomes of a study investigating the viability of using a sophisticated VR setup, based on an earlier real-world navigation study, to study spatial disorientation among cognitively healthy older people and people with dementia. Preliminary outcomes give confidence to the notion that our setup can be used to assess motion and physiological markers of disorientation, even in people with cognitive decline.

483,A Pilot Study to Assess the Feasibility of Collecting and Transmitting Clinical Trial Data with Mobile Technologies,"Background:
        
      
      The use of mobile technologies for data capture and transmission has the potential to streamline clinical trials, but researchers lack methods for collecting, processing, and interpreting data from these tools.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the performance of a technical platform for collecting and transmitting data from six mobile technologies in the clinic and at home, to apply methods for comparing them to clinical standard devices, and to measure their usability, including how willing subjects were to use them on a regular basis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In part 1 of the study, conducted over 3 weeks in the clinic, we tested two device pairs (mobile vs. clinical standard blood pressure monitor and mobile vs. clinical standard spirometer) on 25 healthy volunteers. In part 2 of the study, conducted over 3 days both in the clinic and at home, we tested the same two device pairs as in part 1, plus four additional pairs (mobile vs. clinical standard pulse oximeter, glucose meter, weight scale, and activity monitor), on 22 healthy volunteers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data collection reliability was 98.1% in part 1 of the study and 95.8% in part 2 (the percentages exclude the wearable activity monitor, which collects data continuously). In part 1, 20 of 1,049 overall expected measurements were missing (1.9%), and in part 2, 45 of 1,083 were missing (4.2%). The most common reason for missing data was a single malfunctioning spirometer (13 of 20 total missed readings) in part 1, and that the subject did not take the measurement (22 of 45 total missed readings) in part 2. Also in part 2, a higher proportion of at-home measurements than in-clinic readings were missing (12.6 vs. 2.7%). The data from this experimental study were unable to establish repeatability or agreement for every mobile technology; only the pulse oximeter demonstrated repeatability, and only the weight scale demonstrated agreement with the clinical standard device. Most mobile technologies received high ""willingness to use"" ratings from the patients on the questionnaires.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrated that the wireless data transmission and processing platform was dependable. It also identified three critical areas of study for advancing the use of mobile technologies in clinical research: (1) if a mobile technology captures more than one type of endpoint (such as blood pressure and pulse), repeatability and agreement may need to be established for each endpoint to be included in a clinical trial; (2) researchers need to develop criteria for excluding invalid device readings (to be identified by algorithms in real time) for the population studied using ranges based on accumulated subject data and established norms; and (3) careful examination of a mobile technology's performance (reliability, repeatability, and agreement with accepted reference devices) during pilot testing is essential, even for medical devices approved by regulators.",9
484,An adaptive model approach for quantitative wrist rigidity evaluation during deep brain stimulation surgery,"Intraoperative evaluation of the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation includes evaluation of the effect on rigidity. A subjective semi-quantitative scale is used, dependent on the examiner perception and experience. A system was proposed previously, aiming to tackle this subjectivity, using quantitative data and providing real-time feedback of the computed rigidity reduction, hence supporting the physician decision. This system comprised of a gyroscope-based motion sensor in a textile band, placed in the patients hand, which communicated its measurements to a laptop. The latter computed a signal descriptor from the angular velocity of the hand during wrist flexion in DBS surgery. The first approach relied on using a general rigidity reduction model, regardless of the initial severity of the symptom. Thus, to enhance the performance of the previously presented system, we aimed to develop models for high and low baseline rigidity, according to the examiner assessment before any stimulation. This would allow a more patient-oriented approach. Additionally, usability was improved by having in situ processing in a smartphone, instead of a computer. Such system has shown to be reliable, presenting an accuracy of 82.0% and a mean error of 3.4%. Relatively to previous results, the performance was similar, further supporting the importance of considering the cogwheel rigidity to better infer about the reduction in rigidity. Overall, we present a simple, wearable, mobile system, suitable for intra-operatory conditions during DBS, supporting a physician in decision-making when setting stimulation parameters.",7
485,Reliability and validity of a new accelerometer-based device for detecting physical activities and energy expenditure,"Background:
        
      
      Objective assessments of sedentary behavior and physical activity (PA) by using accelerometer-based wearable devices are ever expanding, given their importance in the global context of health maintenance. This study aimed to determine the reliability and validity of a new accelerometer-based analyzer (Fibion) for detecting different PAs and estimating energy expenditure (EE) during a simulated free-living day.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study consisted of two parts: a reliability (n = 18) and a validity (n = 19) test. Reliability was assessed by a 45 min protocol of repeated sitting, standing, and walking (i.e., 3 × 15 min, repeated twice), using both Fibion and ActiGraph. Validity was assessed by a 12 h continuous sequence tasks of different types (sitting, standing, walking, and cycling) and intensities (light [LPA], moderate [MPA], and vigorous [VPA]) of PA. Two Fibion devices were worn on the thigh (FT) and in the pocket (FP), respectively and were compared with criteria measures, such as direct observation (criterion 1) and oxygen consumption by a portable gas analyzer, K4b2 (criterion 2).
    


          Results:
        
      
      FT (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs): 0.687-0.806) provided similar reliability as the Actigraph (ICCs: 0.661-0.806) for EE estimation. However, the measurement error (ME) of FT compared to the actual time records indicated an underestimation of duration by 5.1 ± 1.2%, 3.8 ± 0.3% and 14.9 ± 2.6% during sitting, walking, and standing, respectively. During the validity test, FT but not FP showed a moderate agreement but lager variance with the criteria (1 and 2) in assessing duration of sitting, long sitting, LPA, MPA, and VPA (p > 0.05, ICCs: 0.071-0.537), as well as for EE estimation of standing, LPA, MPA, and VPA (p > 0.05, ICCs: 0.673-0.894).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      FT provided similar reliability to that of the Actigraph. However, low correlations between subsequent measurements of both devices indicated large random MEs, which were somewhat diminished during the simulated 12 h real-life test. Furthermore, FT may accurately determine the types, intensities of PA and EE during prolonged periods with substantial changes in postures, indicating that the location of the accelerometer is essential. Further study with a large cohort is needed to confirm the usability of Fibion, especially for detecting the low-intensity PAs.",1
486,Designing Effective eHealth Interventions for Underserved Groups: Five Lessons From a Decade of eHealth Intervention Design and Deployment,"Despite the proliferation of eHealth interventions, such as web portals, for health information dissemination or the use of mobile apps and wearables for health monitoring, research has shown that underserved groups do not benefit proportionately from these eHealth interventions. This is largely because of usability issues and the lack of attention to the broader structural, physical, and psychosocial barriers to technology adoption and use. The objective of this paper is to draw lessons from a decade of experience in designing different user-centered eHealth interventions (eg, web portals and health apps) to inform future work in leveraging technology to address health disparities. We draw these lessons from a series of interventions from the work we have done over 15 years in the Viswanath laboratory at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, focusing on three projects that used web portals and health apps targeted toward underserved groups. The projects were the following: Click to Connect, which was a community-based eHealth intervention that aimed to improve internet skills and health literacy among underserved groups by providing home access to high-speed internet, computer, and internet training classes, as well as a dedicated health web portal with ongoing technical support; PLANET MassCONECT, which was a knowledge translation project that built capacity among community-based organizations in Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester in Massachusetts to adopt evidence-based health promotion programs; and Smartphone App for Public Health, which was a mobile health research that facilitated both participatory (eg, surveys) and passive data (eg, geolocations and web-browsing behaviors) collection for the purpose of understanding tobacco message exposure in individuals' built environment. Through our work, we distilled five key principles for researchers aiming to design eHealth interventions for underserved groups. They are as follows: develop a strategic road map to address communication inequalities (ie, a concrete action plan to identify the barriers faced by underserved groups and customize specific solutions to each of them), engage multiple stakeholders from the beginning for the long haul, design with usability-readability and navigability-in mind, build privacy safeguards into eHealth interventions and communicate privacy-utility tradeoffs in simplicity, and strive for an optimal balance between open science aspirations and protection of underserved groups.",2
487,Perspectives and expectations of stroke survivors using egocentric cameras for monitoring hand function at home: a mixed methods study,"Purpose:
        
      
      Most stroke survivors have remaining upper limb impairment six months after stroke and require additional rehabilitation and help from family members to enhance their performance of daily activities. First-person (egocentric) video has been proposed to capture the activities of daily living (ADLs) of stroke survivors in order to assess their hand function at home. This study explored the experiences and expectations of stroke survivors regarding the use of egocentric cameras in daily life for rehabilitation applications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-one chronic stroke survivors recruited for the study were asked to record three sessions of 1.5 h of video of their ADLs at home over two weeks. Their experiences and expectations after completing the recordings were discussed using a structured questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. The questionnaire and interview data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis, respectively. The results were further integrated using a mixed methods analysis for mutual explanation and elaboration.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The themes generated were Camera Usability, Privacy Concerns Related to Home Recordings, Future Use of the Camera in Public, and Information Usefulness. The participants perceived that the camera was easy to use, the information obtained from the recordings was beneficial, and no major concerns about recording at home. A discreet camera and a solution to privacy issues were prerequisites to recording tasks in public.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There was high acceptance among stroke survivors regarding the use of wearable cameras for rehabilitation purposes in the future. Concerns to be managed include discomfort, self-consciousness, and the privacy of others.Implications for rehabilitationThe egocentric camera was easy for the stroke survivors to use at home. However, they expressed a preference for cameras to be less noticeable and lighter in the future to minimize self-consciousness and discomfort.Expectations for future use of an egocentric camera for upper limb rehabilitation at home from the perspectives of stroke survivors included receiving feedback on their hand function in daily life and guidance on how to improve function.Privacy concerns of stroke survivors regarding recording activities of daily living were mostly avoidable by planning in advance. However, some personal hygiene tasks and virtual meetings were recorded by accident. A checklist of common activities that may raise privacy issues can be provided along with the camera to serve as a reminder to avoid these issues.",3
488,User-Centered Design Methodologies for the Prototype Development of a Smart Harness and Related System to Provide Haptic Cues to Persons with Parkinson's Disease,"This paper describes the second part of the PASSO (Parkinson smart sensory cues for older users) project, which designs and tests an innovative haptic biofeedback system based on a wireless body sensor network using a smartphone and different smartwatches specifically designed to rehabilitate postural disturbances in persons with Parkinson's disease. According to the scientific literature on the use of smart devices to transmit sensory cues, vibrotactile feedback (particularly on the trunk) seems promising for improving people's gait and posture performance; they have been used in different environments and are well accepted by users. In the PASSO project, we designed and developed a wearable device and a related system to transmit vibrations to a person's body to improve posture and combat impairments like Pisa syndrome and camptocormia. Specifically, this paper describes the methodologies and strategies used to design, develop, and test wearable prototypes and the mHealth system. The results allowed a multidisciplinary comparison among the solutions, which led to prototypes with a high degree of usability, wearability, accessibility, and effectiveness. This mHealth system is now being used in pilot trials with subjects with Parkinson's disease to verify its feasibility among patients.",0

      As effective interventions to prevent inpatient falls are lacking, a novel technological intervention was trialed. The Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM) system used wearable sensors that detected and alerted staff of patient movements requiring supervision. While the system did not reduce falls rate, it is important to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and safety of the AmbIGeM system, from the perspectives of patients and informal carers.

      We conducted a mixed-methods study using semistructured interviews, a pre-survey and post-survey. The AmbIGeM clinical trial was conducted in two geriatric evaluation and management units and a general medical ward, in two Australian hospitals, and a subset of participants were recruited. Within 3 days of being admitted to the study wards and enrolling in the trial, 31 participants completed the pre-survey. Prior to discharge (post-intervention), 30 participants completed the post-survey and 27 participants were interviewed. Interview data were thematically analyzed and survey data were descriptively analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Survey and interview participants had an average age of 83 (SD 9) years, 65% were female, and 41% were admitted with a fall. Participants considered the AmbIGeM system a good idea. Most but not all thought the singlet and sensor component as acceptable and comfortable, with no privacy concerns. Participants felt reassured with extra monitoring, although sometimes misunderstood the purpose of AmbIGeM as detecting patient falls. Participants' acceptability was strongly positive, with median 8+ (0-10 scale) on pre- and post-surveys.
    


          Discussion/conclusion:
        
      
      Patients' acceptability is important to optimize outcomes. Overall older patients considered the AmbIGeM system as acceptable, usable, and improving safety. The findings will be important to guide refinement of this and other similar technology developments.",8
490,"Development of a metric to evaluate the ergonomic principles of assistive systems, based on the DIN 92419","The DIN 92419 defines six principles for assistive systems' ergonomic design. There is, however, a lack of measurement tools to evaluate assistive systems considering these principles. Consequently, this study developed a measurement tool for the quantitative evaluation of the fulfilment of each principle for assistive systems. A systematic literature review was performed to identify dimensions belonging to the principles, identify how previous research evaluated these dimensions, and develop a measurement tool for assistive systems. Findings show that scales commonly used for evaluating assistive systems disregard several aspects highlighted as relevant by research, implying the need for considering the DIN 92419 principles. Based on established scales and theoretical findings, a questionnaire, and a checklist for evaluating assistive systems were developed. The work provides a grounding for measuring relevant aspects of assistive systems. Further development is needed to substantiate the reliability and validity of the proposed questionnaire scales and items. Practitioner Summary: Responding to the gap of a holistic measurement tool to evaluate assistive systems, a systematic literature review was performed considering the DIN 92419 principles. This resulted in a comprehensive summary of relevant aspects of assistive systems that were made numerically measurable, which proposes better criteria to assess assistive systems.

491,"Trainer in a pocket - proof-of-concept of mobile, real-time, foot kinematics feedback for gait pattern normalization in individuals after stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury and elderly patients","Background:
        
      
      Walking disabilities negatively affect inclusion in society and quality of life and increase the risk for secondary complications. It has been shown that external feedback applied by therapists and/or robotic training devices enables individuals with gait abnormalities to consciously normalize their gait pattern. However, little is known about the effects of a technically-assisted over ground feedback therapy. The aim of this study was to assess whether automatic real-time feedback provided by a shoe-mounted inertial-sensor-based gait therapy system is feasible in individuals with gait impairments after incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), stroke and in the elderly.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a non-controlled proof-of-concept study, feedback by tablet computer-generated verbalized instructions was given to individuals with iSCI, stroke and old age for normalization of an individually selected gait parameter (stride length, stance or swing duration, or foot-to-ground angle). The training phase consisted of 3 consecutive visits. Four weeks post training a follow-up visit was performed. Visits started with an initial gait analysis (iGA) without feedback, followed by 5 feedback training sessions of 2-3 min and a gait analysis at the end. A universal evaluation and FB scheme based on equidistant levels of deviations from the mean normal value (1 level = 1 standard deviation (SD) of the physiological reference for the feedback parameter) was used for assessment of gait quality as well as for automated adaptation of training difficulty. Overall changes in level over iGAs were detected using a Friedman's Test. Post-hoc testing was achieved with paired Wilcoxon Tests. The users' satisfaction was assessed by a customized questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen individuals with iSCI, 11 after stroke and 15 elderly completed the training. The average level at iGA significantly decreased over the visits in all groups (Friedman's test, p < 0.0001), with the biggest decrease between the first and second training visit (4.78 ± 2.84 to 3.02 ± 2.43, p < 0.0001, paired Wilcoxon test). Overall, users rated the system's usability and its therapeutic effect as positive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Mobile, real-time, verbalized feedback is feasible and results in a normalization of the feedback gait parameter. The results form a first basis for using real-time feedback in task-specific motor rehabilitation programs.

492,A Mass-Producible Washable Smart Garment with Embedded Textile EMG Electrodes for Control of Myoelectric Prostheses: A Pilot Study,"Electromyography (EMG) is the resulting electrical signal from muscle activity, commonly used as a proxy for users' intent in voluntary control of prosthetic devices. EMG signals are recorded with gold standard Ag/AgCl gel electrodes, though there are limitations in continuous use applications, with potential skin irritations and discomfort. Alternative dry solid metallic electrodes also face long-term usability and comfort challenges due to their inflexible and non-breathable structures. This is critical when the anatomy of the targeted body region is variable (e.g., residual limbs of individuals with amputation), and conformal contact is essential. In this study, textile electrodes were developed, and their performance in recording EMG signals was compared to gel electrodes. Additionally, to assess the reusability and robustness of the textile electrodes, the effect of 30 consumer washes was investigated. Comparisons were made between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with no statistically significant difference, and with the power spectral density (PSD), showing a high correlation. Subsequently, a fully textile sleeve was fabricated covering the forearm, with 14 textile electrodes. For three individuals, an artificial neural network model was trained, capturing the EMG of 7 distinct finger movements. The personalized models were then used to successfully control a myoelectric prosthetic hand.",0
493,"Measurement System for Unsupervised Standardized Assessment of Timed ""Up & Go"" and Five Times Sit to Stand Test in the Community-A Validity Study","Comprehensive and repetitive assessments are needed to detect physical changes in an older population to prevent functional decline at the earliest possible stage and to initiate preventive interventions. Established instruments like the Timed ""Up & Go"" (TUG) Test and the Sit-to-Stand Test (SST) require a trained person (e.g., physiotherapist) to assess physical performance. More often, these tests are only applied to a selected group of persons already functionally impaired and not to those who are at potential risk of functional decline. The article introduces the Unsupervised Screening System (USS) for unsupervised self-assessments by older adults and evaluates its validity for the TUG and SST. The USS included ambient and wearable movement sensors to measure the user's test performance. Sensor datasets of the USS's light barriers and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) were analyzed for 91 users aged 73 to 89 years compared to conventional stopwatch measurement. A significant correlation coefficient of 0.89 for the TUG test and of 0.73 for the SST were confirmed among USS's light barriers. Correspondingly, for the inertial data-based measures, a high and significant correlation of 0.78 for the TUG test and of 0.87 for SST were also found. The USS was a validated and reliable tool to assess TUG and SST.",5
494,The ATEAM study: Advances in technology to enhance PrEP adherence monitoring (ATEAM) among young men who have sex with men,"Young age has consistently correlated with lower adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Digital medicine, a dynamic healthcare platform of wearable physiological sensors and mobile communication technology that can respond to medication nonadherence rapidly, has the potential in promoting PrEP adherence. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of Proteus Discover, a digital monitoring adherence system, to measure PrEP adherence and provide real-time feedback among cisgender YMSM and transgender women. One hundred HIV-negative young men and transgender women ages 16-24 years were enrolled in a 24-week randomized controlled crossover study to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) coencapsulated with Proteus Discover versus TDF/FTC standard-of-care. Participants in the 12-week Proteus Discover arm received weekly SMS text messages to promote pill taking based on Proteus Discover adherence data. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected at 4-week intervals for tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in red blood cells as the referent and questionnaires were completed to assess acceptability, usability, and patterns of use. Linear mixed models analyzed the relationship between 30-day adherence measured by DBS and Proteus Discover. PrEP adherence was high overall. Adherence, as measured by DBS, was correlated with adherence as measured by Proteus Discover (p value = 0.03). Most participants reported that Proteus Discover helped them take their PrEP daily and that the system was easy to use. However, a majority (53.5%-60.5%) disagreed with the statement that wearing the patch was not an issue. There was an incremental increase in TFV-DP in DBS with adherence by Proteus Discover. More research is warranted to explore optimizing PrEP adherence for youth through real-time monitoring.",8
495,"Preliminary Study on a Novel Protocol for Improving Familiarity with a Lower-Limb Robotic Exoskeleton in Able-Bodied, First-Time Users","Lower-limb exoskeletons have been created for different healthcare needs, but no research has been done on developing a proper protocol for users to get accustomed to moving with one. The user manuals provided also do not include such instructions. A pre-test was conducted with the TWIN (IIT), which is a lower-limb exoskeleton made for persons with spinal cord injury. In the pre-test, two healthy, able-bodied graduate students indicated a need for a protocol that can better prepare able-bodied, first-time users to move with an exoskeleton. TWIN was used in this preliminary study and nine users were divided to receive a tutorial or no tutorial before walking with the exoskeleton. Due to COVID-19 regulations, the study could only be performed with healthy, young-to-middle-aged lab members that do not require walking support. The proposed protocol was evaluated with the System Usability Scale, NASA Raw Task Load Index, and two custom surveys. The members who received the tutorial found it easy to follow and helpful, but the tutorial seemed to come at a price of higher perceived mental and physical demands, which could stem from the longer testing duration and the need to constantly recall and apply the things learned from the tutorial. All results presented are preliminary, and it is recommended to include biomechanical analysis and conduct the experiment with more participants in the future. Nonetheless, this proof-of-concept study lays groundwork for future related studies and the protocol will be adjusted, applied, and validated to patients and geriatric users.",3
496,A telehealth system for Parkinson's disease remote monitoring. The PERFORM approach,This paper summarizes the experience and the lessons learned from the European project PERFORM (A sophisticated multi-parametric system FOR the continuous effective assessment and monitoring of motor status in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases). PERFORM is aimed to provide a telehealth system for the remote monitoring of Parkinson's disease patients (PD) at their homes. This paper explains the global experience with PERFORM. It summarizes the technical performance of the system and the feedback received from the patients in terms of usability and wearability.,7
497,M-BRIDGE: Wireless portable onbody aggregator and visualizer system for Wireless Body Sensor Network,"Advances made in electronics, intelligent and wireless technologies enable individuals to self-observe their health states anywhere anytime. The shift in self care becomes a promising paradigm to alleviate burdens on centralized institutional care. As a result, Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) personal health solutions can be seen increasingly although medical community still has concerns on their usability and applicability. Especially, there is still lacking in portable wireless wearable gateway to integrate WBSN into existing healthcare solutions. To fulfill this gap, we design and develop MobilE on-Body aGgregator and vIsualizer Device (M-BRIDGE) system using Android smart phone. Our proposed solution fully supports the needs of flexible device interfacing, data aggregation, efficient data distribution and user-friendly visualization. We also explain how M-BRIDGE's unique features and operation can complement with and fulfill the deficiency of existing WBSN healthcare solutions. We finally present the details of implementation and technical evaluation as well as discussion on the potential issues and future works.",2
498,Prototype Development of a Responsive Emotive Sensing System (DRESS) to aid older persons with dementia to dress independently,"Background:
        
      
      Prior research has critiqued the lack of attention to the stressors associated with dementia related dressing issues, stigmatizing patient clothing, and wearable technology challenges. This paper describes the conceptual development and feasibility testing of an innovative 'smart dresser' context aware affective system (DRESS) to enable dressing by people with moderate memory loss through individualized audio and visual task prompting in real time.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Mixed method feasibility study involving qualitative focus groups with 25 Alzheimer's family caregivers experiencing dressing difficulties to iteratively inform system design and a quantitative usability trial with 10 healthy subjects in a controlled laboratory setting to assess validity of technical operations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Caregivers voiced the need for tangible dressing assistance to reduce their frustration from time spent in repetitive cueing and power struggles over dressing. They contributed 6 changes that influenced the prototype development, most notably adding a dresser top iPad to mimic a familiar 'TV screen' for the audio and visual cueing. DRESS demonstrated promising overall functionality, however the validity of identification of dressing status ranged from 0% for the correct pants dressing to 100% for all shirts dressing scenarios. Adjustments were made to the detection components of the system raising the accuracy of detection of all acted dressing scenarios for pants from 50% to 82%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Findings demonstrate family caregiver acceptability of the proposed system, the successful interoperability of the built system's components, and the system's ability to interpret correct and incorrect dressing actions in controlled laboratory simulations. Future research will advance the system to the alpha stage and subsequent testing with end users in real world settings.",3
499,Expert appraisal and prioritization of barriers to mHealth use for older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias: A Delphi study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Older adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can benefit from mHealth innovations in (daily) care. However, successful implementation and adoption of such innovations can be hindered by a lack of inclusive design. Inclusive design can be challenging, due to the variety of ADRD- and aging-related symptoms that can pose barriers to using mHealth. Previously, a literature-based model with 53 barriers to mHealth use for this population has been developed (""MHealth for OLder adults living with DEMentia - USability"" or MOLDEM-US). In this study, we aim to prioritize these through a Delphi study with ADRD experts (case managers, informal caregivers, hospital healthcare professionals, district nurses, and researchers).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In the first round, participant characteristics and potentially new insights into barriers to mHealth use for older adults living with ADRD were gathered. The consensus questionnaire was submitted in the second round, containing barriers to mHealth use for this population (from MOLDEM-US) with questions inquiring its impact and frequency. In the third round, participants rejudged those barriers for which no consensus (<51 %) or minor consensus (51 % - 60 %) was reached.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-seven participants completed the three rounds of the study. Consensus was reached for eleven barriers after the second round, all having major impact and frequency: integration of functions during daily activities, perceived complexity, efficiency in seeing benefits, trust in own ability, restlessness and agitation, computer literacy, self confidence in using wearables, learnability, working memory, and visual acuity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      After round three, consensus was achieved for all 53 barriers. Twenty-six barriers are considered to majorly affect mHealth use, most of which relate to cognition and frame of mind. This study contributes to the development of mHealth design guidelines that take into account the progressive and diverse ADRD- and aging-related symptoms negatively affecting mHealth implementation and adoption.",2
500,The Effects of an Individualized Smartphone-Based Exercise Program on Self-defined Motor Tasks in Parkinson Disease: Pilot Interventional Study,"Background:
        
      
      Bradykinesia and rigidity are prototypical motor impairments of Parkinson disease (PD) highly influencing everyday life. Exercise training is an effective treatment alternative for motor symptoms, complementing dopaminergic medication. High frequency training is necessary to yield clinically relevant improvements. Exercise programs need to be tailored to individual symptoms and integrated in patients' everyday life. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, exercise groups in outpatient setting were largely reduced. Developing remotely supervised solutions is therefore of significant importance.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a digital, home-based, high-frequency exercise program for patients with PD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this pilot interventional study, patients diagnosed with PD received 4 weeks of personalized exercise at home using a smartphone app, remotely supervised by specialized therapists. Exercises were chosen based on the patient-defined motor impairment and depending on the patients' individual capacity (therapists defined 3-5 short training sequences for each participant). In a first education session, the tailored exercise program was explained and demonstrated to each participant and they were thoroughly introduced to the smartphone app. Intervention effects were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, part III; standardized sensor-based gait analysis; Timed Up and Go Test; 2-minute walk test; quality of life assessed by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire; and patient-defined motor tasks of daily living. Usability of the smartphone app was assessed by the System Usability Scale. All participants gave written informed consent before initiation of the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 15 individuals with PD completed the intervention phase without any withdrawals or dropouts. The System Usability Scale reached an average score of 72.2 (SD 6.5) indicating good usability of the smartphone app. Patient-defined motor tasks of daily living significantly improved by 40% on average in 87% (13/15) of the patients. There was no significant impact on the quality of life as assessed by the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (but the subsections regarding mobility and social support improved by 14% from 25 to 21 and 19% from 15 to 13, respectively). Motor symptoms rated by Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, part III, did not improve significantly but a descriptive improvement of 14% from 18 to 16 could be observed. Clinically relevant changes in Timed Up and Go test, 2-minute walk test, and sensor-based gait parameters or functional gait tests were not observed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This pilot interventional study presented that a tailored, digital, home-based, and high-frequency exercise program over 4 weeks was feasible and improved patient-defined motor activities of daily life based on a self-developed patient-defined impairment score indicating that digital exercise concepts may have the potential to beneficially impact motor symptoms of daily living. Future studies should investigate sustainability effects in controlled study designs conducted over a longer period.",8
501,"A Technological-Based Platform for Risk Assessment, Detection, and Prevention of Falls Among Home-Dwelling Older Adults: Protocol for a Quasi-Experimental Study","Background:
        
      
      According to the United Nations, it is estimated that by 2050, the number of people aged 80 years and older will have increased by 3 times. Increased longevity is often accompanied by structural and functional changes that occur throughout an individual's lifespan. These changes are often aggravated by chronic comorbidities, adopted behaviors or lifestyles, and environmental exposure, among other factors. Some of the related outcomes are loss of muscle strength, decreased balance control, and mobility impairments, which are strongly associated with the occurrence of falls in the elderly. Despite the continued undervaluation of the importance of knowledge on fall prevention among the elderly population by primary care health professionals, several evidence-based (single or multifaceted) fall prevention programs such as the Otago Exercise Program (OEP) have demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of falls and fall-related injuries in the elderly within community settings. Recent studies have strived to integrate technology into physical exercise programs, which is effective for adherence and overcoming barriers to exercise, as well as improving physical functioning.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to assess the impact of the OEP on the functionality of home-dwelling elderly using a common technological platform. Particularly, the impact on muscle strength, balance, mobility, risk of falling, the perception of fear of falling, and the perception of the elderly regarding the ease of use of technology are being examined in this study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A quasi-experimental study (before and after; single group) will be conducted with male and female participants aged 65 years or older living at home in the district of Porto. Participants will be recruited through the network COLABORAR, with a minimum of 30 participants meeting the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. All participants will sign informed consent forms. The data collection instrument consists of sociodemographic and clinical variables (self-reported), functional evaluation variables, and environmental risk variables. The data collection tool integrates primary and secondary outcome variables. The primary outcome is gait (timed-up and go test; normal step). The secondary outcome variables are lower limb strength and muscle resistance (30-second chair stand test), balance (4-stage balance test), frequency of falls, functional capacity (Lawton and Brody - Portuguese version), fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale International - Portuguese version), usability of the technology (System Usability Scale - Portuguese version), and environmental risk variables (home fall prevention checklist for older adults). Technological solutions, such as the FallSensing Home application and Kallisto wearable device, will be used, which will allow the detection and prevention of falls. The intervention is characterized by conducting the OEP through a common technological platform 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Throughout these weeks, the participants will be followed up in person or by telephone contact by the rehabilitation nurse. Considering the COVID-19 outbreak, all guidelines from the National Health Service will be followed. The project was funded by InnoStars, in collaboration with the Local EIT Health Regional Innovation Scheme Hub of the University of Porto.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study was approved on October 9, 2020 by the Ethics Committee of Escola Superior de Enfermagem do Porto (ESEP). The recruitment process was meant to start in October, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was suspended. We expect to restart the study by the beginning of the third quarter of 2021.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings of this study protocol will contribute to the design and development of future robust studies for technological tests in a clinical context.

502,Mobile therapeutic attention for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (m-RESIST): a prospective multicentre feasibility study protocol in patients and their caregivers,"Introduction:
        
      
      Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is a severe form of schizophrenia. In the European Union, approximately 40% of people with schizophrenia have TRS. Factors such as the persistence of positive symptoms or higher risk of comorbidities leave clinicians with a complex scenario when treating these patients. Intervention strategies based on mHealth have demonstrated their ability to support and promote self-management-based strategies. Mobile therapeutic attention for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (m-RESIST), an innovative mHealth solution based on novel technology and offering high modular and flexible functioning, has been developed specifically for patients with TRS and their caregivers. As intervention in TRS is a challenge, it is necessary to perform a feasibility study before the cost-effectiveness testing stage.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      This manuscript describes the protocol for a prospective multicentre feasibility study in 45 patients with TRS and their caregivers who will be attended in the public health system of three localities: Hospital Santa Creu Sant Pau (Spain), Semmelweis University (Hungary) and Gertner Institute & Sheba Medical Center (Israel). The primary aim is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the m-RESIST solution, configured by three mHealth tools: an app, wearable and a web-based platform. The solution collects data about acceptability, usability and satisfaction, together with preliminary data on perceived quality of life, symptoms and economic variables. The secondary aim is to collect preliminary data on perceived quality of life, symptoms and economic variables.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      This study protocol, funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Union, has the approval of the ethics committees of the participating institutions. Participants will be fully informed of the purpose and procedures of the study, and signed inform consents will be obtained. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in scientific conferences to ensure widespread dissemination.

503,Perception Accuracy of a Multi-Channel Tactile Feedback System for Assistive Technology,"Assistive technology uses multi-modal feedback devices, focusing on the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities. Tactile devices provide additional information via touch sense. Perception accuracy of vibrations depends on the spectral and temporal attributes of the signal, as well as on the body parts they are attached to. The widespread use of AR/VR devices, wearables, and gaming interfaces requires information about the usability of feedback devices. This paper presents results of an experiment using an 8-channel tactile feedback system with vibrators placed on the wrists, arms, ankles, and forehead. Different vibration patterns were designed and presented using sinusoidal frequency bursts on 2, 4, and 8 channels. In total, 27 subjects reported their sensation formally and informally on questionnaires. Results indicate that 2 and 4 channels could be used simultaneously with high accuracy, and the transducers' optimal placement (best sensitivity) is on the wrists, followed by the ankles. Arm and head positions were inferior and generally inadequate for signal presentation. For optimal performance, signal length should exceed 500 ms. Furthermore, the amplitude level and temporal pattern of the presented signals have to be used for carrying information rather than the frequency of the vibration.",7
504,Design and Development of a Digital Weight Management Intervention (ToDAy): Qualitative Study,"Background:
        
      
      The Tailored Diet and Activity (ToDAy) study aims to build on the campaign by adding a digital intervention with the potential to provide wide-reaching, cost-effective weight management support.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The ToDAy study aims to build a tailored intervention using mobile technology to improve diet and physical activity behaviours in adults with overweight and obesity. The main objectives were to identify behavior change techniques for diet and physical activity (PA) change for weight loss and explore preferences for digital intervention features that would be effective in changing diet and PA behaviors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This qualitative study uses the principles of a person-based approach to intervention development; the behavioral intervention technology framework; and the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) framework. Focus groups and telephone interviews were conducted with 56 adults in Western Australia. Open-ended questions and example intervention features were used to explore the usability and acceptability of the self-monitoring tools, knowledge about effective weight-loss strategies, and acceptability of tailored feedback. Findings from the focus groups and interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Qualitative findings revealed an awareness of key public health messages but a lack of confidence in how to perform these behaviors to help manage their weight. A total of 4 major themes were identified and mapped to the domains of the COM-B framework: (1) misinformation, (2) environmental support, (3) social norms, and (4) confidence.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study explores users' capability, opportunity, and motivation to perform the target behaviors for weight loss. The findings suggested that a digital weight management intervention using a mobile food record and activity trackers to inform tailored feedback may be acceptable and feasible. Participants expressed a preference for simple expert advice, digital self-monitoring tools, and visual feedback.

505,The potential use of digital health technologies in the African context: a systematic review of evidence from Ethiopia,"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently put forth a Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025 with several countries having already achieved key milestones. We aimed to understand whether and how digital health technologies (DHTs) are absorbed in Africa, tracking Ethiopia as a key node. We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to 02 February 2021 for studies of any design that investigated the potential of DHTs in clinical or public health practices in Ethiopia. This review was registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42021240645 ) and it was designed to inform our ongoing DHT-enabled randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04216420 ). We found 27,493 potentially relevant citations, among which 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 596,128 patients, healthy individuals, and healthcare professionals. The studies involved six DHTs: mHealth (29 studies, 574,649 participants); electronic health records (13 studies, 4534 participants); telemedicine (4 studies, 465 participants); cloud-based application (2 studies, 2382 participants); information communication technology (3 studies, 681 participants), and artificial intelligence (1 study, 13,417 participants). The studies targeted six health conditions: maternal and child health (15), infectious diseases (14), non-communicable diseases (3), dermatitis (1), surgery (4), and general health conditions (15). The outcomes of interest were feasibility, usability, willingness or readiness, effectiveness, quality improvement, and knowledge or attitude toward DHTs. Five studies involved RCTs. The analysis showed that although DHTs are a relatively recent phenomenon in Ethiopia, their potential harnessing clinical and public health practices are highly visible. Their adoption and implementation in full capacity require more training, access to better devices such as smartphones, and infrastructure. DHTs hold much promise tackling major clinical and public health backlogs and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem in Ethiopia. More RCTs are needed on emerging DHTs including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, cybersecurity, telemedicine, and wearable devices to provide robust evidence of their potential use in such settings and to materialize the WHO's Global Strategy on Digital Health.",2
506,Device- and system-independent personal touchless user interface for operating rooms : One personal UI to control all displays in an operating room,"Introduction:
        
      
      In the modern day operating room, the surgeon performs surgeries with the support of different medical systems that showcase patient information, physiological data, and medical images. It is generally accepted that numerous interactions must be performed by the surgical team to control the corresponding medical system to retrieve the desired information. Joysticks and physical keys are still present in the operating room due to the disadvantages of mouses, and surgeons often communicate instructions to the surgical team when requiring information from a specific medical system. In this paper, a novel user interface is developed that allows the surgeon to personally perform touchless interaction with the various medical systems, switch effortlessly among them, all of this without modifying the systems' software and hardware.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To achieve this, a wearable RGB-D sensor is mounted on the surgeon's head for inside-out tracking of his/her finger with any of the medical systems' displays. Android devices with a special application are connected to the computers on which the medical systems are running, simulating a normal USB mouse and keyboard. When the surgeon performs interaction using pointing gestures, the desired cursor position in the targeted medical system display, and gestures, are transformed into general events and then sent to the corresponding Android device. Finally, the application running on the Android devices generates the corresponding mouse or keyboard events according to the targeted medical system.
    


          Results and conclusion:
        
      
      To simulate an operating room setting, our unique user interface was tested by seven medical participants who performed several interactions with the visualization of CT, MRI, and fluoroscopy images at varying distances from them. Results from the system usability scale and NASA-TLX workload index indicated a strong acceptance of our proposed user interface.",4
507,Noninvasive mobile EEG as a tool for seizure monitoring and management: A systematic review,"In the last two decades new noninvasive mobile electroencephalography (EEG) solutions have been developed to overcome limitations of conventional clinical EEG and to improve monitoring of patients with long-term conditions. Despite the availability of mobile innovations, their adoption is still very limited. The aim of this study is to review the current state-of-the-art and highlight the main advantages of adopting noninvasive mobile EEG solutions in clinical trials and research studies of people with epilepsy or suspected seizures. Device characteristics are described, and their evaluation is presented. Two authors independently performed a literature review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A combination of different digital libraries was used (Embase, MEDLINE, Global Health, PsycINFO and https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Twenty-three full-text, six conference abstracts, and eight webpages were included, where a total of 14 noninvasive mobile solutions were identified. Published studies demonstrated at different levels how EEG recorded via mobile EEG can be used for visual detection of EEG abnormalities and for the application of automatic-detection algorithms with acceptable specificity and sensitivity. When the quality of the signal was compared with scalp EEG, many similarities were found in the background activities and power spectrum. Several studies indicated that the experience of patients and health care providers using mobile EEG was positive in different settings. Ongoing trials are focused mostly on improving seizure-detection accuracy and also on testing and assessing feasibility and acceptability of noninvasive devices in the hospital and at home. This review supports the potential clinical value of noninvasive mobile EEG systems and their advantages in terms of time, technical support, cost, usability, and reliability when applied to seizure detection and management. On the other hand, the limitations of the studies confirmed that future research is needed to provide more evidence regarding feasibility and acceptability in different settings, as well as the data quality and detection accuracy of new noninvasive mobile EEG solutions.",1
508,"Intraoperative monitoring of neuromuscular function with soft, skin-mounted wireless devices","Peripheral nerves are often vulnerable to damage during surgeries, with risks of significant pain, loss of motor function, and reduced quality of life for the patient. Intraoperative methods for monitoring nerve activity are effective, but conventional systems rely on bench-top data acquisition tools with hard-wired connections to electrode leads that must be placed percutaneously inside target muscle tissue. These approaches are time and skill intensive and therefore costly to an extent that precludes their use in many important scenarios. Here we report a soft, skin-mounted monitoring system that measures, stores, and wirelessly transmits electrical signals and physical movement associated with muscle activity, continuously and in real-time during neurosurgical procedures on the peripheral, spinal, and cranial nerves. Surface electromyography and motion measurements can be performed non-invasively in this manner on nearly any muscle location, thereby offering many important advantages in usability and cost, with signal fidelity that matches that of the current clinical standard of care for decision making. These results could significantly improve accessibility of intraoperative monitoring across a broad range of neurosurgical procedures, with associated enhancements in patient outcomes.",0
509,Lighter and Simpler Design Paradigm for Widespread Use of Ankle Exosuits Based on Bio-Inspired Patterns,"Soft wearable robots are attracting immense attention owing to their high usability and wearability. In particular, studies on soft exosuits have achieved remarkable progress. Walking is one of the most basic human actions in daily life. During walking, the ankle joint has considerable influence. Therefore, an exosuit design paradigm having a light and simple structure was developed with the goal of fabricating a soft exosuit that supports the ankle. The new exosuit matches the performance of existing exosuits while being as comfortable as everyday wear. A walking test through a combination with a mobile actuator system, which can maximize these advantages, was also conducted. The combination with the mobile system demonstrates the potential of using the new ankle exosuit as inner wear that maximizes the advantages of a lighter and simpler design. The exosuit design paradigm could serve as an effective guideline for manufacturing assistive exosuits for various body parts in the future.",0
510,An On-Skin Electrode with Anti-Epidermal-Surface-Lipid Function Based on a Zwitterionic Polymer Brush,"On-skin flexible devices provide a noninvasive approach for continuous and real-time acquisition of biological signals from the skin, which is essential for future chronic disease diagnosis and smart health monitoring. Great progress has been achieved in flexible devices to resolve the mechanical mismatching between conventional rigid devices and human skin. However, common materials used for flexible devices including silicon-based elastomers and various metals exhibit no resistance to epidermal surface lipids (skin oil and grease), which restricts the long-term and household usability. Herein, an on-skin electrode with anti-epidermal-surface-lipid function is reported, which is based on the grafting of a zwitterionic poly(2-methacryl-oyloxyethyl, methacryloyl-oxyethyl, or meth-acryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) brush on top of gold-coated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (Au/PDMS). Such an electrode allows the skin-lipids-fouled surface to be cleaned by simple water rinsing owing to the superhydrophilic zwitterionic groups. As a proof-of-concept, the PMPC-Au/PDMS electrodes are employed for both electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) recording. The electrodes are able to maintain stable skin-electrode impedance and good signal-to noise ratio (SNR) by water rinsing alone. This work provides a material-based solution to improve the long-term reusability of on-skin electronics and offers a unique prospective on developing next generation wearable healthcare devices.",0
511,Perceived Need and Acceptability of an App to Support Activities of Daily Living in People With Cognitive Impairment and Their Carers: Pilot Survey Study,"Background:
        
      
      Modern technologies, including smartphone apps, have the potential to assist people with cognitive impairment with activities of daily living, allowing them to maintain their independence and reduce carer burden. However, such tools have seen a slow rate of uptake in this population, and data on the acceptability of assistive technologies in this population are limited.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This pilot study included older adults with cognitive impairment and their carers, and explored the perceived needs for and acceptability of an app that was designed to be a simple assistive tool for activities of daily living. In particular, this study aimed to assess the acceptability of common app functions such as communication, reminder, navigation, and emergency tools in this population, and to compare patients' and carers' responses to them.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 24 German participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and their family carers separately completed two short questionnaires. The first questionnaire asked the participants with cognitive impairment and their carers to self-rate the patients' cognitive impairment levels and affinity to technology. Following a demonstration of the app, participants rated the usability and acceptability of the app and its functions in a second questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants rated themselves as much less cognitively impaired than their carers did (P=.01), and insight into the level of support they received was low. The majority of the participants (19/24, 79%) and their carers (20/24, 83%) had low affinity to technology, and even after the demonstration, 63% (15/24) of the participants had low interest in using the app. A breakdown of acceptability responses by app function revealed that participants were more amenable to the reminder function, the emergency feature, and a wearable form of the app. Features that centered around carers monitoring participants' movements were reported to be less acceptable to participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study highlights the importance of focusing on acceptability and the consumer's perceptions in the development of assistive technology for older adults with cognitive impairment. Participants showed an aversion to functions they perceived as eroding their independence, while functions that more closely aligned with independence and autonomy were perceived as more acceptable.",1
512,"Self-monitoring practices, attitudes, and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder: implications for the design of technologies to manage mental health","Objective:
        
      
      To understand self-monitoring strategies used independently of clinical treatment by individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), in order to recommend technology design principles to support mental health management.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Participants with BD (N = 552) were recruited through the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the International Bipolar Foundation, and WeSearchTogether.org to complete a survey of closed- and open-ended questions. In this study, we focus on descriptive results and qualitative analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Individuals reported primarily self-monitoring items related to their bipolar disorder (mood, sleep, finances, exercise, and social interactions), with an increasing trend towards the use of digital tracking methods observed. Most participants reported having positive experiences with technology-based tracking because it enables self-reflection and agency regarding health management and also enhances lines of communication with treatment teams. Reported challenges stem from poor usability or difficulty interpreting self-tracked data.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Two major implications for technology-based self-monitoring emerged from our results. First, technologies can be designed to be more condition-oriented, intuitive, and proactive. Second, more automated forms of digital symptom tracking and intervention are desired, and our results suggest the feasibility of detecting and predicting emotional states from patterns of technology usage. However, we also uncovered tension points, namely that technology designed to support mental health can also be a disruptor.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study provides increased understanding of self-monitoring practices, attitudes, and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder. This knowledge bears implications for clinical researchers and practitioners seeking insight into how individuals independently self-manage their condition as well as for researchers designing monitoring technologies to support mental health management.",4
513,Image complexity analysis with scanpath identification using remote gaze estimation model,"Analysis of gaze points has been a vital tool for understanding varied human behavioral pattern and underlying psychological processing. Gaze points are analyzed generally in terms of two events of fixations and saccades that are collectively termed as scanpath. Scanpath could potentially establish correlation between visual scenery and human cognitive tendencies. Scanpath has been analyzed for different domains that include visual perception, usability, memory, visual search or low level attributes like color, illumination and edges in an image. Visual search is one prominent area that examines scanpath of subjects while a target object is searched in a given set of images. Visual search explores behavioral tendencies of subjects with respect to image complexity. Complexity of an image is governed by spatial, frequency and color information present in the image. Scanpath based image complexity analysis determines human visual behavior that could lead to development of interactive and intelligent systems. There are several sophisticated eye tracking devices and associated algorithms for recording and classification of scanpath. However, in the present scenario when the chances of viral infections (COVID-19) from known and unknown sources are high, it is very important that the contact less methods and models be designed. In addition, even though the devices acquire and process eye movement data with fair accuracy but are intrusive and costly. The objective of current research work is to establish the complexity of the given set of images while target objects are searched and to present analysis of gaze search pattern. To achieve these objectives a remote gaze estimation and analysis model has been proposed for scanpath identification and analysis. The model is an alternate option for gaze point tracking and scanpath analysis that is non intrusive and low cost. The gaze points are tracked remotely as against sophisticated wearable eye tracking devices available in the market. The model employs easily available softwares and hardware devices. In the current work, complexity is derived on the basis of analysis of fixation and saccade gaze points. Based on the results generated by the proposed model, influence on subjects due to external stimuli is studied. The set of images chosen, act as external stimuli for the subjects during visual search. In order to statistically analyze scanpath for different subjects, certain scanpath parameters have been identified. The model maps and classifies eye movement gaze points into fixations and saccades and generates data for identified parameters. For eye detection and subsequent iris detection voila jones and circular hough transform (CHT) algorithms have been used. Identification by dispersion threshold (I-DT) is implemented for scanpath identification. The algorithms are customized for better iris and scanpath detection. Algorithms are developed for gaze screen mapping and classification of fixations and saccades. The experimentation has been carried on different subjects. Variations during visual search have been observed and analyzed. The present model requires no contact of human subject with any equipment including eye tracking devices, screen or computing devices.",3
514,Re-Enactment as a Method to Reproduce Real-World Fall Events Using Inertial Sensor Data: Development and Usability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Falls are a common health problem, which in the worst cases can lead to death. To develop reliable fall detection algorithms as well as suitable prevention interventions, it is important to understand circumstances and characteristics of real-world fall events. Although falls are common, they are seldom observed, and reports are often biased. Wearable inertial sensors provide an objective approach to capture real-world fall signals. However, it is difficult to directly derive visualization and interpretation of body movements from the fall signals, and corresponding video data is rarely available.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The re-enactment method uses available information from inertial sensors to simulate fall events, replicate the data, validate the simulation, and thereby enable a more precise description of the fall event. The aim of this paper is to describe this method and demonstrate the validity of the re-enactment approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Real-world fall data, measured by inertial sensors attached to the lower back, were selected from the Fall Repository for the Design of Smart and Self-Adaptive Environments Prolonging Independent Living (FARSEEING) database. We focused on well-described fall events such as stumbling to be re-enacted under safe conditions in a laboratory setting. For the purposes of exemplification, we selected the acceleration signal of one fall event to establish a detailed simulation protocol based on identified postures and trunk movement sequences. The subsequent re-enactment experiments were recorded with comparable inertial sensor configurations as well as synchronized video cameras to analyze the movement behavior in detail. The re-enacted sensor signals were then compared with the real-world signals to adapt the protocol and repeat the re-enactment method if necessary. The similarity between the simulated and the real-world fall signals was analyzed with a dynamic time warping algorithm, which enables the comparison of two temporal sequences varying in speed and timing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A fall example from the FARSEEING database was used to show the feasibility of producing a similar sensor signal with the re-enactment method. Although fall events were heterogeneous concerning chronological sequence and curve progression, it was possible to reproduce a good approximation of the motion of a person's center of mass during fall events based on the available sensor information.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Re-enactment is a promising method to understand and visualize the biomechanics of inertial sensor-recorded real-world falls when performed in a suitable setup, especially if video data is not available.",7
515,Exoskeleton use in post-stroke gait rehabilitation: a qualitative study of the perspectives of persons post-stroke and physiotherapists,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable powered exoskeletons are a new and emerging technology developed to provide sensory-guided motorized lower limb assistance enabling intensive task specific locomotor training utilizing typical lower limb movement patterns for persons with gait impairments. To ensure that devices meet end-user needs it is important to understand and incorporate end-users perspectives, however research in this area is extremely limited in the post-stroke population. The purpose of this study was to explore in-depth, end-users perspectives, persons with stroke and physiotherapists, following a single-use session with a H2 exoskeleton.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a qualitative interpretive description approach utilizing semi-structured face to face interviews, with persons post-stroke and physiotherapists, following a 1.5 h session with a H2 exoskeleton.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five persons post-stroke and 6 physiotherapists volunteered to participate in the study. Both participant groups provided insightful comments on their experience with the exoskeleton. Four themes were developed from the persons with stroke participant data: (1) Adopting technology; (2) Device concerns; (3) Developing walking ability; and, (4) Integrating exoskeleton use. Five themes were developed from the physiotherapist participant data: (1) Developer-user collaboration; (2) Device specific concerns; (3) Device programming; (4) Patient characteristics requiring consideration; and, (5) Indications for use.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study provides an interpretive understanding of end-users perspectives, persons with stroke and neurological physiotherapists, following a single-use experience with a H2 exoskeleton. The findings from both stakeholder groups overlap such that four over-arching concepts were identified including: (i) Stakeholder participation; (ii) Augmentation vs. autonomous robot; (iii) Exoskeleton usability; and (iv) Device specific concerns. The end users provided valuable perspectives on the use and design of the H2 exoskeleton, identifying needs specific to post-stroke gait rehabilitation, the need for a robust evidence base, whilst also highlighting that there is significant interest in this technology throughout the continuum of stroke rehabilitation.",3
516,"Benchmarking Wearable Robots: Challenges and Recommendations From Functional, User Experience, and Methodological Perspectives","Wearable robots (WRs) are increasingly moving out of the labs toward real-world applications. In order for WRs to be effectively and widely adopted by end-users, a common benchmarking framework needs to be established. In this article, we outline the perspectives that in our opinion are the main determinants of this endeavor, and exemplify the complex landscape into three areas. The first perspective is related to quantifying the technical performance of the device and the physical impact of the device on the user. The second one refers to the understanding of the user's perceptual, emotional, and cognitive experience of (and with) the technology. The third one proposes a strategic path for a global benchmarking methodology, composed by reproducible experimental procedures representing real-life conditions. We hope that this paper can enable developers, researchers, clinicians and end-users to efficiently identify the most promising directions for validating their technology and drive future research efforts in the short and medium term.",3
517,Human Factors and User Experience Issues with Ventricular Assist Device Wearable Components: A Systematic Review,"Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) provide continuous mechanical circulatory support during in- and out-of-hospital care. However, limitations of the external wearable components influence patient quality of life. There is insufficient understanding of the issues with such components that combines a holistic viewpoint from both human factors and user (including patient and caregiver) experience perspectives. This paper comprehensively details the issues with VAD wearable systems and proposes a way for human-centered design to bridge the gap, addressing such issues synergistically. Through the review the authors investigated: the user issues caused by wearable components of VADs, and how human factors issues correlate to the VAD user experience. A Boolean search (""ventricular assist"" AND ""human factors"" AND ""experience"") for peer-reviewed studies published between 2008 and 2018 returned 338 titles, with 35 relevant studies selected using a PRISMA process for inclusion in cross-study analysis and synthesis. This paper provides design recommendations for the issues found in the literature. Four key focus areas to inform the future design of VAD wearable components were identified-'Power Supply', 'Wearability and Travel Freedom', 'The Female Experience' and 'Intuitive Handling'. Using design to drive innovation could result in VAD wearable components which better meet or exceed users' quality of life goals.",3
518,Embedded Model Predictive Control for a Wearable Artificial Pancreas,"While artificial pancreas (AP) systems are expected to improve the quality of life among people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the design of convenient systems that optimize the user experience, especially for those with active lifestyles, such as children and adolescents, still remains an open research question. In this work, we introduce an embeddable design and implementation of model predictive control (MPC) of AP systems for people with T1DM that significantly reduces the weight and on-body footprint of the AP system. The embeddable controller is based on a zone MPC that has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies. The proposed embedded zone MPC features a simpler design of the periodic safe zone in the cost function and the utilization of state-of-the-art alternating minimization algorithms for solving the convex programming problems inherent to MPC with linear models subject to convex constraints. Off-line closed-loop data generated by the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova simulator is used to select an optimization algorithm and corresponding tuning parameters. Through hardware-in-the-loop in silico results on a limited-resource Arduino Zero (Feather M0) platform, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed embedded MPC. In spite of resource limitations, our embedded zone MPC manages to achieve comparable performance of that of the full-version zone MPC implemented in a 64-bit desktop for scenarios with/without meal-disturbance compensations. Metrics for performance comparison included median percent time in the euglycemic ([70, 180] mg/dL range) of 84.3% vs. 83.1% for announced meals, with an equivalence test yielding p = 0.0013 and 66.2% vs. 66.0% for unannounced meals with p = 0.0028.",0
519,Development of User-Friendly Wearable Electronic Textiles for Healthcare Applications,"This paper presents research into a user-friendly electronic sleeve (e-sleeve) with integrated electrodes in an array for wearable healthcare. The electrode array was directly printed onto an everyday clothing fabric using screen printing. The fabric properties and designed structures of the e-sleeve were assessed and refined through interaction with end users. Different electrode array layouts were fabricated to optimize the user experience in terms of comfort, effectivity and ease of use. The e-sleeve uses dry electrodes to facilitate ease of use and the electrode array can survive bending a sufficient number of times to ensure an acceptable usage lifetime. Different cleaning methods (washing and wiping) have been identified to enable reuse of the e-sleeve after contamination during use. The application of the e-sleeve has been demonstrated via muscle stimulation on the upper limb to achieve functional tasks (e.g., hand opening, pointing) for eight stroke survivors.",0
520,Manufacturing worker perceptions of using wearable inertial sensors for multiple work shifts,"Wearable inertial sensors may be used to objectively quantify exposure to some physical risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. However, concerns regarding their potential negative effects on user safety and satisfaction remain. This study characterized the self-reported daily discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing inertial sensors on the upper arms, trunk, and dominant wrist of 31 manufacturing workers collected over 15 full work shifts. Results indicated that the workers considered the devices as generally comfortable to wear, not distracting, and not burdensome to use. Exposure to non-neutral postures (discomfort, right arm, beta = 0.02; trunk, beta = -0.01), non-cyclic tasks (distraction, beta = -0.26), and higher body mass indices (discomfort, beta = 0.05; distraction, beta = 0.02) contributed to statistically significant (p < 0.05), albeit practically small increases in undesirable ratings. For instance, for each additional percentage of time working with the right arm elevated ≥60°, self-reported discomfort ratings increased 0.02 cm on a standard 10 cm visual analog scale. Female workers reported less discomfort and distraction while wearing the sensors at work than males (discomfort, beta = -0.93; distraction, beta = -0.3). In general, the low ratings of discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing the devices during work suggests that inertial sensors may be suitable for extended use among manufacturing workers.",0
521,Real-world user experience with seizure detection wearable devices in the home environment,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate direct user experience with wearable seizure detection devices in the home environment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A structured online questionnaire was completed by 242 users (175 caregivers and 67 persons with epilepsy), most of the patients (87.19%) having tonic-clonic seizures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The vast majority of the users were overall satisfied with the wearable device, considered that using the device was easy, and agreed that the use of the device improved their quality of life (median = 6 on 7-point Likert scale). A high retention rate (84.58%) and a long median usage time (14 months) were reported. In the home environment, most users (75.85%) experienced seizure detection sensitivity similar (≥95%) to what was previously reported in validation studies in epilepsy monitoring units. The experienced false alarm rate was relatively low (0-0.43 per day). Due to the alarms, almost one third of persons with epilepsy (PWEs; 30.00%) experienced decrease in the number of seizure-related injuries, and almost two thirds of PWEs (65.41%) experienced improvement in the accuracy of seizure diaries. Nonvalidated devices had significantly lower retention rate, overall satisfaction, perceived sensitivity, and improvement in quality of life, as compared with validated devices.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      Our results demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of automated seizure detection in the home environment.",7
522,Smartphone Apps for Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review,"Background:
        
      
      There is increasing interest in using mobile technologies such as smartphones for improving the care of patients with schizophrenia. However, less is known about the current clinical evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of smartphone apps in this population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To review the published literature of smartphone apps applied for the care of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An electronic database search of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, PsycINFO, and Embase was conducted on May 24, 2015. All eligible studies were systematically reviewed, and proportional meta-analyses were applied to pooled data on recruitment, retention, and adherence to examine the overall feasibility of smartphone interventions for schizophrenia.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our search produced 226 results from which 7 eligible articles were identified, reporting on 5 studies of smartphone apps for patients with schizophrenia. All examined feasibility, and one assessed the preliminary efficacy of a smartphone intervention for schizophrenia. Study lengths varied between 6 and 130 days. Overall retention was 92% (95% CI 82-98%). Participants consistently used the smartphone apps on more than 85% of days during the study period, averaging 3.95 interactions per person per day. Furthermore, participants responded to 71.9% of automated prompts (95% CI 65.7-77.8%). Participants reported a range of potential benefits from the various interventions, and user experience was largely positive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although small, the current published literature demonstrates strong evidence for the feasibility of using smartphones to enhance the care of people with schizophrenia. High rates of engagement and satisfaction with a broad range of apps suggest the nascent potential of this mobile technology. However, there remains limited data on the efficacy of such interventions.",4
523,From Bits of Data to Bits of Knowledge-An On-Board Classification Framework for Wearable Sensing Systems,"Wearable systems constitute a promising solution to the emerging challenges of healthcare provision, feeding machine learning frameworks with necessary data. In practice, however, raw data collection is expensive in terms of energy, and therefore imposes a significant maintenance burden to the user, which in turn results in poor user experience, as well as significant data loss due to improper battery maintenance. In this paper, we propose a framework for on-board activity classification targeting severely energy-constrained wearable systems. The proposed framework leverages embedded classifiers to activate power-hungry sensing elements only when they are useful, and to distil the raw data into knowledge that is eventually transmitted over the air. We implement the proposed framework on a prototype wearable system and demonstrate that it can decrease the energy requirements by one order of magnitude, yielding high classification accuracy that is reduced by approximately 5%, as compared to a cloud-based reference system.",1
524,The emerging clinical role of wearables: factors for successful implementation in healthcare,"Wearable technologies promise to redefine assessment of health behaviors, yet their clinical implementation remains a challenge. To address this gap, two of the NIH's Big Data to Knowledge Centers of Excellence organized a workshop on potential clinical applications of wearables. A workgroup comprised of 14 stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (hospital administration, clinical medicine, academia, insurance, and the commercial device industry) discussed two successful digital health interventions that involve wearables to identify common features responsible for their success. Seven features were identified including: a clearly defined problem, integration into a system of healthcare delivery, technology support, personalized experience, focus on end-user experience, alignment with reimbursement models, and inclusion of clinician champions. Health providers and systems keen to establish new models of care inclusive of wearables may consider these features during program design. A better understanding of these features is necessary to guide future clinical applications of wearable technology.",2
525,A Wearable Virtual Usher for Vision-Based Cognitive Indoor Navigation,"Inspired by progresses in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and mobile computing technologies, we propose and implement a wearable virtual usher for cognitive indoor navigation based on egocentric visual perception. A novel computational framework of cognitive wayfinding in an indoor environment is proposed, which contains a context model, a route model, and a process model. A hierarchical structure is proposed to represent the cognitive context knowledge of indoor scenes. Given a start position and a destination, a Bayesian network model is proposed to represent the navigation route derived from the context model. A novel dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model is proposed to accommodate the dynamic process of navigation based on real-time first-person-view visual input, which involves multiple asynchronous temporal dependencies. To adapt to large variations in travel time through trip segments, we propose an online adaptation algorithm for the DBN model, leading to a self-adaptive DBN. A prototype system is built and tested for technical performance and user experience. The quantitative evaluation shows that our method achieves over 13% improvement in accuracy as compared to baseline approaches based on hidden Markov model. In the user study, our system guides the participants to their destinations, emulating a human usher in multiple aspects.",3
526,The Mining Minds digital health and wellness framework,"Background:
        
      
      The provision of health and wellness care is undergoing an enormous transformation. A key element of this revolution consists in prioritizing prevention and proactivity based on the analysis of people's conducts and the empowerment of individuals in their self-management. Digital technologies are unquestionably destined to be the main engine of this change, with an increasing number of domain-specific applications and devices commercialized every year; however, there is an apparent lack of frameworks capable of orchestrating and intelligently leveraging, all the data, information and knowledge generated through these systems.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This work presents Mining Minds, a novel framework that builds on the core ideas of the digital health and wellness paradigms to enable the provision of personalized support. Mining Minds embraces some of the most prominent digital technologies, ranging from Big Data and Cloud Computing to Wearables and Internet of Things, as well as modern concepts and methods, such as context-awareness, knowledge bases or analytics, to holistically and continuously investigate on people's lifestyles and provide a variety of smart coaching and support services.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This paper comprehensively describes the efficient and rational combination and interoperation of these technologies and methods through Mining Minds, while meeting the essential requirements posed by a framework for personalized health and wellness support. Moreover, this work presents a realization of the key architectural components of Mining Minds, as well as various exemplary user applications and expert tools to illustrate some of the potential services supported by the proposed framework.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Mining Minds constitutes an innovative holistic means to inspect human behavior and provide personalized health and wellness support. The principles behind this framework uncover new research ideas and may serve as a reference for similar initiatives.",2
527,Workshop on Emerging Technology and Data Analytics for Behavioral Health,"Wearable and portable digital devices can support self-monitoring for patients with chronic medical conditions, individuals seeking to reduce stress, and people seeking to modify health-related behaviors such as substance use or overeating. The resulting data may be used directly by a consumer, or shared with a clinician for treatment, a caregiver for assistance, or a health coach for support. The data can also be used by researchers to develop and evaluate just-in-time interventions that leverage mobile technology to help individuals manage their symptoms and behavior in real time and as needed. Such wearable systems have huge potential for promoting delivery of anywhere-anytime health care, improving public health, and enhancing the quality of life for many people. The Center for Technology and Behavioral Health at Dartmouth College, a P30 ""Center of Excellence"" supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health, conducted a workshop in February 2017 on innovations in emerging technology, user-centered design, and data analytics for behavioral health, with presentations by a diverse range of experts in the field. The workshop focused on wearable and mobile technologies being used in clinical and research contexts, with an emphasis on applications in mental health, addiction, and health behavior change. In this paper, we summarize the workshop panels on mobile sensing, user experience design, statistics and machine learning, and privacy and security, and conclude with suggested research directions for this important and emerging field of applying digital approaches to behavioral health. Workshop insights yielded four key directions for future research: (1) a need for behavioral health researchers to work iteratively with experts in emerging technology and data analytics, (2) a need for research into optimal user-interface design for behavioral health technologies, (3) a need for privacy-oriented design from the beginning of a novel technology, and (4) the need to develop new analytical methods that can scale to thousands of individuals and billions of data points.",2
528,StayFit: a wearable application for Gym based power training,"Comprehensive fitness training involves both cardiorespiratory and power components. Often power/muscle strength training is confused with cardiorespiratory endurance training. However, each of them target different physiological aspects of fitness. Although, wearable based fitness trackers designed towards cardiorespiratory endurance training are available in the market, a dedicated wearable based fitness application designed for power training/tracking is still not readily available to fitness enthusiasts. With growing usage of wearable technology to manage and track personal health, it is imperative to develop health/fitness applications for wearables. A wearable based application for power training will allow the user to track build-up of muscle strength unobtrusively over a period of time. This work provides a framework and design for automatic detection, counting repetitions of strength training Gym exercises (covering all the major muscle groups), estimate personalized calories spent in each session and track power on a standalone Gear watch (both analysis and display including User Experience(UX) design). Our proposed method detects activity with ~96% sensitivity and ~96% specificity on an average and count repetitions with an overall accuracy of >95% using motion sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope) for eight major Gym exercises. Additionally, using heart rate sensor data we have provided a mechanism to individually track the power/muscle strength of a person. This work will give further impetus towards developing wearable based systems for personalized fitness tracking and training. This will also give an option for wearable users to address both the crucial aspects of fitness (cardiorespiratory and muscle strength).",2
529,A Non-Resonant Piezoelectric-Electromagnetic-Triboelectric Hybrid Energy Harvester for Low-Frequency Human Motions,"With the rapid development of wireless communication and micro-power technologies, smart wearable devices with various functionalities appear more and more in our daily lives. Nevertheless, they normally possess short battery life and need to be recharged with external power sources with a long charging time, which seriously affects the user experience. To help extend the battery life or even replace it, a non-resonant piezoelectric-electromagnetic-triboelectric hybrid energy harvester is presented to effectively harvest energy from low-frequency human motions. In the designed structure, a moving magnet is used to simultaneously excite the three integrated energy collection units (i.e., piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and triboelectric) with a synergistic effect, such that the overall output power and energy-harvesting efficiency of the hybrid device can be greatly improved under various excitations. The experimental results show that with a vibration frequency of 4 Hz and a displacement of 200 mm, the hybrid energy harvester obtains a maximum output power of 26.17 mW at 70 kΩ for one piezoelectric generator (PEG) unit, 87.1 mW at 500 Ω for one electromagnetic generator (EMG) unit, and 63 μW at 140 MΩ for one triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) unit, respectively. Then, the generated outputs are adopted for capacitor charging, which reveals that the performance of the three-unit integration is remarkably stronger than that of individual units. Finally, the practical energy-harvesting experiments conducted on various body parts such as wrist, calf, hand, and waist indicate that the proposed hybrid energy harvester has promising application potential in constructing a self-powered wearable system as the sustainable power source.",3
530,Survey of transfemoral amputee experience and priorities for the user-centered design of powered robotic transfemoral prostheses,"Background:
        
      
      Transfemoral amputees experience a complex host of physical, psychological, and social challenges, compounded by the functional limitations of current transfemoral prostheses. However, the specific relationships between human factors and prosthesis design and performance characteristics have not yet been adequately investigated. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive single-cohort survey of 114 unilateral transfemoral amputees addressed a broad range of demographic and clinical characteristics, functional autonomy, satisfaction and attitudes towards their current prostheses, and design priorities for an ideal transfemoral prosthesis, including the possibility of active assistance from a robotic knee unit. The survey was custom-developed based on several standard questionnaires used to assess motor abilities and autonomy in activities of daily living, prosthesis satisfaction, and quality of life in lower-limb amputees. Survey data were analyzed to compare the experience (including autonomy and satisfaction) and design priorities of users of transfemoral prostheses with versus without microprocessor-controlled knee units (MPKs and NMPKs, respectively), with a subsequent analyses of cross-category correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), cost-sensitivity segmentation, and unsupervised K-means clustering applied within the most cost-sensitive participants, to identify functional groupings of users with respect to their design priorities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cohort featured predominantly younger (< 50 years) traumatic male amputees with respect to the general transfemoral amputee population, with pronounced differences in age distribution and amputation etiology (traumatic vs. non-traumatic) between MPK and NMPK groups. These differences were further reflected in user experience, with MPK users reporting significantly greater overall functional autonomy, satisfaction, and sense of prosthesis ownership than those with NMPKs, in conjunction with a decreased incidence of instability and falls. Across all participants, the leading functional priorities for an ideal transfemoral prosthesis were overall stability, adaptability to variable walking velocity, and lifestyle-related functionality, while the highest-prioritized general characteristics were reliability, comfort, and weight, with highly variable prioritization of cost according to reimbursement status. PCA and user clustering analyses revealed the possibility for functionally relevant groupings of prosthesis features and users, based on their differential prioritization of these features-with implications towards prosthesis design tradeoffs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study's findings support the understanding that when appropriately prescribed according to patient characteristics and needs in the context of a proactive rehabilitation program, advanced transfemoral prostheses promote patient mobility, autonomy, and overall health. Survey data indicate overall stability, modularity, and versatility as key design priorities for the continued development of transfemoral prosthesis technology. Finally, observed associations between prosthesis type, user experience, and attitudes concerning prosthesis ownership suggest both that prosthesis characteristics influence device acceptance and functional outcomes, and that psychosocial factors should be specifically and proactively addressed during the rehabilitation process.",3
531,Real-Time Robust Heart Rate Estimation From Wrist-Type PPG Signals Using Multiple Reference Adaptive Noise Cancellation,"Heart rate (HR) monitoring using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals recorded from wearers' wrist greatly facilitates design of wearable devices and maximizes user experience. However, placing PPG sensors in wrist causes much stronger and complicated motion artifacts (MA) due to loose interface between sensors and skin. Therefore, developing robust HR estimation algorithms for wrist-type PPG signals has significant commercial values. In this paper, we propose a robust HR estimation algorithm for wrist-type PPG signals using multiple reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) technique-termed here as ""MURAD."" The main challenge of using ANC for MA reduction is to devise a qualified reference noise signal (RNS) to the adaptive filter. We propose a novel solution by using four RNSs, namely, the three-axis accelerometer data and the difference signal between the two PPG signals. For each RNS, we get a different version of the cleaned PPG signal. Then, a set of probable HR values is estimated using all of the cleaned PPG signals, and then, the value that is closest to the estimated HR of the previous time window is chosen to be the HR estimate of the current window. Then, some peak verification techniques are employed to ensure accurate HR estimations. The proposed technique gives lower average absolute error compared to state-of-the art methods. So, MURAD method provides a promising solution to the challenge of HR monitoring using PPG in wearable devices during severe MA conditions.",5
532,Trials and Tribulations: mHealth Clinical Trials in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Introduction:
        
      
      Mobile phone-based interventions in cardiovascular disease are growing in popularity. A randomised control trial (RCT) for a novel smartphone app-based model of care, named TeleClinical Care - Cardiac (TCC-Cardiac), commenced in February 2019, targeted at patients being discharged after care for an acute coronary syndrome or episode of decompensated heart failure. The app was paired to a digital sphygmomanometer, weighing scale and a wearable fitness band, all loaned to the patient, and allowed clinicians to respond to abnormal readings. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated several modifications to the trial in order to protect participants from potential exposure to infection. The use of TCC-Cardiac during the pandemic inspired the development of a similar model of care (TCC-COVID), targeted at patients being managed at home with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Recruitment for the TCC-Cardiac trial was terminated shortly after the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Telephone follow-up was commenced, in order to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to hospital staff and patients. Equipment was returned or collected by a 'no-contact' method. The TCC-COVID app and model of care had similar functionality to the original TCC-Cardiac app. Participants were enrolled exclusively by remote methods. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate were measured by a pulse oximeter, and symptomatology measured by questionnaire. Measurement results were manually entered into the app and transmitted to an online server for medical staff to review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 164 patients were involved in the TCC-Cardiac trial, with 102 patients involved after the onset of the pandemic. There were no hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in this cohort. The study was successfully completed, with only three participants lost to follow-up. During the pandemic, 5 of 49 (10%) of patients in the intervention arm were readmitted compared to 12 of 53 (23%) in the control arm. Also, in this period, 28 of 29 (97%) of all clinically significant alerts received by the monitoring team were managed successfully in the outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalisation. Patients found the user experience largely positive, with the average rating for the app being 4.56 out of 5. 26 patients have currently been enrolled for TCC-COVID. Recruitment is ongoing. All patients have been safely and effectively monitored, with no major adverse clinical events or technical malfunctions. Patient satisfaction has been high.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The TCC-Cardiac RCT was successfully completed despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Use of the app had an added benefit during the pandemic as participants could be monitored safely from home. The model of care inspired the development of an app with similar functionality designed for use with patients diagnosed with COVID-19.",9
533,Consumer Wearable Information and Health Self Management by Older Adults,"Background:
        
      
      The present study was undertaken to build an evidence base focusing on an ageing population who are using or have used consumer wearables to collect and manage information about their personal health status. The primary objective was to understand the health self-management requirements, frailty and age related changes, and the health information support provided by consumer wearable devices, specifically in the context of older adults living independently.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The study aimed to recruit older adults to respond to an online questionnaire. Inclusion criteria for the selection of study participants were: Aged 55 or over, independent living, and currently using or having used a wearable device or devices for health self-management in the past year. The online survey questionnaire represented a cross-section of variables in three sections: (1) Use of wearables for health monitoring, (2) Demographics and (3) Health, physical condition and wellness. A subset of the questions was drawn from the Tilburg Frailty Indicator.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Summary findings from the completed questionnaires suggest the use of wearable health information supports aspects of health self-management activities among independent living seniors. Personal variations and user characteristics in the extent and consistency of the use of wearable information, and user experience in the process, was more difficult to extrapolate, for example, in health information sharing.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Responses to the survey do not indicate widespread use of information from consumer wearables for health self-management among older adults. However, among the respondents, more than half were willing to participate in a follow-up interview by a researcher on their wearable health information use. Further research will explore what they have to say about this information use in relation to frailty and age related changes, and about the way that such information may be integrated into health and aged care support systems.",2
534,Feasibility of Wearable Display Glasses for Medical Students in the Endoscopy Room,"Background/aims:
        
      
      Several attempts have been made to incorporate smart glasses in the medical field. We applied wearable display glasses to show the position of an observer during endoscopy and compared students' responses between the conventional and new methods.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We surveyed 28 medical students regarding the use of wearable display devices. The students used wearable display glasses to observe an endoscopic procedure and answered the prepared questionnaire. Their collected responses were analyzed for statistical correlations between each variable.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survey of medical students revealed disadvantages including dizziness (dissatisfied and very dissatisfied: 21.5%) and eye fatigue (25% dissatisfied) and advantages including concentration (satisfied and very satisfied: 57.2%) and securing patient rights (71.4%). The students showed more positive than negative reviews regarding the new devices (32.1% vs. 21.5%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We investigated the advantages and disadvantages of viewing the endoscope image with new wearable display glasses compared to the conventional method using the survey to record user experience. The results revealed relatively positive responses from the medical students in the survey. If the new device compensates for some shortcomings, its use in the endoscopy room will be feasible.",4
535,Mixed reality holograms for heart surgery planning: first user experience in congenital heart disease,"Aims:
        
      
      Proof of concept and feasibility study for preoperative diagnostic use of mixed reality (MR) holograms of individual 3D heart models from standard cardiac computed tomography angiograms (CTA) images. Optimal repair for complex congenital heart disease poses high demands on 3D anatomical imagination. Three-dimensional printed heart models are increasingly used for improved morphological understanding during surgical and interventional planning. Holograms are a dynamic and interactive alternative, probably with wider applications.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      A 3D heart model was segmented from CTA images in a patient with double outlet right ventricle and transposition of the great arteries (DORV-TGA). The hologram was visualized in the wearable MR platform HoloLens® for 36 paediatric heart team members who filled out a diagnostic and quality rating questionnaire. Morphological and diagnostic output from the hologram was assessed and the 3D experience was evaluated. Locally developed app tools such as hologram rotation, scaling, and cutting were rated. Anatomy identification and diagnostic output was high as well as rating of 3D experience. Younger and female users rated the app tools higher.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This preliminary study demonstrates that MR holograms as surgical planning tool for congenital heart disease may have a high diagnostic value and contribute to understanding complex morphology. The first users experience of the hologram presentation was found to be very positive, with a preference among the female and the younger users. There is potential for improvement of the hologram manipulation tools.",0
536,"Automatic Mobile Health Arrhythmia Monitoring for the Detection of Atrial Fibrillation: Prospective Feasibility, Accuracy, and User Experience Study","Background:
        
      
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common tachyarrhythmia and associated with a risk of stroke. The detection and diagnosis of AF represent a major clinical challenge due to AF's asymptomatic and intermittent nature. Novel consumer-grade mobile health (mHealth) products with automatic arrhythmia detection could be an option for long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-based rhythm monitoring and AF detection.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of a wearable automated mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, including a consumer-grade, single-lead heart rate belt ECG device (heart belt), a mobile phone application, and a cloud service with an artificial intelligence (AI) arrhythmia detection algorithm for AF detection. The specific aim of this proof-of-concept study was to test the feasibility of the entire sequence of operations from ECG recording to AI arrhythmia analysis and ultimately to final AF detection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients (n=159) with an AF (n=73) or sinus rhythm (n=86) were recruited from the emergency department. A single-lead heart belt ECG was recorded for 24 hours. Simultaneously registered 3-lead ECGs (Holter) served as the gold standard for the final rhythm diagnostics and as a reference device in a user experience survey with patients over 65 years of age (high-risk group).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The heart belt provided a high-quality ECG recording for visual interpretation resulting in 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AF detection. The accuracy of AF detection with the automatic AI arrhythmia detection from the heart belt ECG recording was also high (97.5%), and the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 95.4%, respectively. The correlation between the automatic estimated AF burden and the true AF burden from Holter recording was >0.99 with a mean burden error of 0.05 (SD 0.26) hours. The heart belt demonstrated good user experience and did not significantly interfere with the patient's daily activities. The patients preferred the heart belt over Holter ECG for rhythm monitoring (85/110, 77% heart belt vs 77/109, 71% Holter, P=.049).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A consumer-grade, single-lead ECG heart belt provided good-quality ECG for rhythm diagnosis. The mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system, consisting of heart-belt ECG, a mobile phone application, and an automated AF detection achieved AF detection with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, the mHealth arrhythmia monitoring system showed good user experience.

537,Technology-Mediated Experiences and Social Context: Relevant Needs in Private Vs. Public Interaction and the Importance of Others for Positive Affect,"Technologies, such as smartphones or wearables, take a central role in our daily lives. Making their use meaningful and enjoyable requires a better understanding of the prerequisites and underpinnings of positive experiences with such technologies. So far, a focus had been on the users themselves, that is, their individual goals, desires, feelings, and acceptance. However, technology is often used in a social context, observed by others or even used in interaction with others, and thus shapes social dynamics considerably. In the present paper, we start from the notion that meaningful and/or enjoyable experiences (i.e., wellbeing) are a major outcome of technology use. We investigate how these experiences are further shaped by social context, such as potential spectators. More specifically, we gathered private (while being alone) and public (while other people are present) positive experiences with technology and compared need fulfillment and affective experience. In addition, we asked participants to imagine a change in context (from private to public or public to private) and to report the impact of this change on experience. Results support the idea of particular social needs, such as relatedness and popularity, which are especially relevant and better fulfilled in public than in private contexts. Moreover, our findings show that participants experience less positive affect when imaginatively removing the present others from a formerly public interaction, i.e., when they imagine performing the same interaction but without the other people present. Overall, this underlines the importance of social context for Human-Computer Interaction practice and research. Practical implications relate to product development, e.g., designing interactive technologies that can adapt to context (changes) or allow for context-sensitive interaction sets. We discuss limitations related to the experimental exploration of social context, such as the method of data collection, as well as potential alternatives to address those limitations, such as diary studies.",3
538,Testing for Wearability and Reliability of TPU Lamination Method in E-Textiles,"Electronic textiles (e-textiles) and wearable computing have been emerging increasingly during the last decade. Since the market interest and predictions have grown, the research into increasing reliability and durability of wearables and e-textiles is developing rapidly. The washability of different integration methods and resistance to mechanical stress are the main obstacles being tackled. However, the freedom of movement and overall comfort is still often overlooked during the development phase. It is essential to see the e-textile product as a whole and consider several aspects of user experience. This work will focus on developing and improving the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) lamination integration method for e-textiles. In the work, a stretchable copper-polyimide based circuit was laminated onto knit fabric using various TPU films and stacks. The study shares measurable characteristics to determine which material assembly and design would ensure the highest durability for the electronics part without losing its original textile softness, flexibility and stretchability.",0
539,Wellbeing in the Making: Peoples' Experiences with Wearable Activity Trackers,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers have become a viable business opportunity. Nevertheless, research has raised concerns over their potentially detrimental effects on wellbeing. For example, a recent study found that while counting steps with a pedometer increased steps taken throughout the day, at the same time it decreased the enjoyment people derived from walking. This poses a serious threat to the incorporation of healthy routines into everyday life. Most studies aim at proving the effectiveness of activity trackers. In contrast, a wellbeing-oriented perspective calls for a deeper understanding of how trackers create and mediate meaningful experiences in everyday life.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We present a study of real life experiences with three wearable activity trackers: Fitbit, Jawbone Up and Nike + Fuelband. Using need fulfillment as a theoretical lens, we study recent, memorable experiences submitted by 133 users of activity trackers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We reveal a two-dimensional structure of users' experience driven by the needs of physical thriving or relatedness. Our qualitative findings further show a nuanced picture of the adoption of activity trackers and their impact on wellbeing. For instance, while reflection about own exercising practices lost its relevance over time, users continued to wear the tracker to document and collect their runs. More than just supporting behavioral change, we find trackers to provide multiple psychological benefits. For instance, they enhance feelings of autonomy as people gain more control about their exercising regime. Others experience relatedness, when family members purchase a tracker for relatives and join them in their efforts towards a better, healthier self.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study highlights that activity trackers can be more than ""tools"" to change behavior. Through incorporation in daily life, they offer new social experiences, new ways of boosting our self-esteem and getting closer to our ideal selves.",3

541,Wearable Design Requirements Identification and Evaluation,"Wearable electronics make it possible to monitor human activity and behavior. Most of these devices have not taken into account human factors and they have instead focused on technological issues. This fact could not only affect human-computer interaction and user experience but also the devices' use cycle. Firstly, this paper presents a classification of wearable design requirements that have been carried out by combining a quantitative and a qualitative methodology. Secondly, we present some evaluation procedures based on design methodologies and human-computer interaction measurement tools. Thus, this contribution aims to provide a roadmap for wearable designers and researchers in order to help them to find more efficient processes by providing a classification of the design requirements and evaluation tools. These resources represent time and resource-saving contributions. Therefore designers and researchers do not have to review the literature. It will no be necessary to carry out exploratory studies for the purposes of identifying requirements or evaluation tools either.",0
542,Patient-centered activity monitoring in the self-management of chronic health conditions,"Background:
        
      
      As activity tracking devices become smaller, cheaper, and more consumer-accessible, they will be used more extensively across a wide variety of contexts. The expansion of activity tracking and personal data collection offers the potential for patient engagement in the management of chronic diseases. Consumer wearable devices for activity tracking have shown promise in post-surgery recovery in cardiac patients, pulmonary rehabilitation, and activity counseling in diabetic patients, among others. Unfortunately, the data generated by wearable devices is seldom integrated into programmatic self-management chronic disease regimens. In addition, there is lack of evidence supporting sustained use or effects on health outcomes, as studies have primarily focused on establishing the feasibility of monitoring activity and the association of measured activity with short-term benefits.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Monitoring devices can make a direct and real-time impact on self-management, but the validity and reliability of measurements need to be established. In order for patients to become engaged in wearable data gathering, key patient-centered issues relating to usefulness in care, motivation, the safety and privacy of information, and clinical integration need to be addressed. Because the successful usage of wearables requires an ability to comprehend and utilize personal health data, the user experience should account for individual differences in numeracy skills and apply evidence-based behavioral science principles to promote continued engagement.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Activity monitoring has the potential to engage patients as advocates in their personalized care, as well as offer health care providers real world assessments of their patients' daily activity patterns. This potential will be realized as the voice of the chronic disease patients is accounted for in the design of devices, measurements are validated against existing clinical assessments, devices become part of the treatment 'prescription', behavior change programs are used to engage patients in self-management, and best practices for clinical integration are defined.",2
543,"Evaluation of 1-Year in-Home Monitoring Technology by Home-Dwelling Older Adults, Family Caregivers, and Nurses","Introduction: Population aging is increasing the needs and costs of healthcare. Both frailty and the chronic diseases affecting older people reduce their ability to live independently. However, most older people prefer to age in their own homes. New development of in-home monitoring can play a role in staying independent, active, and healthy for older people. This 12-month observational study aimed to evaluate a new in-home monitoring system among home-dwelling older adults (OA), their family caregivers (FC), and nurses for the support of home care. Methods: The in-home monitoring system evaluated in this study continuously monitored OA's daily activities (e.g., mobility, sleep habits, fridge visits, door events) by ambient sensor system (DomoCare®) and health-related events by wearable sensors (Activity tracker, ECG). In the case of deviations in daily activities, alerts were transmitted to nurses via email. Using specific questionnaires, the opinions of 13 OA, 13 FC, and 20 nurses were collected at the end of 12-months follow-up focusing on user experience and the impact of in-home monitoring on home care services. Results: The majority of OA, FC, and nurses considered that in-home sensors can help with staying at home, improving home care and quality of life, preventing domestic accidents, and reducing family stress. The opinion tended to be more frequently favorable toward ambient sensors (76%; 95% CI: 61-87%) than toward wearable sensors (Activity tracker: 65%; 95% CI: 50-79%); ECG: 60%; 95% CI: 45-75%). On average, OA (74%; 95% CI: 46-95%) and FC (70%; 95% CI: 39-91%) tended to be more enthusiastic than nurses (60%; 95% CI: 36-81%). Some barriers reported by nurses were a fear of weakening of the relationship with OA and lack of time. Discussion/Conclusion: Overall, the opinions of OA, FC, and nurses were positively related to in-home sensors, with nurses being less enthusiastic about their use in clinical practice.",2
544,Determinants for Sustained Use of an Activity Tracker: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      A lack of physical activity is considered to cause 6% of deaths globally. Feedback from wearables such as activity trackers has the potential to encourage daily physical activity. To date, little research is available on the natural development of adherence to activity trackers or on potential factors that predict which users manage to keep using their activity tracker during the first year (and thereby increasing the chance of healthy behavior change) and which users discontinue using their trackers after a short time.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to identify the determinants for sustained use in the first year after purchase. Specifically, we look at the relative importance of demographic and socioeconomic, psychological, health-related, goal-related, technological, user experience-related, and social predictors of feedback device use. Furthermore, this study tests the effect of these predictors on physical activity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 711 participants from four urban areas in France received an activity tracker (Fitbit Zip) and gave permission to use their logged data. Participants filled out three Web-based questionnaires: at start, after 98 days, and after 232 days to measure the aforementioned determinants. Furthermore, for each participant, we collected activity data tracked by their Fitbit tracker for 320 days. We determined the relative importance of all included predictors by using Random Forest, a machine learning analysis technique.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The data showed a slow exponential decay in Fitbit use, with 73.9% (526/711) of participants still tracking after 100 days and 16.0% (114/711) of participants tracking after 320 days. On average, participants used the tracker for 129 days. Most important reasons to quit tracking were technical issues such as empty batteries and broken trackers or lost trackers (21.5% of all Q3 respondents, 130/601). Random Forest analysis of predictors revealed that the most influential determinants were age, user experience-related factors, mobile phone type, household type, perceived effect of the Fitbit tracker, and goal-related factors. We explore the role of those predictors that show meaningful differences in the number of days the tracker was worn.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study offers an overview of the natural development of the use of an activity tracker, as well as the relative importance of a range of determinants from literature. Decay is exponential but slower than may be expected from existing literature. Many factors have a small contribution to sustained use. The most important determinants are technical condition, age, user experience, and goal-related factors. This finding suggests that activity tracking is potentially beneficial for a broad range of target groups, but more attention should be paid to technical and user experience-related aspects of activity trackers.",3
545,A Wearable Detector for Simultaneous Finger Joint Motion Measurement,"This paper presents a wearable and stretchable detector for simultaneous finger joint motion measurement, providing the feasible technical solutions to solve the problems existing in the current devices. The sensor array installed in the detector consists of 14 custom-made bending sensors and an inertial measurement unit with high accuracy. The glove support for a sensor array, which is made of three silicone materials with different elasticity, not only overcomes the drawbacks of cloth support, but also addresses the compatibility between the stretch substrate and the inelastic sensing components. Besides, two-section electrical connection avoids the problems caused by the external wires in traditional solutions to enhance the durability of glove. The experiment results indicated that the wearable detector offers a good user experience by exerting a small force on fingers. The device also shows a strong durability as it worked properly after tens of thousands of bending. The measurement tests on a single sensor demonstrated that two kinds of sensors are both with high accuracy. Besides, the hand goniometric system has an excellent performance in terms of hand motion detection. The measurement error of the device in subjects with different hand sizes is within a reasonable range. The good properties of the sensory detector allow it to be applied in clinical applications.",0
546,Psychosocial impacts of hybrid closed-loop systems in the management of diabetes: a review,"There is a pressing need for new treatment regimens that enable improved glycaemic control and reduced diabetes self-management burdens. Closed-loop, or artificial pancreas, systems represent one of the most promising avenues in this regard. Closed-loop systems connect wearable continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors to smartphone- or tablet-mounted algorithms that process and model CGM data to deliver precise and frequently updated doses of fast-acting insulin (and glucagon in dual-hormone systems) to users via wearable pumps. Recent studies have demonstrated that closed-loop systems offer significant benefit in terms of improved glycaemic control. However, less attention has been paid to the psychosocial impact on users of closed-loop systems. This article reviews recent research on psychosocial aspects of closed-loop usage in light of preceding research on user experience of currently available technologies such as insulin pumps and CGM sensors. The small, but growing body of research in this field reports generally positive user experience and a number of experienced benefits including: reassurance and reduced anxiety, improved sleep and confidence, and 'time off' from diabetes demands. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by important challenges, ranging from variable levels of trust to concerns about physical bulk, technical glitches and difficulties incorporating closed-loop systems into everyday life. Future research should explore psychosocial aspects of closed-loop usage in more diverse groups and with regard to clinicians, as well as users, to ensure that the clinical benefits of closed-loop systems are realized at scale in routine medical care.",0
547,Efficacy of virtual reality in pedestrian safety research,"Advances in virtual reality technology present new opportunities for human factors research in areas that are dangerous, difficult, or expensive to study in the real world. The authors developed a new pedestrian simulator using the HTC Vive head mounted display and Unity software. Pedestrian head position and orientation were tracked as participants attempted to safely cross a virtual signalized intersection (5.5 m). In 10% of 60 trials, a vehicle violated the traffic signal and in 10.84% of these trials, a collision between the vehicle and the pedestrian was observed. Approximately 11% of the participants experienced simulator sickness and withdrew from the study. Objective measures, including the average walking speed, indicate that participant behavior in VR matches published real world norms. Subjective responses indicate that the virtual environment was realistic and engaging. Overall, the study results confirm the effectiveness of the new virtual reality technology for research on full motion tasks.",3
548,A Multi-Stage Human Factors and Comfort Assessment of Instrumented Insoles Designed for Use in a Connected Health Infrastructure,"Wearable electronics are gaining widespread use as enabling technologies, monitoring human physical activity and behavior as part of connected health infrastructures. Attention to human factors and comfort of these devices can greatly positively influence user experience, with a subsequently higher likelihood of user acceptance and lower levels of device rejection. Here, we employ a human factors and comfort assessment methodology grounded in the principles of human-centered design to influence and enhance the design of an instrumented insole. A use case was developed and interrogated by stakeholders, experts, and end users, capturing the context of use and user characteristics for the instrumented insole. This use case informed all stages of the design process through two full design cycles, leading to the development of an initial version 1 and a later version 2 prototype. Each version of the prototype was subjected to an expert human factors inspection and controlled comfort assessment using human volunteers. Structured feedback from the first cycle of testing was the driver of design changes implemented in the version 2 prototype. This prototype was found to have significantly improved human factors and comfort characteristics over the first version of the prototype. Expert inspection found that many of the original problems in the first prototype had been resolved in the second prototype. Furthermore, a comfort assessment of this prototype with a group of young healthy adults showed it to be indistinguishable from their normal footwear. This study demonstrates the power and effectiveness of human factors and comfort assessment methodologies in influencing and improving the design of wearable devices.",3
549,Tailorable and Wearable Textile Devices for Solar Energy Harvesting and Simultaneous Storage,"The pursuit of harmonic combination of technology and fashion intrinsically points to the development of smart garments. Herein, we present an all-solid tailorable energy textile possessing integrated function of simultaneous solar energy harvesting and storage, and we call it tailorable textile device. Our technique makes it possible to tailor the multifunctional textile into any designed shape without impairing its performance and produce stylish smart energy garments for wearable self-powering system with enhanced user experience and more room for fashion design. The ""threads"" (fiber electrodes) featuring tailorability and knittability can be large-scale fabricated and then woven into energy textiles. The fiber supercapacitor with merits of tailorability, ultrafast charging capability, and ultrahigh bending-resistance is used as the energy storage module, while an all-solid dye-sensitized solar cell textile is used as the solar energy harvesting module. Our textile sample can be fully charged to 1.2 V in 17 s by self-harvesting solar energy and fully discharged in 78 s at a discharge current density of 0.1 mA.",0
550,Persuasive Design Techniques and App Design Recommendations to Improve Health Workforce Capability in Rural Health Professionals: What Do Users Want and How Does an App Help?,"Background:
        
      
      Health professionals' perceptions of persuasive design techniques for use in technological solutions to improve health workforce capability have not been previously explored.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to explore rural health professionals' perceptions of health workforce capability and persuasive design techniques; and translate these into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase their impact and usefulness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Qualitative interviews with 13 rural health professionals were conducted. Subsequently, 32 persuasive techniques were used as a framework to deductively analyze the data. Persuasive design technique domains were Primary Task Support, Dialog Support, System Credibility Support, Social Support, and Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Persuasive design techniques can be applied across the factors that influence health workforce capability including health and personal qualities; competencies and skills; values, attitudes, and motivation; and factors that operate outside of work and at the team, organizational, and labor market levels. The majority of the 32 persuasive design techniques were reflected in the data from the interviews and led to recommendations as to how these could be translated into practice, with the exception of scarcity. Many suggestions and persuasive design techniques link back to the need for tailored and localized solutions such as the need for country-specific-based evidence, the wish for localized communities of practice, learning from other rural health professionals, and referral pathways to other clinicians. Participants identified how persuasive design techniques can optimize the user experience to help meet rural health professionals needs for more efficient systems to improve patient access to care, quality care, and to enable working in interprofessional team-based care. Social inclusion plays a vital role for health professionals, indicating the importance of the Social Support domain of persuasive techniques. Overall, health professionals were open to self-monitoring of their work performance and some professionals used wearables to monitor their health.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Rural health professionals' perceptions of health workforce capability informed which persuasive design techniques can be used to optimize the user experience of an app. These were translated into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase likelihood of adoption. This study has also contributed to the further validation of the Persuasive Systems Design model through empirically aligning elements of the model to increase persuasive system content and functionality with real-world applied data, in this case the health workforce capability of rural health professionals. Our findings confirm that these techniques can be used to develop a future prototype of an app that may assist health professionals in improving or maintaining their health workforce capability which in turn may increase recruitment and retention in rural areas. Health professionals need to be central during the design phase. Interventions are needed to provide a supportive environment to rural and remote health professionals to increase their rural health workforce capability.",2
551,Toward Detecting the Zone of Elite Tennis Players Through Wearable Technology,"Wearable devices fall short in providing information other than physiological metrics despite athletes' demand for psychological feedback. To address this, we introduce a preliminary exploration to track psychological states of athletes based on commercial wearable devices, coach observations and machine learning. Our system collects Inertial Measuring Unit data from tennis players, while their coaches provide labels on their psychological states. A recurrent neural network is then trained to predict coach labels from sensor data. We test our approach by predicting being in the zone, a psychological state of optimal performance. We conduct two experimental games with two elite coaches and four professional players for evaluation. Our learned models achieve above 85% test accuracy, implying that our approach could be utilized to predict the zone at relatively low cost. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications and feasibility of this approach by contextualizing it in a real-life scenario.",1
552,""" I Must Try Harder"": Design Implications for Mobile Apps and Wearables Contributing to Self-Efficacy of Patients With Chronic Conditions","Background:
        
      
      Diverse wellness-promoting mobile health technologies, including mobile apps and wearable trackers, became increasingly popular due to their ability to support patients' self-management of health conditions. However, the patient's acceptance and use depend on the perceived experience and the app appropriateness to the patient's context and needs. We have some understating of the experience and factors influencing the use of these technologies in the general public, but we have a limited understanding of these issues in patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      By presenting results from an explorative study, this paper aims to identify implications for the design of mobile apps and wearables to effectively support patients' efforts in self-management of health with a special emphasis on support for self-efficacy of activities contributing to health.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An explorative mixed-method study involving 200 chronically ill patients of Stanford Medical Center (Stanford, CA, United States) was conducted between mid-2016 and end of 2018. Amongst these, 20 patients were involved in a 4-weeks study, in which we collected the underlying wearable device use logs (e.g., Fitbit) and subjective use experience [via an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)], as well as patients' momentary perception of general self-efficacy in their natural environments and different daily contexts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results indicate that mobile apps for health and wearables have the potential to enable better self-management and improve patients' wellbeing but must be further refined to address different human aspects of their use. Specifically, the apps/wearables should be easier to use, more personalized and context-aware for the patient's overall routine and lifestyle choices, as well as with respect to the momentary patient state (e.g., location, type of people around) and health(care) needs. Additionally, apps and devices should be more battery efficient and accurate; providing timely, non-judgmental feedback and personalized advice to the patients anywhere-anytime-anyhow. These results are mapped on major sources of the individuals' self-efficacy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results show how the apps/wearables that are aimed at supporting the patients' self-management should be designed to leverage and further improve the patients' general self-efficacy and self-efficacy of activities contributing to chronic disease management.",2
553,Concept Test of a Smoking Cessation Smart Case,"Background:Wearable/portable devices that unobtrusively detect smoking and contextual data offer the potential to provide Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) support for mobile cessation programs. Little has been reported on the development of these technologies.Introduction:To address this gap, we offer a case report of users' experiences with a prototype ""smart"" cigarette case that automatically tracks time and location of smoking. Small-scale user-experience studies are typical of iterative product design and are especially helpful when proposing novel ideas. The purpose of the study was to assess concept acceptability and potential for further development.Materials and Methods:We tested the prototype case with a small sample of potential users (n = 7). Participants used the hardware/software for 2 weeks and reconvened for a 90-min focus group to discuss experiences and provide feedback.Results:Participants liked the smart case in principle but found the prototype too bulky for easy portability. The potential for the case to convey positive messages about self also emerged as a finding. Participants indicated willingness to pay for improved technology (USD $15-$60 on a one-time basis).Discussion:The smart case is a viable concept, but design detail is critical to user acceptance. Future research should examine designs that maximize convenience and that explore the device's ability to cue intentions and other cognitions that would support cessation.Conclusions:This study is the first to our knowledge to report formative research on the smart case concept. This initial exploration provides insights that may be helpful to other developers of JITAI-support technology.",3
554,High-Stability Flexible X-ray Detectors Based on Lead-Free Halide Perovskite Cs2TeI6 Films,"Normal flat panel X-ray detectors are confined in imaging of curved surfaces and three-dimensional objects. Except that, their rigid panels provide uncomfortable user experience in medical diagnosis. Here, we report a flexible X-ray detector fabricated by the combination of a lead-free Cs2TeI6 perovskite film and a polyimide (PI) substrate. High-quality Cs2TeI6 polycrystalline films are prepared by a low-temperature electrospraying method. The resistivity even remained at the level of 1011 Ω·cm after 100 cycles of bending tests with a low bending radius of 10 mm. The resulting flexible Cs2TeI6 detectors exhibit better response stability than those based on rigid SnO2:F glass (FTO), which is attributed to the superior crystallization of films and the growth stress relief of flexible substrates. Furthermore, an X-ray sensitivity of 76.27 μC·Gyair-1·cm-2 and a detection limit of 0.17 μGyair·s-1 are achieved. A series of distortion-free clear X-ray images are obtained for objects with different materials and densities. These findings provide insights into flexible X-ray detectors based on perovskite films and motivate research in wearable X-ray detectors for medical radiography and dose monitoring.",0
555,Low-complexity prediction of frequency-rich biosignals for lossless compression in wearable technologies,"Wearable technologies that store, monitor and analyse a range of biosignals are an area of significant growth and interest for both industry and academia. The rate of data generation in these devices poses a considerable challenge with regards to the bandwidths of wireless transmission protocols, local storage capacities and the on-board power consumption requirements. This issue is particularly acute for frequency-rich biosignals containing significant higher frequency components that are un-served by conventional compression techniques. This paper proposes a low-complexity predictor, based on a low-order infinite impulse response bandpass filter, to accurately predict such biosignals for use in lossless compression. Experimental evaluation of the method demonstrates that it outperforms conventional predictors with an average 25 % reduction in predictor residual standard deviation. The predictor described here enables high-bandwidth wearable sensors that can be employed in systems with reduced power consumption for transmission, storage and compression leading to considerable improvements in user experience by reducing device mass and increasing battery life.",5
556,A High-Speed SSVEP-Based BCI Using Dry EEG Electrodes,"A high-speed steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system using dry EEG electrodes was demonstrated in this study. The dry electrode was fabricated in our laboratory. It was designed as claw-like structure with a diameter of 14 mm, featuring 8 small fingers of 6 mm length and 2 mm diameter. The structure and elasticity can help the fingers pass through the hair and contact the scalp when the electrode is placed on head. The electrode was capable of recording spontaneous EEG and evoked brain activities such as SSVEP with high signal-to-noise ratio. This study implemented a twelve-class SSVEP-based BCI system with eight electrodes embedded in a headband. Subjects also completed a comfort level questionnaire with the dry electrodes. Using a preprocessing algorithm of filter bank analysis (FBA) and a classification algorithm based on task-related component analysis (TRCA), the average classification accuracy of eleven participants was 93.2% using 1-second-long SSVEPs, leading to an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 92.35 bits/min. All subjects did not report obvious discomfort with the dry electrodes. This result represented the highest communication speed in the dry-electrode based BCI systems. The proposed system could provide a comfortable user experience and a stable control method for developing practical BCIs.",3
557,Intelligent and Multifunctional Graphene Nanomesh Electronic Skin with High Comfort,"As the aging population increases in many countries, electronic skin (e-skin) for health monitoring has been attracting much attention. However, to realize the industrialization of e-skin, two factors must be optimized. The first is to achieve high comfort, which can significantly improve the user experience. The second is to make the e-skin intelligent, so it can detect and analyze physiological signals at the same time. In this article, intelligent and multifunctional e-skin consisting of laser-scribed graphene and polyurethane (PU) nanomesh is realized with high comfort. The e-skin can be used as a strain sensor with large measurement range (>60%), good sensitivity (GF≈40), high linearity range (60%), and excellent stability (>1000 cycles). By analyzing the morphology of e-skin, a parallel networks model is proposed to express the mechanism of the strain sensor. In addition, laser scribing is also applied to etch the insulating PU, which greatly decreases the impedance in detecting electrophysiology signals. Finally, the e-skin is applied to monitor the electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrooculogram signals. A time- and frequency-domain concatenated convolution neural network is built to analyze the EEG signal detected using the e-skin on the forehead and classify the attention level of testers.",0
558,HoloUS: Augmented reality visualization of live ultrasound images using HoloLens for ultrasound-guided procedures,"Purpose:
        
      
      Microsoft HoloLens is a pair of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses that could improve the intraprocedural visualization of ultrasound-guided procedures. With the wearable HoloLens headset, an ultrasound image can be virtually rendered and registered with the ultrasound transducer and placed directly in the practitioner's field of view.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A custom application, called HoloUS, was developed using the HoloLens and a portable ultrasound machine connected through a wireless network. A custom 3D-printed case with an AR-pattern for the ultrasound transducer permitted ultrasound image tracking and registration. Voice controls on the HoloLens supported the scaling and movement of the ultrasound image as desired. The ultrasound images were streamed and displayed in real-time. A user study was performed to assess the effectiveness of the HoloLens as an alternative display platform. Novices and experts were timed on tasks involving targeting simulated vessels using a needle in a custom phantom.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Technical characterization of the HoloUS app was conducted using frame rate, tracking accuracy, and latency as performance metrics. The app ran at 25 frames/s, had an 80-ms latency, and could track the transducer with an average reprojection error of 0.0435 pixels. With AR visualization, the novices' times improved by 17% but the experts' times decreased slightly by 5%, which may reflect the experts' training and experience bias.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The HoloUS application was found to enhance user experience and simplify hand-eye coordination. By eliminating the need to alternately observe the patient and the ultrasound images presented on a separate monitor, the proposed AR application has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided procedures.",3
559,Smart Offloading Boot System for Remote Patient Monitoring: Toward Adherence Reinforcement and Proper Physical Activity Prescription for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Patients,"Background:
        
      
      A critical factor in healing diabetic foot ulcers is patient adherence to offloading devices. We tested a smart offloading boot (SmartBoot) combined with a smartwatch app and cloud dashboard to remotely monitor patient adherence and activity. In addition, the impact of SmartBoot on balance, gait, and user experience was investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fourteen volunteers (31.6±8.7 years; 64% female) performed natural activities (eg, sitting, standing, walking) with and without the SmartBoot for approximately 30 minutes. All participants completed balance tests, 10-meter walking tests at slow, normal, and fast pace while wearing the SmartBoot, and a user experience questionnaire. The accuracy of real-time adherence reporting was assessed by comparing the SmartBoot and staff observation. Center of mass (COM) sway and step counts were measured using a validated wearable system.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adherence and non-adherence were 90.6%, 88.0%, and 89.3%, respectively. The COM sway area was significantly smaller with the SmartBoot than without the SmartBoot regardless of test condition. Step count error was 4.4% for slow waking, 36.2% for normal walking, 16.0% for fast walking. Most participants agreed that the SmartBoot is easy to use, relatively comfortable, nonintrusive, and innovative.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this is the first smart offloading system that enables remote patient monitoring and real-time adherence and activity reporting. The SmartBoot enhanced balance performance, likely due to somatosensory feedback. Questionnaire results highlight SmartBoot's technical and clinical potential. Future studies warrant clinical validation of real-time non-adherence alerting to improve wound healing outcomes in people with diabetic foot ulcers.",0
560,Participant Experiences of a COVID-19 Virtual Clinical Study Using the Current Health Remote Monitoring Platform: Case Study and Qualitative Analysis,"Background:
        
      
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with a positive viral test were enrolled in a study, within 48 hours, to remotely monitor their vital signs to characterize disease progression and recovery. A virtual trial design was adopted to reduce risks to participants and the research community in a study titled Risk Stratification and Early Alerting Regarding COVID-19 Hospitalization (RiskSEARCH). The Food and Drug Administration-cleared Current Health platform with a wearable device is a continuous remote patient monitoring technology that supports hospital-at-home care and is used as a data collection tool. Enrolled participants wore the Current Health wearable device continuously for up to 30 days and took a daily symptom survey via a tablet that was provided. A qualitative substudy was conducted in parallel to better understand virtual trial implementation, including barriers and facilitators for participants.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators of the user experience of interacting with a virtual care platform and research team, while participating in a fully virtual study using qualitative and quantitative data.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Semistructured interviews were conducted to understand participants' experience of participating in a virtual study during a global pandemic. The schedule included their experience of enrollment and their interactions with equipment and study staff. A total of 3 RiskSEARCH participants were interviewed over telephone, and transcriptions were inductively coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify and describe the factors that influenced study adherence. Quantitative metrics, including adherence to wearable and scheduled tasks collected as part of the RiskSEARCH main study, were paired with the interviews to present an overall picture of participation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All participants exceeded our definition of a fully adherent participant and reported that participation was feasible and had a low burden. The symptoms progressively resolved during the trial. Inductive thematic analysis identified 13 main themes from the interview data, which were deductively mapped onto 11 of the 14 TDF domains, highlighting barriers and facilitators for each.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Participants in the RiskSEARCH substudy showed high levels of adherence and engagement throughout participation. Although participants experienced some challenges in setting up and maintaining the Current Health kit (eg, charging devices), they reported feeling that the requirements of participation were both reasonable and realistic. We demonstrated that the TDF can be used for inductive thematic analysis. We anticipate expanding this work in future virtual studies and trials to identify barriers and enabling factors for implementation.",2
561,Contrasting the Expectations and Experiences Related to Mobile Health Use for Chronic Pain: Questionnaire Study,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic pain is a prolonged condition that deteriorates one's quality of life. Treating chronic pain requires a multicomponent approach, and in many cases, there are no ""silver bullet"" solutions. Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly expanding category of solutions in digital health with proven potential in chronic pain management.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to contrast the viewpoints of 2 groups of people with chronic pain concerning mHealth: people who have adopted the use of mHealth and those who have not. We highlight the benefits of mHealth solutions for people with chronic pain and the perceived obstacles to their increased adoption. We also provide recommendations to encourage people to try mHealth solutions as part of their self-care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Prolific crowdsourcing platform was used to collect crowdsourced data. A prescreening questionnaire was released to determine what type of pain potential participants have and whether they are currently using mHealth solutions for chronic pain. The participants were invited based on their experience using mHealth to manage their pain. Similar questions were presented to mHealth users and nonusers. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the outcomes of this study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 31 responses were collected from people (aged 19-63 years, mean 31.4, SD 12.1) with chronic pain who use mHealth solutions. Two-thirds (n=20, 65%) of the users identified as female and 11 (35%) as male. We matched these mHealth users with an equal number of nonusers: 31 responses from the pool of 361 participants in the prescreening questionnaire. The nonusers' ages ranged from 18 to 58 years (mean 30.8, SD 11.09), with 15 (50%) identifying as female and 15 (50%) as male. Likert-scale questions were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test. Results showed that the 2 groups differed significantly on 10 (43%) of 23 questions and shared similar views in the remaining 13 (57%). The most significant differences were related to privacy and interactions with health professionals. Of the 31 mHealth users, 12 (39%) declared that using mHealth solutions has made interacting with health or social care professionals easier (vs n=22, 71%, of nonusers). The majority of the nonusers (n=26, 84%) compared with about half of the users (n=15, 48%) expressed concern about sharing their data with, for example, third parties.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study investigated how mHealth is currently used in the context of chronic pain and what expectations mHealth nonusers have for mHealth as a future chronic pain management tool. Analysis revealed contrasts between mHealth use expectations and actual usage experiences, highlighting privacy concerns toward mHealth solutions. Generally, the results showed that nonusers are more concerned about data privacy and expect mHealth to facilitate interacting with health professionals. The users, in contrast, feel that such connections do not exist.",2
562,Variability in Reactions to Instructional Guidance during Smartphone-Based Assisted Navigation of Blind Users,"'Turn slightly to the left' the navigational system announces, with the aim of directing a blind user to merge into a corridor. Yet, due to long reaction time, the user turns too late and proceeds into the wrong hallway. Observations of such user behavior in real-world navigation settings motivate us to study the manner in which blind users react to the instructional feedback of a turn-by-turn guidance system. We found little previous work analyzing the extent of the variability among blind users in reaction to different instructional guidance during assisted navigation. To gain insight into how navigational interfaces can be better designed to accommodate the information needs of different users, we conduct a data-driven analysis of reaction variability as defined by motion and timing measures. Based on continuously tracked user motion during real-world navigation with a deployed system, we find significant variability between users in their reaction characteristics. Specifically, the statistical analysis reveals significant variability during the crucial elements of the navigation (e.g., turning and encountering obstacles). With the end-user experience in mind, we identify the need to not only adjust interface timing and content to each user's personal walking pace, but also their individual navigation skill and style. The design implications of our study inform the development of assistive systems which consider such user-specific behavior to ensure successful navigation.",7
563,Interactive balance training integrating sensor-based visual feedback of movement performance: a pilot study in older adults,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable sensor technology can accurately measure body motion and provide incentive feedback during exercising. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of a balance training program in older adults integrating data from wearable sensors into a human-computer interface designed for interactive training.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Senior living community residents (mean age 84.6) with confirmed fall risk were randomized to an intervention (IG, n = 17) or control group (CG, n = 16). The IG underwent 4 weeks (twice a week) of balance training including weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks with visual/auditory real-time joint movement feedback using wearable sensors. The CG received no intervention. Outcome measures included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) balance test at baseline and post-intervention. Ankle-hip postural coordination was quantified by a reciprocal compensatory index (RCI). Physical performance was quantified by the Alternate-Step-Test (AST), Timed-up-and-go (TUG), and gait assessment. User experience was measured by a standardized questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After the intervention sway of CoM, hip, and ankle were reduced in the IG compared to the CG during both EO and EC condition (p = .007-.042). Improvement was obtained for AST (p = .037), TUG (p = .024), fast gait speed (p = . 010), but not normal gait speed (p = .264). Effect sizes were moderate for all outcomes. RCI did not change significantly. Users expressed a positive training experience including fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor-feedback.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that older adults at risk of falling can benefit from the balance training program. Study findings may help to inform future exercise interventions integrating wearable sensors for guided game-based training in home- and community environments. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the proposed sensor-based training paradigm compared to traditional balance training programs and commercial exergames.

564,Applying Mobile Technology to Sustain Physical Activity After Completion of Cardiac Rehabilitation: Acceptability Study,"Background:
        
      
      Many patients do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity after completing a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. Wearable activity trackers and mobile phone apps are promising potential self-management tools for maintaining physical activity after CR completion.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to evaluate the acceptability of a wearable device, mobile app, and push messages to facilitate physical activity following CR completion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used semistructured interviews to assess the acceptability of various mobile technologies after participation in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Intervention patients in the randomized controlled trial wore the Fitbit Charge 2, used the Movn mobile app, and received push messages on cardiovascular disease prevention and physical activity for over 2 months. We asked 26 intervention group participants for feedback about their experience with the technology and conducted semistructured individual interviews with 7 representative participants. We used thematic analysis to create the main themes from individual interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our sample included participants with a mean age of 66.7 (SD 8.6) years; 23% (6/26) were female. Overall, there were varying levels of satisfaction with different technology components. There were 7 participants who completed the satisfaction questionnaires and participated in the interviews. The Fitbit and Movn mobile app received high satisfaction scores of 4.86 and 4.5, respectively, whereas push messages had a score of 3.14 out of 5. We identified four main themes through the interviews: technology use increased motivation to be physically active, technology use served as a reminder to be physically active, recommendations for technology to improve user experience, and desire for personal feedback.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      By applying a wearable activity tracker, mobile phone app, and push messages, our study showed strong potential for the adoption of new technologies by older adults to maintain physical activity after CR completion. Future research should include a larger sample over a longer period using a mixed methods approach to assess the efficacy of technology use for promoting long-term physical activity behavior in older adults.",3
565,Near-realistic mobile exergames with wireless wearable sensors,"Exergaming is expanding as an option for sedentary behavior in childhood/adult obesity and for extra exercise for gamers. This paper presents the development process for a mobile active sports exergame with near-realistic motions through the usage of body-wearable sensors. The process begins by collecting a dataset specifically targeted to mapping real-world activities directly to the games, then, developing the recognition system in a fashion to produce an enjoyable game. The classification algorithm in this paper has precision and recall of 77% and 77% respectively, compared with 40% and 19% precision and recall on current activity monitoring algorithms intended for general daily living activities. Aside from classification, the user experience must be strong enough to be a successful system for adoption. Indeed, fast and intense activities as well as competitive, multiplayer environments make for a successful, enjoyable exergame. This enjoyment is evaluated through a 30 person user study. Multiple aspects of the exergaming user experience trials have been merged into a comprehensive survey, called ExerSurvey. All but one user thought the motions in the game were realistic and difficult to cheat. Ultimately, a game with near-realistic motions was shown to be an enjoyable, active video exergame for any environment.",3
566,Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in an At-Home Setting,"Emerging digital tools have the potential to enable a new generation of qualitative and quantitative assessment of cognitive performance. Moreover, the ubiquity of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and tablets, can be harnessed to support large-scale self-assessed cognitive screening with benefit to healthcare systems and consumers. A wide variety of apps, wearables, and new digital technologies are either available or in development for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for dementia. Two categories of novel methodologies may be considered: passive technologies (which monitor a user's behavior without active user input) and interactive assessments (which require active user input). Such examinations can be self-administered, supervised by a caregiver, or conducted by an informant at home or outside of a clinical setting. These direct-to-consumer tools have the potential to sidestep barriers associated with cognitive evaluation in primary care, thus improving access to cognitive assessments. Although direct-to-consumer cognitive assessment is associated with its own barriers, including test validation, user experience, and technological concerns, it is conceivable that these issues can be addressed so that a large-scale, self-assessed cognitive evaluation that would represent an initial cognitive screen may be feasible in the future.",4
567,Sensor-based balance training with motion feedback in people with mild cognitive impairment,"Some individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) experience not only cognitive deficits but also a decline in motor function, including postural balance. This pilot study sought to estimate the feasibility, user experience, and effects of a novel sensor-based balance training program. Patients with amnestic MCI (mean age 78.2 yr) were randomized to an intervention group (IG, n = 12) or control group (CG, n = 10). The IG underwent balance training (4 wk, twice a week) that included weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing. Real-time visual/audio lower-limb motion feedback was provided from wearable sensors. The CG received no training. User experience was measured by a questionnaire. Postintervention effects on balance (center of mass sway during standing with eyes open [EO] and eyes closed), gait (speed, variability), cognition, and fear of falling were measured. Eleven participants (92%) completed the training and expressed fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor feedback. Sway (EO, p = 0.04) and fear of falling (p = 0.02) were reduced in the IG compared to the CG. Changes in other measures were nonsignificant. Results suggest that the sensor-based training paradigm is well accepted in the target population and beneficial for improving postural control. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the sensor-based training compared to traditional training.",7
568,A Wireless Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Device for Flap Monitoring: Proof of Concept in a Porcine Musculocutaneous Flap Model,"Background:
        
      
       Current near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based systems for continuous flap monitoring are highly sensitive for detecting malperfusion. However, the clinical utility and user experience are limited by the wired connection between the sensor and bedside console. This wire leads to instability of the flap-sensor interface and may cause false alarms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
       We present a novel wearable wireless NIRS sensor for continuous fasciocutaneous free flap monitoring. This waterproof silicone-encapsulated Bluetooth-enabled device contains two light-emitting diodes and two photodetectors in addition to a battery sufficient for 5 days of uninterrupted function. This novel device was compared with a ViOptix T.Ox monitor in a porcine rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap model of arterial and venous occlusions.
    


          Results:
        
      
       Devices were tested in four flaps using three animals. Both devices produced very similar tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) tracings throughout the vascular clamping events, with obvious and parallel changes occurring on arterial clamping, arterial release, venous clamping, and venous release. Small interdevice variations in absolute StO2 value readings and magnitude of change were observed. The normalized cross-correlation at zero lag describing correspondence between the novel NIRS and T.Ox devices was >0.99 in each trial.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
       The wireless NIRS flap monitor is capable of detecting StO2 changes resultant from arterial vascular occlusive events. In this porcine flap model, the functionality of this novel sensor closely mirrored that of the T.Ox wired platform. This device is waterproof, highly adhesive, skin conforming, and has sufficient battery life to function for 5 days. Clinical testing is necessary to determine if this wireless functionality translates into fewer false-positive alarms and a better user experience.",5
569,Day and night comfort and stability on the body of four wearable devices for seizure detection: A direct user-experience,"Purpose:
        
      
      Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available tool for continuous seizure detection. Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and stable on the body.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the free text of the questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and fifteen participants were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger participants.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality.",5
570,A Wearable Daily Respiration Monitoring System Using PDMS-graphene Compound Tensile Sensor for Adult,"A wearable respiration monitoring system based on Respiratory induction plethysmography (RIP) using a new Polydimethylsiloxane-graphene (PDMS-graphene) compound tensile sensor is proposed. The manufacture procedure of this novel resistance-based tensile sensor is presented together with a wireless acquisition system. The proposed sensor shows a high sensitivity during stretching and a promising cyclic stability for continuous 3,600 cycles. Statistical analysis confirms a high correlation of respiratory rate monitoring between the proposed system and a medical-level instrument. This proposed system based on RIP, using a new PDMS-graphene compound tensile sensor can acquire respiratory signal unobtrusively with high accuracy and satisfactory user experience, and thus has great potential in home monitoring scenarios.",0
571,Perspectives on the Gamification of an Interactive Health Technology for Postoperative Rehabilitation of Pediatric Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: User-Centered Design Approach,"Background:
        
      
      Pediatric and adolescent athletes are a large demographic undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R). Postoperative rehabilitation is critical, requiring patients to complete home exercise programs (HEPs). To address obstacles to HEP adherence, we developed an interactive health technology, interACTION (iA), to monitor knee-specific rehabilitation. iA is a web-based platform that incorporates wearable motion sensors and a mobile app that provides feedback and allows remote monitoring. The Wheel of Sukr is a gamification mechanism that includes numerous behavioral elements.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aims to use a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral change strategies derived from self-management theory into iA using the Wheel of Sukr, with the aim of influencing patient behavior.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In total, 10 athletes aged 10-18 years with a history of ACL-R were included in this study. Patients were between 4 weeks and 1 year post-ACL-R. Participants underwent a 60-minute triphasic interview. Phase 1 focused on elements of gaming that led to high participation and information regarding surgery and recovery. In phase 2, participants were asked to think aloud and rank cards representing the components of the Wheel of Sukr in order of interest. In phase 3, the patients reviewed the current version of iA. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked for accuracy. Qualitative content analysis segmented the data and tagged meaningful codes until descriptive redundancy was achieved; next, 2 coders independently coded the data set. These elements were categorized according to the Wheel of Sukr framework. The mean age of participants was 12.8 (SD 1.32) years, and 70% (7/10) were female. Most participants (7/10, 70%) reported attending sessions twice weekly. All patients were prescribed home exercises. Self-reported HEP compliance was 75%-100% in 40% (4/10), 50%-75% in 40% (4/10), and 25%-50% of prescribed exercises in 20% (2/10) of the participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The participants responded positively to an app that could track home exercises. Desirable features included exercise demonstrations, motivational components, and convenience. The participants listed sports specificity, competition, notifications, reminders, rewards, and social aspects of gameplay as features to incorporate. In the Wheel of Sukr card sort exercise, motivation was ranked first; self-management, second; and growth, esteem, and fun tied for the third position. The recommended gameplay components closely followed the themes from the Wheel of Sukr card sort activity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The participants believe iA is a helpful addition to recovery and want the app to include exercise movement tracking and encouragement. Despite the small number of participants, thematic saturation was reached, suggesting the sample was sufficient to obtain a representative range of perspectives. Future work will implement motivation; self-management; and growth, confidence, and fun in the iA user experience. Young athlete ACL-R patients will complete typical clinical scenarios using increasingly developed prototypes of the gamified iA in a controlled setting.",2
572,Acceptability of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Free-Living Healthy Individuals: Implications for the Use of Wearable Biosensors in Diet and Physical Activity Research,"Background:
        
      
      Wearable sensors have been increasingly used in behavioral research for real-time assessment and intervention purposes. The rapid advancement of biomedical technology typically used in clinical settings has made wearable sensors more accessible to a wider population. Yet the acceptability of this technology for nonclinical purposes has not been examined.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim was to assess the acceptability of wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) device among a sample of nondiabetic individuals, and to compare the acceptability of a CGM between a mobile diet tracking app (MyFitnessPal) and an accelerometer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 30 nondiabetic adults went through a 7-day observational study. They wore a CGM sensor, tracked their diet and physical activity using the CGM receiver and MyFitnessPal, and wore an accelerometer on their waist. After the monitoring period, they completed a 10-item survey regarding acceptability of each of the study tools. Two-tailed paired-sample t tests were conducted to examine whether the summary acceptability scores were comparable between the CGM sensor/receiver and MyFitnessPal/accelerometer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      More than 90% of the study participants agreed that the CGM sensor and receiver were easy to use (28/30 and 27/30, respectively), useful (28/30 and 29/30, respectively), and provided relevant information that was of interest to them (27/30 and 28/30, respectively). The summary acceptability scores (out of a 5-point Likert scale) were mean 4.06 (SD 0.55) for the CGM sensor, mean 4.05 (SD 0.58) for the CGM receiver, mean 4.10 (SD 0.68) for MyFitnessPal, and mean 3.73 (SD 0.76) for the accelerometer.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The high acceptability of using a CGM from this study suggests a great potential for using CGMs in nondiabetic adults in research settings. Although potential selection bias might contribute to the high acceptability in this study, the continued advancements in wearable sensor technology will make the barriers to tracking and collecting personal physiological data more and more minimal.",2
573,User Experience of 7 Mobile Electroencephalography Devices: Comparative Study,"Background:
        
      
      Registration of brain activity has become increasingly popular and offers a way to identify the mental state of the user, prevent inappropriate workload, and control other devices by means of brain-computer interfaces. However, electroencephalography (EEG) is often related to user acceptance issues regarding the measuring technique. Meanwhile, emerging mobile EEG technology offers the possibility of gel-free signal acquisition and wireless signal transmission. Nonetheless, user experience research about the new devices is lacking.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to evaluate user experience aspects of emerging mobile EEG devices and, in particular, to investigate wearing comfort and issues related to emotional design.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We considered 7 mobile EEG devices and compared them for their wearing comfort, type of electrodes, visual appearance, and subjects' preference for daily use. A total of 24 subjects participated in our study and tested every device independently of the others. The devices were selected in a randomized order and worn on consecutive day sessions of 60-min duration. At the end of each session, subjects rated the devices by means of questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results indicated a highly significant change in maximal possible wearing duration among the EEG devices (χ26=40.2, n=24; P<.001). Regarding the visual perception of devices' headset design, results indicated a significant change in the subjects' ratings (χ26=78.7, n=24; P<.001). Results of the subjects' ratings regarding the practicability of the devices indicated highly significant differences among the EEG devices (χ26=83.2, n=24; P<.001). Ranking order and posthoc tests offered more insight and indicated that pin electrodes had the lowest wearing comfort, in particular, when coupled with a rigid, heavy headset. Finally, multiple linear regression for each device separately revealed that users were not willing to accept less comfort for a more attractive headset design.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study offers a differentiated look at emerging mobile and gel-free EEG technology and the relation between user experience aspects and device preference. Our research could be seen as a precondition for the development of usable applications with wearables and contributes to consumer health informatics and health-enabling technologies. Furthermore, our results provided guidance for the technological development direction of new EEG devices related to the aspects of emotional design.",3
574,Talking to Toddlers: Drawing on Mothers' Perceptions of Using Wearable and Mobile Technology in the Home,"Background:
        
      
      Mother-child interactions often give rise to opportunities for early language learning in the context of everyday life. Persuasive technology has the potential to influence maternal language behaviours in the home and promote mothers' active engagement in the development of their children's communication skills.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      This paper explored maternal perceptions regarding the use of a language tracking wearable (Language Environment Analysis; LENA) device and a parent education smartphone application in an 8-week trial with their young children.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Mother/child dyads were enrolled in a feasibility trial designed to obtain objective auditory and linguistic data from each child's naturalistic settings (Control Condition), provide feedback to mothers about their child's home language environment (LENA Feedback Condition), and to explore effectiveness of an app designed to promote meaningful parent/child interactions during daily routines (LENA Feedback and App Condition).
    


          Results and discussion:
        
      
      The majority of mothers (80%) who participated in the trial reported a preference for using the mobile app and/or LENA technology again. Maternal responses during this pilot informed the design of an ongoing, prospective language intervention study for parents and their young children with significant hearing loss.",1
575,Effect of Fitbit and iPad Wearable Technology in Health-Related Quality of Life in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients,"Purpose:
        
      
      Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer face significant challenges with regard to fatigue, reduced physical activity, and social isolation, which may negatively impact quality of life. This study investigated whether the use of digital wearable technology (Fitbits, along with synced iPads) can affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in AYA aged patients with cancer.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This was a prospective cohort study that offered Fitbits and iPads to all AYA patients aged 15 to 29 at an academic medical center at the time of cancer diagnosis. Patients completed the Short Form Health Survey developed by RAND (RAND-36) assessing eight dimensions of HRQOL on entering the study and at the time of their 6-month follow-up or the end of treatment, whichever occurred first. At the time of follow-up, patients also completed a questionnaire that assessed user experience, including frequency of wearable device use, enjoyment, challenges, and participation, in online communities.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-three patients participated in the study. Most patients reported enjoying the digital technology and using the devices to track multiple aspects of their health (85%). Most also reported a subjective increase in physical activity (79%). After the intervention, participants demonstrated significant improvements across all eight dimensions of HRQOL measured by the RAND-36 (p < 0.00 to 0.01).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Distributing wearable technology at the time of diagnosis may provide an avenue for improving HRQOL in adolescents and young adults with cancer.",6
576,The Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents (Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations,"Background:
        
      
      Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality-based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.",3
577,Benchmarking occupational exoskeletons: An evidence mapping systematic review,"Objectives:
        
      
      To provide an overview of protocols assessing the effect of occupational exoskeletons on users and to formulate recommendations towards a literature-based assessment framework to benchmark the effect of occupational exoskeletons on the user.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science database and Scopus were searched (March 2, 2021). Studies were included if they investigated the effect of one or more occupational exoskeletons on the user.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 139 eligible studies were identified, encompassing 33, 25 and 18 unique back, shoulder and other exoskeletons, respectively. Device validation was most frequently conducted using controlled tasks while collecting muscle activity and biomechanical data. As the exoskeleton concept matures, tasks became more applied and the experimental design more representative. With that change towards realistic testing environments came a trade-off with experimental control, and user experience data became more valuable.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This evidence mapping systematic review reveals that the assessment of occupational exoskeletons is a dynamic process, and provides literature-based assessment recommendations. The homogeneity and repeatability of future exoskeleton assessment experiments will increase following these recommendations. The current review recognises the value of variability in evaluation protocols in order to obtain an overall overview of the effect of exoskeletons on the users, but the presented framework strives to facilitate benchmarking the effect of occupational exoskeletons on the users across this variety of assessment protocols.",3

Sport applications are all about providing better user experience during workout sessions or professional gameplays.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The most important challenges regarding design and development of wearable devices and the computation burden of using AI methods are presented. Finally, future challenges and opportunities for wearable devices are presented.",2
579,Personalized Tracking of Physical Activity in Children Using a Wearable Heart Rate Monitor,"Serious games are video games that are intended to support learning while entertaining. They are considered valuable tools to improve user-specific skills or facilitate educational or therapeutic processes, especially in children. One of the disadvantages of computer games, in general, is their promotion of sedentary habits, considered as a significant risk factor for developing diseases such as obesity and hypertension. Exergames are serious games created to overcome the disadvantages of traditional computer games by promoting physical activity while playing. This study describes the development and evaluation of an adaptive component to monitor physical activity in children while using an exergame. The system is based on wearable technology to measure heart rate and perform real-time customizations in the exergame. To evaluate the adaptive component, an experiment was conducted with 30 children between 5 and 7 years of age, where the adaptive system was contrasted with a conventional interactive system (an exergame without adaptive component). It was demonstrated that the computer game, using the adaptive component, was able to change in real-time some of its functionalities based on the user characteristics. Increased levels of heart rate and caloric expenditure were significant in some of the game scenarios using the adaptive component. Although a formal user experience evaluation was not performed, excellent game playability and adherence by users were observed.",0
580,Older adults' experiences of using a wearable activity tracker with health professional feedback over a 12-month randomised controlled trial,"Objective:
        
      
      Wearable activity trackers can help older adults remain physically active. However, knowledge of the user experience during long-term use is scarce. Therefore, this study examined older adults' experiences with, and perceptions of, wearable activity trackers combined with health professional feedback after a year's use as part of a randomised controlled trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty older adults (73.6 ± 5.5 years) who had used a Jawbone UP24 activity tracker for 12 months during a randomised controlled trial were recruited for this study. All participants had at least one chronic condition. Acceptability data relating to activity tracker wear time was combined with focus group data to explore participants experiences of long-term activity tracker use. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The activity tracker was well-accepted with the device worn on an average of 86% of possible days and participants reported an overall positive experience. Four themes were identified: (a) increased sense of awareness of activity levels is related to motivation; (b) the level of engagement with the activity tracker influences the user experience; (c) the role of feedback from a health professional in providing ongoing support; d) the role of habits in supporting long-term behaviour change.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of an activity tracker combined with health professional support can assist older adults to maintain their activity levels over 12 months. Consideration should be given to the previous technology experience of users and the design and accuracy of an activity tracker when recommending their use in a research or clinical setting.",3
581,Feasibility of smart wristbands for continuous monitoring during pregnancy and one month after birth,"Background:
        
      
      Smart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n = 20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.",2
582,Neuro-cognitive assessment of intentional control methods for a soft elbow exosuit using error-related potentials,"Soft exosuits offer promise to support users in everyday workload tasks by providing assistance. However, acceptance of such systems remains low due to the difficulty of control compared with rigid mechatronic systems. Recently, there has been progress in developing control schemes for soft exosuits that move in line with user intentions. While initial results have demonstrated sufficient device performance, the assessment of user experience via the cognitive response has yet to be evaluated. To address this, we propose a soft pneumatic elbow exosuit designed based on our previous work to provide assistance in line with user expectations utilizing two existing state-of-the-art control methods consisting of a gravity compensation and myoprocessor based on muscle activation. A user experience study was conducted to assess whether the device moves naturally with user expectations and the potential for device acceptance by determining when the exosuit violated user expectations through the neuro-cognitive and motor response. Brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) data revealed that subjects elicited error-related potentials (ErrPs) in response to unexpected exosuit actions, which were decodable across both control schemes with an average accuracy of 76.63 ± 1.73% across subjects. Additionally, unexpected exosuit actions were further decoded via the motor response from electromyography (EMG) and kinematic data with a grand average accuracy of 68.73 ± 6.83% and 77.52 ± 3.79% respectively. This work demonstrates the validation of existing state-of-the-art control schemes for soft wearable exosuits through the proposed soft pneumatic elbow exosuit. We demonstrate the feasibility of assessing device performance with respect to the cognitive response through decoding when the device violates user expectations in order to help understand and promote device acceptance.",0
583,"DigiPrEP: A Pilot Trial to Evaluate the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Accuracy of a Digital Pill System to Measure PrEP Adherence in Men Who Have Sex With Men Who Use Substances","Background:
        
      
      Adherence to once daily oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention can be challenging for men who have sex with men (MSM) with substance use. Digital pill systems (DPS) comprise a radiofrequency emitter integrated into a gelatin capsule containing PrEP, which transmits data to a wearable Reader following ingestion, thereby enabling direct, real-time adherence measurement. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy of a DPS to measure PrEP adherence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 90-day, single-arm, open-label, pilot demonstration trial was conducted with adult, cisgender, HIV-negative MSM on PrEP with nonalcohol substance use. Feasibility was measured via DPS engagement and timeline followback. Acceptability was assessed via qualitative user experience interviews. Accuracy was evaluated via DPS performance metrics, pill counts, and DBS to quantify tenofovir diphosphate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixteen MSM enrolled (median age, 32 years), and 15 completed the study. Engagement remained stable over time. Emergent nonadherence patterns included intercurrent substance use. The DPS was largely acceptable based on interviews; the predominant barrier to use was the Reader. DPS-recorded ingestions totaled 1099, including 83.9% were detected by Reader and 16.1% were reported manually. The DPS recorded 92.2% of 1192 total expected ingestions per pill counts. Point-biserial correlation (R = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.80; P = 0.047) and Pearson correlation (month 1: R = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.95; P = 0.0002; month 3: R = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.94; P = 0.0197) showed strong correlations between DPS-recorded adherence and tenofovir diphosphate in dried blood spots.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      DPS are a feasible, acceptable, and accurate method of measuring PrEP adherence in MSM with substance use. Future investigations should incorporate DPS into behavioral interventions targeting nonadherence.",8
584,"Design of a Low-Cost, Wearable Device for Kinematic Analysis in Physical Therapy Settings","Background:
        
      
      Unsupervised home exercise is a major component of physical therapy (PT). This study proposes an inexpensive, inertial measurement unit-based wearable device to capture kinematic data to facilitate exercise. However, conveying and interpreting kinematic data to non-experts poses a challenge due to the complexity and background knowledge required that most patients lack.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objectives of this study were to identify key user interface and user experience features that would likely improve device adoption and assess participant receptiveness toward the device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty participants were recruited to perform nine upper extremity exercises while wearing the device. Prior to exercise, participants completed an orientation of the device, which included examples of software graphics with exercise data. Surveys that measured receptiveness toward the device, software graphics, and ergonomics were given before and after exercise.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants were highly receptive to the device with 90% of the participants likely to use the device during PT. Participants understood how the simple kinematic data could be used to aid exercise, but the data could be difficult to comprehend with more complex movements. Devices should incorporate wireless sensors and emphasize ease of wear.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Device-guided home physical rehabilitation can allow for individualized treatment protocols and improve exercise self-efficacy through kinematic analysis. Future studies should implement clinical testing to evaluate the impact a wearable device can have on rehabilitation outcomes.",3
585,Quantifying physical activity in early Parkinson disease using a commercial activity monitor,"Introduction:
        
      
      Physical inactivity in Parkinson disease (PD) has an impact on motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease. It is unclear whether this decline in physical activity occurs early in the disease, in addition to any decline due to aging, and whether commercial activity monitors can be used to self-monitor physical activity levels in this population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the quantity and intensity of physical activity (PA), as measured by commercial activity monitors, in people with mild PD and healthy older adults (HOA). A secondary objective was to assess adherence and user experience with wearing the activity monitoring device.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An observational descriptive study design examined PA levels over a 14-day period using commercially-available activity monitors (Fitbit Charge HR).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Individuals with PD (n = 30) and HOA (n = 30) both demonstrated high adherence with wear time (PD = 13.8 [0.5] days, HOA = 13.9 [0.4] days, p = 0.55). People with PD took fewer steps per day than HOA (PD = 6416.9 (2795.5), HOA = 11441.3 (3932.1), p < 0.001). Compared to HOA, individuals with PD spent fewer minutes per day engaged in moderate to vigorous intensity activity (PD = 33.0 (22.5), HOA = 72.0(37.3), p < 0.001) and more minutes per day sedentary (PD = 803.74 (154.9), HOA = 578.26 (103.7), p < 0.001). Both groups reported that ease of use and satisfaction with the activity monitor were high.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      People with mild PD demonstrated reduced quantity and intensity of PA compared to HOA. Both the PD and the HOA groups had good adherence wearing a commercial activity monitor that provided feedback regarding activity levels.",1
586,"""Listen to Your Immune System When It's Calling for You"": Monitoring Autoimmune Diseases Using the iShU App","The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions.",2
587,"Connected Through Mediated Social Touch: "" Better Than a Like on Facebook."" A Longitudinal Explorative Field Study Among Geographically Separated Romantic Couples","In recent years, there has been a significant increase in research on mediated communication via social touch. Previous studies indicated that mediated social touch (MST) can induce similar positive outcomes to interpersonal touch. However, studies investigating the user experience of MST technology predominantly involve brief experiments that are performed in well-controlled laboratory conditions. Hence, it is still unknown how MST affects the relationship and communication between physically separated partners in a romantic relationship, in a naturalistic setting and over a longer period of time. In a longitudinal explorative field study, the effects of MST on social connectedness and longing for touch among geographically separated romantic couples were investigated in a naturalistic setting. For 2 weeks, 17 couples used haptic bracelets, that were connected via the internet, to exchange mediated squeeze-like touch signals. Before and after this period, they reported their feelings of social connectedness and longing for touch through questionnaires. The results show that the use of haptic bracelets (1) enhanced social connectedness among geographically separated couples but (2) did not affect their longing for touch. Interviews conducted at the end of the study were analyzed following the thematic analysis method to generate prominent themes and patterns in using MST technology among participant couples. Two main themes were generated that captured (a) the way the bracelets fostered a positive one-to-one connection between partners and (b) the way in which participants worked around their frustrations with the bracelets. Detailed findings and limitations of this longitudinal field study are further discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.",9
588,Establishing a Global Standard for Wearable Devices in Sport and Fitness: Perspectives from the New England Chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine Members,"The recent explosion of wearable technology and the associated concerns prompted the International Federation of Sports Medicine (FIMS) to create a quality assurance standard for wearable devices, which provides commissioned testing of marketing claims and endorsement of commercial wearables that test favorably. An open forum as announced in the conference advertising was held at the Annual Meeting of the New England Regional Chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine (NEACSM) November 7 to 8, 2019, in Providence, Rhode Island, USA for attending NEACSM members to voice their input on the process. Herein, we report the proceedings. The round table participants perceived the quality assurance standard to be important, but identified some practical process challenges that included the broad scope and complexity of the device universe, the need for a multiphase testing pathway, and the associated fees for product evaluation. The participants also supported the evaluation of device data analysis, behavioral influences, and user experience in the overall evaluation. Looking forward, the FIMS quality assurance standard faces the challenge of balancing these broader perspectives with practical constraints of budget, facilities, time, and human resources.",4
589,An intervention study to assess potential effect and user experience of an mHealth intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour among older office workers,"Background:
        
      
      Office workers spend a high percentage of their time sitting, often in long periods of time. Research suggests that it is healthier to break these long bouts into shorter periods by being physically active.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We evaluated the effect of a context-aware activity coach, called the PEARL app, an mHealth intervention that provides activity suggestions, based on a physical activity prediction model, consisting of past and current physical activity and digital agendas.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Fifteen office workers, aged 50+, participated in an intervention study in which they used the intervention for 1 week, preceded by a 1-week baseline period. Measurements were taken before and after the intervention period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      107 days of data from 14 participants were analysed. Total sedentary time was not reduced as a result of using the intervention (baseline vs intervention: 47.8±3.6 vs 46.8±3.0, n.s.). When using the intervention, participants reduced their total time spent in long sitting bouts (≥45 min) from 19.3 to 14.4 min per hour of wear time (p<0.05). Participants indicated that the main value of the intervention lies in creating awareness about their personal sedentary behaviour pattern.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An mHealth service has the potential to improve the sedentary behaviour of older office workers, especially for breaking up long sedentary periods. Focusing on total sedentary time as an outcome of an intervention, aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour, is too simplistic. One should take into account both the duration and the number of bouts when determining the effect.",3
590,"Factors Influencing Motivation and Engagement in Mobile Health Among Patients With Sickle Cell Disease in Low-Prevalence, High-Income Countries: Qualitative Exploration of Patient Requirements","Background:
        
      
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological genetic disease affecting over 25 million people worldwide. The main clinical manifestations of SCD, hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion, lead to chronic pain and organ damages. With recent advances in childhood care, high-income countries have seen SCD drift from a disease of early childhood mortality to a neglected chronic disease of adulthood. In particular, coordinated, preventive, and comprehensive care for adults with SCD is largely underresourced. Consequently, patients are left to self-manage. Mobile health (mHealth) apps for chronic disease self-management are now flooding app stores. However, evidence remains unclear about their effectiveness, and the literature indicates low user engagement and poor adoption rates. Finally, few apps have been developed for people with SCD and none encompasses their numerous and complex self-care management needs.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to identify factors that may influence the long-term engagement and user adoption of mHealth among the particularly isolated community of adult patients with SCD living in low-prevalence, high-income countries.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Semistructured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Analysis was informed by the Braun and Clarke framework and mapped to the COM-B model (capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior). Results were classified into high-level functional requirements (FRs) and nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) to guide the development of future mHealth interventions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 6 males and 4 females were interviewed (aged between 21 and 55 years). Thirty FRs and 31 NFRs were extracted from the analysis. Most participants (8/10) were concerned about increasing their physical capabilities being able to stop pain symptoms quickly. Regarding the psychological capability aspects, all interviewees desired to receive trustworthy feedback on their self-care management practices. About their physical opportunities, most (7/10) expressed a strong desire to receive alerts when they would reach their own physiological limitations (ie, during physical activity). Concerning social opportunity, most (9/10) reported wanting to learn about the self-care practices of other patients. Relating to motivational aspects, many interviewees (6/10) stressed their need to learn how to avoid the symptoms and live as normal a life as possible. Finally, NFRs included inconspicuousness and customizability of user experience, automatic data collection, data shareability, and data privacy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that motivation and engagement with mHealth technologies among the studied population could be increased by providing features that clearly benefit them. Self-management support and self-care decision aid are patients' major demands. As the complexity of SCD self-management requires a high cognitive load, pervasive health technologies such as wearable sensors, implantable devices, or inconspicuous conversational user interfaces should be explored to ease it. Some of the required technologies already exist but must be integrated, bundled, adapted, or improved to meet the specific needs of people with SCD.",2
591,Physical activity evaluation in children with congenital heart disease,"Significant advances in the management of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have resulted in marked improvements in survival and life expectancy. Thus, there is an increased emphasis on promoting physical activity to optimise healthy development and long-term cardiovascular health. Evaluation of physical activity levels as part of ongoing clinical care is recommended to facilitate physical activity counselling and/or exercise prescription. Physical activity is a complex health behaviour that is challenging to evaluate. We provide an overview of techniques for measuring physical activity in children with CHD with a focus on how to do this in the clinical context. Accelerometers are devices that objectively assess intensity and duration of physical activity under free living conditions. They enable evaluation against physical activity guidelines, but are costly and require advanced technical expertise. Pedometers are a simple-to-use and cost-effective alternative, but an outcome metric of daily step count limits classification against guidelines. Commercial wearable activity trackers offer an appealing user experience and can provide valid estimates in children. Furthermore, activity trackers enable remote monitoring of physical activity levels, which may facilitate exercise prescription and activity counselling. Questionnaires are the most cost-effective and time-effective method, but recall error in younger children is a consideration. Routine exercise testing in children with CHD provides important insight into functional status but should not be viewed as a proxy measure of habitual physical activity. Understanding the spectrum and role of physical activity measurement tools is important for clinicians focused on optimising cardiovascular health in children with CHD.",1
592,A Wearable Sensor System for Physical Ergonomics Interventions Using Haptic Feedback,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major concern globally affecting societies, companies, and individuals. To address this, a new sensor-based system is presented: the Smart Workwear System, aimed at facilitating preventive measures by supporting risk assessments, work design, and work technique training. The system has a module-based platform that enables flexibility of sensor-type utilization, depending on the specific application. A module of the Smart Workwear System that utilizes haptic feedback for work technique training is further presented and evaluated in simulated mail sorting on sixteen novice participants for its potential to reduce adverse arm movements and postures in repetitive manual handling. Upper-arm postures were recorded, using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), perceived pain/discomfort with the Borg CR10-scale, and user experience with a semi-structured interview. This study shows that the use of haptic feedback for work technique training has the potential to significantly reduce the time in adverse upper-arm postures after short periods of training. The haptic feedback was experienced positive and usable by the participants and was effective in supporting learning of how to improve postures and movements. It is concluded that this type of sensorized system, using haptic feedback training, is promising for the future, especially when organizations are introducing newly employed staff, when teaching ergonomics to employees in physically demanding jobs, and when performing ergonomics interventions.",7
593,Continuous 24-h Photoplethysmogram Monitoring Enables Detection of Atrial Fibrillation,"Aim: Atrial fibrillation (AF) detection is challenging because it is often asymptomatic and paroxysmal. We evaluated continuous photoplethysmogram (PPG) for signal quality and detection of AF. Methods: PPGs were recorded using a wrist-band device in 173 patients (76 AF, 97 sinus rhythm, SR) for 24 h. Simultaneously recorded 3-lead ambulatory ECG served as control. The recordings were split into 10-, 20-, 30-, and 60-min time-frames. The sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of AF detection were evaluated for each time-frame. AF alarms were generated to simulate continuous AF monitoring. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values (PPVs) of the alarms were evaluated. User experiences of PPG and ECG recordings were assessed. The study was registered in the Clinical Trials database (NCT03507335). Results: The quality of PPG signal was better during night-time than in daytime (67.3 ± 22.4% vs. 30.5 ± 19.4%, p < 0.001). The 30-min time-frame yielded the highest F1-score (0.9536), identifying AF correctly in 72/76 AF patients (sensitivity 94.7%), only 3/97 SR patients receiving a false AF diagnosis (specificity 96.9%). The sensitivity and PPV of the simulated AF alarms were 78.2 and 97.2% at night, and 49.3 and 97.0% during the daytime. 82% of patients were willing to use the device at home. Conclusion: PPG wrist-band provided reliable AF identification both during daytime and night-time. The PPG data's quality was better at night. The positive user experience suggests that wearable PPG devices could be feasible for continuous rhythm monitoring.",9
594,Accuracy of remote chest X-ray interpretation using Google Glass technology,"Objectives:
        
      
      We sought to explore the accuracy of remote chest X-ray reading using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass, Google, Mountain View, California).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We compared interpretation of twelve chest X-rays with 23 major cardiopulmonary findings by faculty and fellows from cardiology, radiology, and pulmonary-critical care via: (1) viewing the chest X-ray image on the Google Glass screen; (2) viewing a photograph of the chest X-ray taken using Google Glass and interpreted on a mobile device; (3) viewing the original chest X-ray on a desktop computer screen. One point was given for identification of each correct finding and a subjective rating of user experience was recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen physicians (5 faculty and 10 fellows) participated. The average chest X-ray reading score (maximum 23 points) as viewed through the Google Glass, Google Glass photograph on a mobile device, and the original X-ray viewed on a desktop computer was 14.1±2.2, 18.5±1.5 and 21.3±1.7, respectively (p<0.0001 between Google Glass and mobile device, p<0.0001 between Google Glass and desktop computer and p=0.0004 between mobile device and desktop computer). Of 15 physicians, 11 (73.3%) felt confident in detecting findings using the photograph taken by Google Glass as viewed on a mobile device.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Remote chest X-ray interpretation using hands-free, wearable technology (Google Glass) is less accurate than interpretation using a desktop computer or a mobile device, suggesting that further technical improvements are needed before widespread application of this novel technology.",6
595,Feasibility of a Sensor-Based Technological Platform in Assessing Gait and Sleep of In-Hospital Stroke and Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (iSCI) Patients,"Recovery of the walking function is one of the most common rehabilitation goals of neurological patients. Sufficient and adequate sleep is a prerequisite for recovery or training. To objectively monitor patients' progress, a combination of different sensors measuring continuously over time is needed. A sensor-based technological platform offers possibilities to monitor gait and sleep. Implementation in clinical practice is of utmost relevance and has scarcely been studied. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of a sensor-based technological platform within the clinical setting. Participants (12 incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), 13 stroke) were asked to wear inertial measurement units (IMUs) around the ankles during daytime and the bed sensor was placed under their mattress for one week. Feasibility was established based on missing data, error cause, and user experience. Percentage of missing measurement days and nights was 14% and 4%, respectively. Main cause of lost measurement days was related to missing IMU sensor data. Participants were not impeded, did not experience any discomfort, and found the sensors easy to use. The sensor-based technological platform is feasible to use within the clinical rehabilitation setting for continuously monitoring gait and sleep of iSCI and stroke patients.",0
596,Electrodeless Heart and Respiratory Rate Estimation during Sleep Using a Single Fabric Band and Event-Based Edge Processing,"Heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) are two vital parameters of the body medically used for diagnosing short/long-term illness. Out-of-the-body, non-skin-contact HR/RR measurement remains a challenge due to imprecise readings. ""Invisible"" wearables integrated into day-to-day garments have the potential to produce precise readings with a comfortable user experience. Sleep studies and patient monitoring benefit from ""Invisibles"" due to longer wearability without significant discomfort. This paper suggests a novel method to reduce the footprint of sleep monitoring devices. We use a single silver-coated nylon fabric band integrated into a substrate of a standard cotton/nylon garment as a resistive elastomer sensor to measure air and blood volume change across the chest. We introduce a novel event-based architecture to process data at the edge device and describe two algorithms to calculate real-time HR/RR on ARM Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4F microcontrollers. RR estimations show a sensitivity of 99.03% and a precision of 99.03% for identifying individual respiratory peaks. The two algorithms used for HR calculation show a mean absolute error of 0.81 ± 0.97 and 0.86±0.61 beats/min compared with a gold standard ECG-based HR. The event-based algorithm converts the respiratory/pulse waveform into instantaneous events, therefore reducing the data size by 40-140 times and requiring 33% less power to process and transfer data. Furthermore, we show that events hold enough information to reconstruct the original waveform, retaining pulse and respiratory activity. We suggest fabric sensors and event-based algorithms would drastically reduce the device footprint and increase the performance for HR/RR estimations during sleep studies, providing a better user experience.",0
597,Objective Monitoring of Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy During Clinical Trials Using a Smartphone App and Wearables: Observational Study,"Background:
        
      
      Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscle dystrophy disorder leading to significant disability. Currently, FSHD symptom severity is assessed by clinical assessments such as the FSHD clinical score and the Timed Up-and-Go test. These assessments are limited in their ability to capture changes continuously and the full impact of the disease on patients' quality of life. Real-world data related to physical activity, sleep, and social behavior could potentially provide additional insight into the impact of the disease and might be useful in assessing treatment effects on aspects that are important contributors to the functioning and well-being of patients with FSHD.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study investigated the feasibility of using smartphones and wearables to capture symptoms related to FSHD based on a continuous collection of multiple features, such as the number of steps, sleep, and app use. We also identified features that can be used to differentiate between patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this exploratory noninterventional study, 58 participants (n=38, 66%, patients with FSHD and n=20, 34%, non-FSHD controls) were monitored using a smartphone monitoring app for 6 weeks. On the first and last day of the study period, clinicians assessed the participants' FSHD clinical score and Timed Up-and-Go test time. Participants installed the app on their Android smartphones, were given a smartwatch, and were instructed to measure their weight and blood pressure on a weekly basis using a scale and blood pressure monitor. The user experience and perceived burden of the app on participants' smartphones were assessed at 6 weeks using a questionnaire. With the data collected, we sought to identify the behavioral features that were most salient in distinguishing the 2 groups (patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls) and the optimal time window to perform the classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, the participants stated that the app was well tolerated, but 67% (39/58) noticed a difference in battery life using all 6 weeks of data, we classified patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls with 93% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. We found that the optimal time window for the classification is the first day of data collection and the first week of data collection, which yielded an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.8%, 100%, and 94.4%, respectively. Features relating to smartphone acceleration, app use, location, physical activity, sleep, and call behavior were the most salient features for the classification.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remotely monitored data collection allowed for the collection of daily activity data in patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls for 6 weeks. We demonstrated the initial ability to detect differences in features in patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls using smartphones and wearables, mainly based on data related to physical and social activity.

598,A Brief Training Program to Support the Use of a Digital Pill System for Medication Adherence: Pilot Descriptive Study,"Background:
        
      
      Digital pill systems (DPSs), which comprise ingestible radiofrequency sensors integrated into a gelatin capsule that overencapsulates a medication, can directly measure ingestion events.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Teaching users to operate a DPS is vital to ensure the collection of actionable ingestion and adherence data. In this study, we aim to develop and pilot a training program, grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, to instruct individuals on DPS operation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A two-part training program, comprising in-person and text message-based components, was used with HIV-negative men who have sex with men with nonalcohol substance use, who had enrolled in a 90-day pilot demonstration study using the DPS to measure adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis. We assessed the number of responses to text check-ins, the number and types of episodes where technical support was requested, the resolutions of such issues, and engagement with the program over the study period. Participant feedback on the program was evaluated through qualitative user experience interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 15 participants were enrolled in and completed the program. Seven technical challenges related to DPS operations were reported across 5 participants. Most commonly, participants requested support connecting the wearable Reader device with their smartphone, charging the Reader, and operating the mobile app. A total of 6 issues were resolved asynchronously or in real time via phone; 1 required in-person evaluation and resolution. Preliminary qualitative findings indicate that both the in-person and remote follow-up components of the training program were perceived as acceptable. Suggested improvements included repeated DPS refresher sessions at in-person follow-up visits and enhanced written materials for the independent resolution of technological issues.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A brief two-part DPS training program, drawing from individuals' experiences and from the Technology Acceptance Model, can provide valuable insights for users. The program also identifies and addresses several areas of actual or potential challenges related to operating a DPS and allows for the resolution of such issues within the first week of DPS use.",4
599,Older Adults' and Clinicians' Perspectives on a Smart Health Platform for the Aging Population: Design and Evaluation Study,"Background:
        
      
      Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users' needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults' and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions.",2
600,Using Fitness Trackers and Smartwatches to Measure Physical Activity in Research: Analysis of Consumer Wrist-Worn Wearables,"Background:
        
      
      New fitness trackers and smartwatches are released to the consumer market every year. These devices are equipped with different sensors, algorithms, and accompanying mobile apps. With recent advances in mobile sensor technology, privately collected physical activity data can be used as an addition to existing methods for health data collection in research. Furthermore, data collected from these devices have possible applications in patient diagnostics and treatment. With an increasing number of diverse brands, there is a need for an overview of device sensor support, as well as device applicability in research projects.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to examine the availability of wrist-worn fitness wearables and analyze availability of relevant fitness sensors from 2011 to 2017. Furthermore, the study was designed to assess brand usage in research projects, compare common brands in terms of developer access to collected health data, and features to consider when deciding which brand to use in future research.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched for devices and brand names in six wearable device databases. For each brand, we identified additional devices on official brand websites. The search was limited to wrist-worn fitness wearables with accelerometers, for which we mapped brand, release year, and supported sensors relevant for fitness tracking. In addition, we conducted a Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and ClinicalTrials search to determine brand usage in research projects. Finally, we investigated developer accessibility to the health data collected by identified brands.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 423 unique devices from 132 different brands. Forty-seven percent of brands released only one device. Introduction of new brands peaked in 2014, and the highest number of new devices was introduced in 2015. Sensor support increased every year, and in addition to the accelerometer, a photoplethysmograph, for estimating heart rate, was the most common sensor. Out of the brands currently available, the five most often used in research projects are Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit, Apple, and Polar. Fitbit is used in twice as many validation studies as any other brands and is registered in ClinicalTrials studies 10 times as often as other brands.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The wearable landscape is in constant change. New devices and brands are released every year, promising improved measurements and user experience. At the same time, other brands disappear from the consumer market for various reasons. Advances in device quality offer new opportunities for research. However, only a few well-established brands are frequently used in research projects, and even less are thoroughly validated.",6
601,Health Promotion for Childhood Obesity: An Approach Based on Self-Tracking of Data,"At present, obesity and overweight are a global health epidemic. Traditional interventions for promoting healthy habits do not appear to be effective. However, emerging technological solutions based on wearables and mobile devices can be useful in promoting healthy habits. These applications generate a considerable amount of tracked activity data. Consequently, our approach is based on the quantified-self model for recommending healthy activities. Gamification can also be used as a mechanism to enhance personalization, increasing user motivation. This paper describes the quantified-self model and its data sources, the activity recommender system, and the PROVITAO App user experience model. Furthermore, it presents the results of a gamified program applied for three years in children with obesity and the process of evaluating the quantified-self model with experts. Positive outcomes were obtained in children's medical parameters and health habits.",0
602,Patients self-mastery of wearable devices for seizure detection: A direct user-experience,"Purpose:
        
      
      wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device.
    


          Method:
        
      
      patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0-12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological solutions are delivered to users.",6
