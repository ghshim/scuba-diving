Mapping reef fish and the seascape: using acoustics and spatial modeling to guide coastal management,"Bryan Costa, J Christopher Taylor, Laura Kracker, Tim Battista, Simon Pittman, Bryan Costa, J Christopher Taylor, Laura Kracker, Tim Battista, Simon Pittman",2014 Jan 15,"Reef fish distributions are patchy in time and space with some coral reef habitats supporting higher densities (i.e., aggregations) of fish than others. Identifying and quantifying fish aggregations (particularly during spawning events) are often top priorities for coastal managers. However, the rapid mapping of these aggregations using conventional survey methods (e.g., non-technical SCUBA diving and remotely operated cameras) are limited by depth, visibility and time. Acoustic sensors (i.e., splitbeam and multibeam echosounders) are not constrained by these same limitations, and were used to concurrently map and quantify the location, density and size of reef fish along with seafloor structure in two, separate locations in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Reef fish aggregations were documented along the shelf edge, an ecologically important ecotone in the region. Fish were grouped into three classes according to body size, and relationships with the benthic seascape were modeled in one area using Boosted Regression Trees. These models were validated in a second area to test their predictive performance in locations where fish have not been mapped. Models predicting the density of large fish (≥ 29 cm) performed well (i.e., AUC = 0.77). Water depth and standard deviation of depth were the most influential predictors at two spatial scales (100 and 300 m). Models of small (≤ 11 cm) and medium (12-28 cm) fish performed poorly (i.e., AUC = 0.49 to 0.68) due to the high prevalence (45-79%) of smaller fish in both locations, and the unequal prevalence of smaller fish in the training and validation areas. Integrating acoustic sensors with spatial modeling offers a new and reliable approach to rapidly identify fish aggregations and to predict the density large fish in un-surveyed locations. This integrative approach will help coastal managers to prioritize sites, and focus their limited resources on areas that may be of higher conservation value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24454886/,2022-11-19 11:48:45 PM
SCUBA Diving and Asthma: Clinical Recommendations and Safety,"Christopher A Coop, Karla E Adams, Charles N Webb, Christopher A Coop, Karla E Adams, Charles N Webb",2016 Feb,"The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding asthma and SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed articles related to asthma and SCUBA diving using the following keywords: asthma, allergy, and SCUBA diving. SCUBA diving is a popular sport with more than 9 million divers in the USA. SCUBA diving can be a dangerous sport. Bronchospasm can develop in asthmatic patients and cause airway obstruction. Airway obstruction may be localized to the distal airway which prevents gas elimination. Uncontrolled expansion of the distal airway may result in pulmonary barotrauma. There is also the risk of a gas embolism. Asthmatic divers can also aspirate seawater which may induce bronchospasm. Pollen contamination of their oxygen tank may exacerbate atopic asthma in patients. Diving may be hazardous to the lung function of patients with asthma. Despite the risks of SCUBA diving, many asthmatic individuals can dive without serious diving events. Diving evaluations for asthmatic patients have focused on a thorough patient history, spirometry, allergy testing, and bronchial challenges. For patients that wish to dive, their asthma should be well controlled without current chest symptoms. Patients should have a normal spirometry. Some diving societies recommend that an asthmatic patient should successfully pass a bronchial provocation challenge. Recommendations also state that exercise-, emotion-, and cold-induced asthmatics should not dive. Asthmatic patients requiring rescue medication within 48 h should not dive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25666876/,2022-11-19 11:48:49 PM
Diving with pre-existing medical conditions,"John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Jo Williams, Simon J Mitchell, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Jo Williams, Simon J Mitchell",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      This is the second report based on a survey of Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) members who dive with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and diabetes. It examines the medical management of the divers' conditions, any diving modifications used to mitigate the risk and outcomes.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      An online cross-sectional survey was sent to 833 divers who had declared a targeted medical condition when applying for DAN AP membership between July 2009 and August 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two-hundred-and-sixty-eight respondents (32%) provided sufficient information on their conditions to be included in the analyses. These included ischaemic heart disease (31), arrhythmias (20), cardiac septal defects (31), other cardiac conditions (10), hypertension (127), diabetes (25), asthma (40) and pneumothorax (5). Forty-nine per cent had sought specialist diving medical advice about their condition and 23% reported modifying their diving practices to mitigate their risk. The cohort had completed 183,069 career dives, 57,822 of these since being diagnosed with their medical condition. There were 27 individuals who reported having decompression illness (25 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with a persistent foramen ovale), and two individuals who experienced an arrhythmia during diving.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Some DAN AP members are diving with medical conditions which could potentially impact the safety of their diving. A minority modified their diving practices to mitigate the risk of their condition and approximately half sought specialist diving medical advice. The incidence of diving-related problems precipitated by known and managed pre-existing health conditions seems low but further studies of larger cohorts and incorporating fatality data would be necessary to confirm this. These results are limited by the 32% response rate and potential for bias towards selection of those most careful with their health.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868599/,2022-11-19 11:48:50 PM
Continuous real-time monitoring and recording of glycemia during scuba diving: pilot study,"Massimo Pieri, Danilo Cialoni, Alessandro Marroni, Massimo Pieri, Danilo Cialoni, Alessandro Marroni",2016 May-Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Insulin-dependent diabetes has been considered a scuba diving contraindication. This is currently being reconsidered for well-controlled diabetes. We developed a real-time continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to check glycemia, or blood glucose (BG), during diving, both for prospective studies and to increase diabetic diver safety, allowing for real-time control of glycemia and hypoglycemia prevention. To ensure CGM measurement accuracy we tested the method under hyperbaric conditions.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Two experienced diabetic divers were studied during a one-week diving cruise. BG was monitored every five minutes on every dive, by a dedicated CGM, and values were visible to the divers throughout their dives. The mean of relative difference (MRD) between CGM and capillary blood glucose was calculated. Measurement accuracy was assessed according to ISO guideline 15197 and by Clarke Error Grid (CEG) analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both divers showed gradual BG decrease during diving. Hyperbaric chamber accuracy tests showed two of 26 MRD values (7.7%) slightly exceeding the ISO-15197 allowed difference (5%). However, our data suggest that this discrepancy may have been an artefact.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our data (even limited to two subjects only) agree with the current literature showing that also in our investigated subjects diving does not imply significant risks of hypoglycemia. The use of a real-time CGM by diabetic divers during their dives can provide immediate information on BG values and trends, thus significantly improving diving safety. The accuracy tests comparing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and capillary blood glucose measurement (CBM) data recorded under hyperbaric conditions showed that data recorded under pressure are very close to the ISO-15197 and CEG acceptable limits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27416695/,2022-11-19 11:48:51 PM
Orofacial problems in scuba diving: prevalence and prevention-a large-scale survey among civilian divers in France,"Paul-Alexandre Moyaux, Gabriel Fernandez de Grado, Anne-Marie Musset, Damien Offner, Paul-Alexandre Moyaux, Gabriel Fernandez de Grado, Anne-Marie Musset, Damien Offner",2022 Oct,"Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving is becoming widely democratized among hobbyist practitioners. It can cause orofacial problems, mostly linked to pressure changes. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of these problems and to analyze civilian divers' behavior about their dental prevention in France, via a cross-sectional study. Data from 1015 French civilian divers were collected via a nationwide online questionnaire in which participants indicated information concerning orofacial experienced problems during their diving activity, and their medical preventive habits. As results, oral manifestations were experienced by 25.2% of the divers, including barodontalgia (10.8%), mouth syndrome (13.4%), gum pain (2.8%) and dental fractures caused by barotrauma (3.7%) or shocks (1.9%). Mouth syndrome was more frequent among women (18.6%) and divers aged between 18 and 34 years (18.9%). The prevalence of dental fractures increased significantly with age. High diving level was associated with more frequent barodontalgia (17.5%), gum pain (7%) and barotrauma (7.6%). Among respondents, 43.5% completed a dental examination before a diving season and showed fewer oral problems during their scuba diving practice than those who did not. In conclusion, oral problems in scuba diving represent frequent events that can compromise the safety of divers. Despite awareness rising, there is a lack of recourse to the dentist. This leads to incomplete information, especially concerning the preventive means available to divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35637398/,2022-11-19 11:48:59 PM
The effect of using a pre-dive checklist on the incidence of diving mishaps in recreational scuba diving: a cluster-randomized trial,"Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Petar J Denoble, Charles Poole, Kristen L Kucera, Stephen W Marshall, Steve Wing, Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Petar J Denoble, Charles Poole, Kristen L Kucera, Stephen W Marshall, Steve Wing",2016 Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Scuba diving mishaps, caused by equipment problems or human errors, increase the occurrence of injuries and fatalities while diving. Pre-dive checklists may mitigate mishaps. This study evaluated the effect of using a pre-dive checklist on the incidence of diving mishaps in recreational divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multi-location cluster-randomized trial with parallel groups and allocation concealment was conducted between 1 June and 17 August 2012. The participants had to be at least 18 years of age, permitted to dive by the dive operator and planning to dive on the day of participation. They were recruited at the pier and dive boats at four locations. The intervention group received a pre-dive checklist and post-dive log. The control group received a post-dive log only. The outcomes, self-reported major and minor mishaps, were prompted by a post-dive questionnaire. Mishap rates per 100 dives were compared using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations. Intent-to-treat, per-protocol and marginal structural model analyses were conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1043 divers (intervention = 617; control = 426) made 2041 dives, on 70 location-days (intervention = 40; control = 30) at four locations. Compared with the control group, the incidence of major mishaps decreased in the intervention group by 36%, minor mishaps by 26% and all mishaps by 32%. On average, there was one fewer mishap in every 25 intervention dives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this trial, pre-dive checklist use prevented mishaps which could lead to injuries and fatalities. Pre-dive checklists can increase diving safety and their use should be promoted.

Safety of antimalarial medications for use while scuba diving in malaria Endemic Regions,"Kyle Petersen, David P Regis, Kyle Petersen, David P Regis",2016 Oct 11,"Background:
        
      
      Recreational diving occurs annually in areas of the world where malaria is endemic. The safety and efficacy of antimalarials for travelers in a hyperbaric environment is unknown. Of particular concern would be medications with adverse effects that could either mimic diving related illnesses such as barotrauma, decompression sickness (DCS) and gas toxicities, or increase the risk for such illnesses.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a review of PubMed and Cochrane databases to determine rates of neurologic adverse effects or other effects from antimalarials that may be a problem in the diving environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One case report was found on diving and mefloquine. Multiple case reports and clinical trials were found describing neurologic adverse effects of the major chemoprophylactic medications atovaquone/proguanil, chloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, and primaquine.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Of the available literature, atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline are most likely the safest agents and should be preferred; atovaquone/proguanil is superior due to reduced rates of sunburn in the marine environment. Primaquine also appears to be safe, but has reduced efficacy against P. falciparum; mefloquine possesses the highest rate of neurologic side effects and therefore these agents should be limited to extreme cases of patients intolerant to other agents. Chloroquine appears unsafe in the hyperbaric environment and should be avoided. More studies are required to include database reviews of returned divers traveling to malaria endemic areas and randomized controlled trials in the hyperbaric environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28883967/,2022-11-19 11:49:01 PM
SCUBA Diving in Pregnancy,"Robert L Reid, Melissa Lorenzo, Robert L Reid, Melissa Lorenzo",2018 Nov,"Objective:
        
      
      Obstetrical care providers may occasionally encounter women with questions about the safety of Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) diving in pregnancy. This article provides an overview of safety issues associated with basic SCUBA diving and offers guidance to practitioners about how to evaluate and counsel pregnant women about the associated maternal and fetal risks. Basic diving physiology is reviewed and the implications of SCUBA diving during pregnancy are discussed. A literature review examined available animal and human data about the potential adverse effects of the physiological changes of pregnancy on divers, the impact of pressure changes during diving, and possible consequences of hyperbaric gas exposure and rapid decompression on mother and fetus.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Studies were found by searching the terms ""scuba diving,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""fetus,"" ""decompression illness,"" ""hyperbaric medicine,"" and ""animal studies"" in the databases Medline, Pubmed, and Embase. Reference lists from existing articles and reports from identified diving magazines were also reviewed. Studies were limited to the English language and included publications until 2016.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      All relevant human studies were selected. Five retrospective studies and one prospective study assessing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of women who participated in SCUBA diving while pregnant were reviewed.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Published data was limited in both quantity and quality. The authors' experience with SCUBA diving together with a background in obstetrics allowed themes to be explored and recommendations developed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In addition to established risks of SCUBA diving, pregnant women are at increased risk due to changes in body habitus (affecting equipment fitting and balance). Animal data suggest possible adverse fetal effects due to fetal decompression illness (DCI) and hyperbaric oxygen exposure. Human data, though generally reassuring, are of poor quality and thus do not completely exclude adverse outcomes. In general, women should be cautioned to avoid diving during pregnancy, but inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29503252/,2022-11-19 11:49:09 PM
Full-Face Mask Use during SCUBA Diving Counters Related Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Dysfunction,"Morgan Levenez, Kate Lambrechts, Simona Mrakic-Sposta, Alessandra Vezzoli, Peter Germonpré, Hadrien Pique, Fabio Virgili, Gerardo Bosco, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, Morgan Levenez, Kate Lambrechts, Simona Mrakic-Sposta, Alessandra Vezzoli, Peter Germonpré, Hadrien Pique, Fabio Virgili, Gerardo Bosco, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra",2022 Jan 15,"Impaired flow mediated dilation (FMD), an index of vascular stress, is known after SCUBA diving. This is related to a dysfunction of nitric oxide (NO) availability and a disturbance of the redox status, possibly induced by hyperoxic/hyperbaric gas breathing. SCUBA diving is usually performed with a mask only covering ""half face"" (HF) and therefore forcing oral breathing. Nasal NO production is involved in vascular homeostasis and, as consequence, can significantly reduce NO possibly promoting vascular dysfunction. More recently, the utilization of ""full-face"" (FF) mask, allowing nasal breathing, became more frequent, but no reports are available describing their effects on vascular functions in comparison with HF masks. In this study we assessed and compared the effects of a standard shallow dive (20 min at 10 m) wearing either FF or a HF mask on different markers of vascular function (FMD), oxidative stress (ROS, 8-iso-PGF2α) and NO availability and metabolism (NO2, NOx and 3-NT and iNOS expression). Data from a dive breathing a hypoxic (16% O2 at depth) gas mixture with HF mask are shown allowing hyperoxic/hypoxic exposure. Our data suggest that nasal breathing might significantly reduce the occurrence of vascular dysfunction possibly due to better maintenance of NO production and bioavailability, resulting in a better ability to counter reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Besides the obvious outcomes in terms of SCUBA diving safety, our data permit a better understanding of the effects of oxygen concentrations, either in normal conditions or as a strategy to induce selected responses in health and disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35055791/,2022-11-19 11:49:10 PM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2018 Edition: A Report on 2016 Diving Fatalities, Injuries, and Incidents [Internet]","Peter Buzzacott, Petar J. Denoble, Peter Buzzacott, Petar J. Denoble",,"The 2018 DAN Annual Diving Report is a summary of recreational scuba diving and freediving incidents, injuries and fatalities that occurred in 2016 in the U.S. or Canada or that involved U.S. or Canadian residents. DAN’s intention is for this annual publication to enhance awareness of dive injuries and give divers the insights they need to better avoid emergencies.
    

      
      DAN received notification of 169 deaths involving recreational scuba diving in 2016. The largest numbers of reported fatalities occurred in Florida and California, with 20 and 7 fatalities respectively.
    

      
      The geospatial distribution of the reported fatalities by region is: 72 in North America, 27 in Europe, 23 in Oceania, 19 in the Caribbean, 18 in Asia, 4 in South America, and 1 each in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East and Central America. The location was unknown in two cases.
    

      
      Diving injury data analyzed in this report comes mainly from DAN’s Medical Services Call Center (MSCC) and its annual survey of hyperbaric chambers. Section 2, Diving Injuries, categorizes the types of injuries managed by DAN Medical Services and includes summaries of actual cases. In 2016, there were 10,320 calls or emails to the MSCC from divers who needed assistance, information or consultation; 59% of these cases were dive-related, and 41% were not. The most common dive-related health issues discussed during these calls were barotrauma, decompression sickness and marine envenomations.
    

      
      The Diving Incident Reporting System (DIRS) collects diving incident reports through the DAN website, www.DAN.org. Divers worldwide are encouraged to report any incidents that occur during dives via this system. Of the 102 incidents reported in 2016, 91 involved open-circuit scuba diving, 5 involved rebreather diving, and 6 involved breath-hold diving.
    

      
      In addition to the injury surveillance data collected by DAN in Durham, North Carolina, additional injury surveillance data analyzed in this report was contributed by DAN-affiliated agencies and other organizations around the world. Section 5 features reports from DAN Europe, DAN Japan and DAN Asia Pacific. Other organizations that reported their findings were the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), New Zealand Underwater Association, the Irish Underwater Council and the Underwater Council of British Columbia.
    

      
      Although scuba diving accidents can be fatal, many can be prevented with safe diving practices and by understanding how to identify hazards and avoid or mitigate the risks that cause accidents. The DAN Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Program enables divers and dive operators to recognize and avoid these risks; this program is described in Appendix B: DAN Operational Safety Programs.
    

      
      DAN exists to provide divers with the resources they need to make every dive accident- and injury-free. When accidents cannot be prevented, DAN is here to provide divers with emergency assistance no matter where in the world they are.
    

      
      With the support of all the DAN offices and contributors worldwide, DAN is committed to providing resources that will resonate with and be useful to divers everywhere.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021587/,2022-11-19 11:49:11 PM

"Mortality rate during professionally guided scuba diving experiences for uncertified divers, 1992-2019","Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Karl Shreeves",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to re-examine the mortality rate among participants in the Professional Association of Diving Instructors' (PADI)'s Discover Scuba Diving (DSD) programme.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fatalities reported to PADI as having occurred during DSD scuba dives were counted for each year between 1992 and 2019. DSD participant registrations were also counted for each year. The data were conveniently divided into two equal 14-year periods, 1992-2005 ('early') and 2006-2019 ('late'). To smooth out the year-to-year variation in raw rates, Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the mean rate per 100,000 participants per year during each period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were a total of 7,118,731 DSD participant registrations and 79 fatalities during the study period. The estimated overall mean mortality rate in the early period was 2.55 per 100,000 DSD registrations whereas the estimated rate of 0.87 per 100,000 DSD registrations was significantly lower in the late period (P < 0.0001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PADI's contemporary Discover Scuba Diving introductory scuba experiences, at 0.87 fatalities per 100,000 participants, have a calculated mortality rate that is less than half that calculated for 1992-2008. The late period's rate improvement appears due either to significant under-registration in the early period, or to significant safety-performance improvement in the late period or, more likely, some combination of the two.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157729/,2022-11-19 11:49:13 PM
Cardiovascular considerations for scuba divers,"Jason V Tso, Joshua M Powers, Jonathan H Kim, Jason V Tso, Joshua M Powers, Jonathan H Kim",2022 Jun 24,"As the popularity of scuba diving increases internationally, physicians interacting with divers in the clinical setting must be familiar with the cardiovascular stresses and risks inherent to this activity. Scuba presents a formidable cardiovascular challenge by combining unique environmental conditions with the physiologic demands of underwater exercise. Haemodynamic stresses encountered at depth include increased hydrostatic pressure leading to central shifts in plasma volume coupled with cold water stimuli leading to simultaneous parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic responses. Among older divers and those with underlying cardiovascular risk factors, these physiologic changes increase acute cardiac risks while diving. Additional scuba risks, as a consequence of physical gas laws, include arterial gas emboli and decompression sickness. These pathologies are particularly dangerous with altered sensorium in hostile dive conditions. When present, the appropriate management of patent foramen ovale (PFO) is uncertain, but closure of PFO may reduce the risk of paradoxical gas embolism in divers with a prior history of decompression sickness. Finally, similar to other Masters-level athletes, divers with underlying traditional cardiovascular risk should undergo complete cardiac risk stratification to determine 'fitness-to-dive'. The presence of undertreated coronary artery disease, occult cardiomyopathy, channelopathy and arrhythmias must all be investigated and appropriately treated in order to ensure diver safety. A patient-centred approach facilitating shared decision-making between divers and experienced practitioners should be utilised in the management of prospective scuba divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34670825/,2022-11-19 11:49:21 PM
"A scuba diving direct sediment sampling methodology on benthic transects in glacial lakes: procedure description, safety measures, and tests results","Alfonso Pardo, Alfonso Pardo",2014 Nov,"This work presents an in situ sediment sampling method on benthic transects, specifically intended for scientific scuba diver teams. It was originally designed and developed to sample benthic surface and subsurface sediments and subaqueous soils in glacial lakes up to a maximum depth of 25 m. Tests were conducted on the Sabocos and Baños tarns (i.e., cirque glacial lakes) in the Spanish Pyrenees. Two 100 m transects, ranging from 24.5 to 0 m of depth in Sabocos and 14 m to 0 m deep in Baños, were conducted. In each test, 10 sediment samples of 1 kg each were successfully collected and transported to the surface. This sampling method proved operative even in low visibility conditions (<2 m). Additional ice diving sampling tests were conducted in Sabocos and Truchas tarns. This sampling methodology can be easily adapted to accomplish underwater sampling campaigns in nonglacial lakes and other continental water or marine environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24943883/,2022-11-19 11:49:22 PM
Effects of Hyperbaric Nitrogen Narcosis on Cognitive Performance in Recreational air SCUBA Divers: An Auditory Event-related Brain Potentials Study,"Huseyin Karakaya, Serkan Aksu, Salih Murat Egi, Salih Aydin, Atilla Uslu, Huseyin Karakaya, Serkan Aksu, Salih Murat Egi, Salih Aydin, Atilla Uslu",2021 Jun 12,"Background:
        
      
      The narcotic effect of hyperbaric nitrogen is most pronounced in air-breathing divers because it impairs diver's cognitive and behavioral performance, and limits the depth of dive profiles. We aimed to investigate the cognitive effects of simulated (500 kPa) air environments in recreational SCUBA divers, revealed by auditory event-related potentials (AERPs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 18 healthy volunteer recreational air SCUBA divers participated in the study. AERPs were recorded in pre-dive, deep-dive, and post-dive sessions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      False-positive score variables were found with significantly higher differences and longer reaction times of hits during deep-dive and post-dive than pre-dive sessions. Also, P3 amplitudes were significantly reduced and peak latencies were prolonged during both deep-dive and post-dive compared with pre-dive sessions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We observed that nitrogen narcosis at 500 kPa pressure in the dry hyperbaric chamber has a mild-to-moderate negative effect on the cognitive performance of recreational air SCUBA divers, which threatened the safety of diving. Although relatively decreased, this effect also continued in the post-dive sessions. These negative effects are especially important for divers engaged in open-sea diving. Our results show crucial implications for the kinds of control measures that can help to prevent nitrogen narcosis and diving accidents at depths up to 40 msw.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33942846/,2022-11-19 11:49:23 PM
"Inert gas narcosis in scuba diving, different gases different reactions","Monica Rocco, P Pelaia, P Di Benedetto, G Conte, L Maggi, S Fiorelli, M Mercieri, C Balestra, R A De Blasi, ROAD Project Investigators, D Scaratozzo, F Gala, L Screpanti, Argentario Diving, S Nicolini, S Mesa, Monica Rocco, P Pelaia, P Di Benedetto, G Conte, L Maggi, S Fiorelli, M Mercieri, C Balestra, R A De Blasi, ROAD Project Investigators, D Scaratozzo, F Gala, L Screpanti, Argentario Diving, S Nicolini, S Mesa",2019 Jan,"Purpose:
        
      
      Underwater divers face several potential neurological hazards when breathing compressed gas mixtures including nitrogen narcosis which can impact diver's safety. Various human studies have clearly demonstrated brain impairment due to nitrogen narcosis in divers at 4 ATA using critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF) as a cortical performance indicator. However, recently some authors have proposed a probable adaptive phenomenon during repetitive exposure to high nitrogen pressure in rats, where they found a reversal effect on dopamine release.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty experienced divers breathing Air, Trimix or Heliox, were studied during an open water dive to a depth of 6 ATA with a square profile testing CFFF measurement before (T0), during the dive upon arriving at the bottom (6 ATA) (T1), 20 min of bottom time (T2), and at 5 m (1.5 ATA) (T3).
    


          Results:
        
      
      CFFF results showed a slight increase in alertness and arousal during the deep dive regardless of the gas mixture breathed. The percent change in CFFF values at T1 and T2 differed among the three groups being lower in the air group than in the other groups. All CFFF values returned to basal values 5 min before the final ascent at 5 m (T3), but the Trimix measurements were still slightly better than those at T0.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results highlight that nitrogen and oxygen alone and in combination can produce neuronal excitability or depression in a dose-related response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30350155/,2022-11-19 11:49:31 PM
A Doppler ultrasound self-monitoring approach for detection of relevant individual decompression stress in scuba diving,"Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt P Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch, Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt P Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch",2022 Jan,"Observing modern decompression protocols alone cannot fully prevent diving injuries especially in repetitive diving. Professional audio Doppler bubble measurements are not available to sports scuba divers. If those non-professionals were able to learn audio Doppler self-assessment for bubble grading, such skill could provide significant information on individual decisions with respect to diving safety. We taught audio Doppler self-assessment of subclavian and precordial probe position to 41 divers in a 45-min standardized, didactically optimized training. Assessment before and after air dives within sports diving limits was made through 684 audio Doppler measurements in dive-site conditions by both trained divers and a medical professional, plus additional 2D-echocardiography reference. In all dives (average maximum depth 22 m; dive time 44 min), 33% of all echocardiography measurements revealed bubbles. The specificity of audio bubble detection in combination of both detection sites was 95%, and sensitivity over all grades was 40%, increasing with higher bubble grades. Dive-site audio-Doppler-grading underestimated echo-derived bubble grades. Bubble detection sensitivity of audio Doppler self-assessments, compared to an experienced examiner, was 62% at subclavian and 73% at precordial position. 6 months after the training and 4.5 months after the last measurement, the achieved Doppler skill level remained stable. Audio Doppler self-assessment can be learned by non-professionals in a single teaching intervention. Despite accurate bubble grading is impossible in dive-site conditions, relevant high bubble grades can be detected by non-professionals. This qualitative information can be important in self-evaluating decompression stress and assessing measures for increased diving safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34241767/,2022-11-19 11:49:32 PM
Loeys-Dietz Syndrome,"Bart L Loeys, Harry C Dietz, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Bart L Loeys, Harry C Dietz, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is characterized by vascular findings (cerebral, thoracic, and abdominal arterial aneurysms and/or dissections), skeletal manifestations (pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum, scoliosis, joint laxity, arachnodactyly, talipes equinovarus, cervical spine malformation and/or instability), craniofacial features (widely spaced eyes, strabismus, bifid uvula / cleft palate, and craniosynostosis that can involve any sutures), and cutaneous findings (velvety and translucent skin, easy bruising, and dystrophic scars). Individuals with LDS are predisposed to widespread and aggressive arterial aneurysms and pregnancy-related complications including uterine rupture and death. Individuals with LDS can show a strong predisposition for allergic/inflammatory disease including asthma, eczema, and reactions to food or environmental allergens. There is also an increased incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation including eosinophilic esophagitis and gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Wide variation in the distribution and severity of clinical features can be seen in individuals with LDS, even among affected individuals within a family who have the same pathogenic variant.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of LDS is established in individuals based on characteristic clinical findings in the proband and family members and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Important considerations when managing cardiovascular features of LDS: aortic dissection can occur at smaller aortic diameters and at younger ages than observed in Marfan syndrome; vascular disease is not limited to the aortic root; angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, or other medications are used to reduce hemodynamic stress; and aneurysms are amenable to early and aggressive surgical intervention. Surgical fixation of cervical spine instability may be necessary to prevent spinal cord damage. Treatment is standard for clubfeet and severe pes planus. Management by a craniofacial team is preferred for treatment of cleft palate and craniosynostosis. Standard treatment for allergic complications with consideration of referral to an allergy/immunology specialist in severe cases. Careful and aggressive refraction and visual correction is mandatory in young children at risk for amblyopia. Hernias tend to recur after surgical intervention. A supporting mesh can be used during surgical repair to minimize recurrence risk. Optimal management of pneumothorax to prevent recurrence may require chemical or surgical pleurodesis or surgical removal of pulmonary blebs.
    

Prevention of secondary complications: Consider subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) prophylaxis in those undergoing dental work or other procedures expected to contaminate the bloodstream with bacteria. Because of high risk for cervical spine instability, a flexion/extension x-ray of the cervical spine should be performed prior to intubation or any other procedure involving manipulation of the neck.
    

Surveillance: All individuals with LDS require echocardiography at frequent intervals to monitor the status of the ascending aorta; the frequency of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) evaluation to image the entire arterial tree depends on clinical findings. Individuals with cervical spine instability and severe or progressive scoliosis should be followed by an orthopedist.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system including routine use of decongestants or triptan medications for the management of migraine headache; activities that cause joint injury or pain; for individuals at risk for recurrent pneumothorax, breathing against a resistance (e.g., playing a brass instrument) or positive pressure ventilation (e.g., SCUBA diving).
    

Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the proband is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify genetic status of at-risk family members; if the pathogenic variant is not known, relatives at risk should be evaluated for signs of LDS, including echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging if findings suggest LDS or if findings were subtle in the index case.
    

Pregnancy management: Pregnancy and the postpartum period can be dangerous for women with LDS because of increased risk of aortic dissection/rupture and uterine rupture. Increased frequency of aortic imaging is recommended, both during pregnancy and in the weeks following delivery.
    

Therapies under investigation: The safety and efficacy of angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) has not been addressed for persons with LDS in a clinical trial setting, but ARBs have proven safe and comparable or superior to beta blockers in treating other vascular connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      LDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 25% of individuals diagnosed with LDS have an affected parent; approximately 75% of probands have LDS as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with LDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and the disorder. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for LDS is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301312/,2022-11-19 11:49:33 PM
Analysis of recreational closed-circuit rebreather deaths 1998-2010,"Andrew W Fock, Andrew W Fock",2013 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Since the introduction of recreational closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) in 1998, there have been many recorded deaths. Rebreather deaths have been quoted to be as high as 1 in 100 users.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Rebreather fatalities between 1998 and 2010 were extracted from the Deeplife rebreather mortality database, and inaccuracies were corrected where known. Rebreather absolute numbers were derived from industry discussions and training agency statistics. Relative numbers and brands were extracted from the Rebreather World website database and a Dutch rebreather survey. Mortality was compared with data from other databases. A fault-tree analysis of rebreathers was compared to that of open-circuit scuba of various configurations. Finally, a risk analysis was applied to the mortality database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 181 recorded recreational rebreather deaths occurred at about 10 times the rate of deaths amongst open-circuit recreational scuba divers. No particular brand or type of rebreather was over-represented. Closed-circuit rebreathers have a 25-fold increased risk of component failure compared to a manifolded twin-cylinder open-circuit system. This risk can be offset by carrying a redundant 'bailout' system. Two-thirds of fatal dives were associated with a high-risk dive or high-risk behaviour. There are multiple points in the human-machine interface (HMI) during the use of rebreathers that can result in errors that may lead to a fatality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While rebreathers have an intrinsically higher risk of mechanical failure as a result of their complexity, this can be offset by good design incorporating redundancy and by carrying adequate 'bailout' or alternative gas sources for decompression in the event of a failure. Designs that minimize the chances of HMI errors and training that highlights this area may help to minimize fatalities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813461/,2022-11-19 11:49:34 PM
Diving Buoyancy,"Keith A. Raymond, Brian West, Jeffrey S. Cooper, Keith A. Raymond, Brian West, Jeffrey S. Cooper",,"Buoyancy while scuba diving, snorkeling, or swimming is a safety skill. It also has multiple medical and diving implications. A diver’s air consumption and fatigue are strongly correlated with their buoyancy control. Ascent and descent in a water column (whether salt or fresh) when controlled, protects the diver from barotrauma of both sinus and middle ears, pulmonary hyperinflation, air embolism, and reduces the risk of decompression sickness. Buoyancy control also affects and protects both the diver and the marine environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29261960/,2022-11-19 11:49:34 PM
Cardiovascular changes during SCUBA diving: an underwater Doppler echocardiographic study,"C Marabotti, A Scalzini, D Menicucci, M Passera, R Bedini, A L'Abbate, C Marabotti, A Scalzini, D Menicucci, M Passera, R Bedini, A L'Abbate",2013 Sep,"Aim:
        
      
      Body immersion induces blood redistribution (from peripheral to intrathoracic vessels) and is a powerful autonomic stimulus (activating both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems). For these reasons, concerns have been raised about the safety of diving for subjects with previous heart disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular changes occurring during recreational SCUBA diving, as assessed by underwater Doppler echocardiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eighteen healthy experienced divers underwent a 2D Doppler echocardiography basally, during two 15' steps of still SCUBA diving at different depths (10 m followed by 5 m) and shortly after the end of immersion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During dive, left ventricular (LV) diastolic volume and early left ventricular filling significantly increased (5 m vs. basal: P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), while both deceleration time of the early filling rate and late diastolic filling velocity significantly decreased (5 m and 10 m dive vs. basal: P < 0.01). LV volume increase and diastolic filling changes persisted at postdive evaluation, where a significant decrease in heart rate was also observed (P < 0.01 as compared to basal, 5-m and 10-m dive).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study documents that shallow-depth SCUBA diving induces LV enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. Direct underwater evaluation by Doppler echocardiography could be an appropriate tool for unmasking subjects at risk for underwater-related accidents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23638629/,2022-11-19 11:49:43 PM
Severe carbon monoxide poisonings in scuba divers: Asia-Pacific cases and causation,"John Lippmann, Ian Millar, John Lippmann, Ian Millar",2022 Third-Quarter,"Aim:
        
      
      Reports of fatal incidents in recreational scuba divers from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning are rare. This study aimed to identify scuba fatalities in the Asia-Pacific region caused by breathing-gas contamination to better understand the likely sources of contamination and reduce such preventable deaths.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A hand search of Project Stickybeak reports, subsequent Australian fatality series reports, and of published New Zealand diving fatality reports and associated data was conducted, as well as key word searches of the National Coronial Information System for scuba fatalities in Australia and New Zealand. Cases identified were matched with the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation diving fatality database. Available reports were examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four scuba deaths resulting from CO poisoning were identified from 645 scuba fatalities, including one report from each of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Maldives. A near-fatal incident was also identified in Indonesia. Two of the fatal incidents and the near-fatal incident involved internal combustion engine exhaust gases from the compressor system or elsewhere entering the air intake. Two deaths likely resulted from combustion within compressor systems.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Scuba fatalities from CO poisoning are uncommon, albeit likely under-reported. Sources of CO include exhaust gases entering the compressor and CO production by pyrolysis or gasification within the compressor or its filter system. Preventive measures include proper installation (including positioning of the air intake relative to combustion exhaust), appropriate maintenance, fitting of pressure-maintaining valves and avoidance of overheating. Formal training of compressor operators, improved diver education, mandatory requirements for installation compliance assessments, safety inspections, and the use of carbon monoxide alarms are recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36001567/,2022-11-19 11:49:44 PM
Risky business: a 15-year analysis of fatal coastal drowning of young male adults in Australia,"Jasmin C Lawes, Annabel Ellis, Shane Daw, Luke Strasiotto, Jasmin C Lawes, Annabel Ellis, Shane Daw, Luke Strasiotto",2021 Oct,"Introduction:
        
      
      Drowning is a leading cause of unintentional death, especially for males. In Australian coastal waters, young male adults account for 25% of the burden of male drowning. This study aims to describe young male coastal drowning deaths and to examine the prevalence of risk factors, especially alcohol and drugs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Characteristics of unintentional fatal drowning involving males (15-34 years) were compared with other adults (15 years and older). Data were sourced from the National Coronial Information System (Australia) and Surf Life Saving incident reports (2004/2005-2018/2019). Relative risk was calculated and χ2 tests of independence were performed (p<0.05). Blood alcohol and drug concentrations were analysed with permutational analyses of variance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Young males drowned more while jumping (9.85 times), swimming/wading (1.41 times), at rock/cliff locations (1.42 times) and on public holidays (1.8 times). Young males drowned less while boating (0.81 times), scuba diving (2.08 times), offshore (1.56 times) or due to medical factors (3.7 times). Young males drowned more (1.68 times) after consuming illicit drugs (amphetamines 2.26 times; cannabis 2.25 times) and less with prescription drugs (benzodiazepines 2.6 times; opiates 4.1 times; antidepressants 7.7 times). Blood serum concentrations of cannabis were higher in young males, while amphetamine and alcohol were lower.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Unsafe behaviours alongside certain activities or locations create deadly combinations of risk factors. A relationship between age, activity, attitude and affluence is proposed, where young males drown more in affordable activities with fewer regulations. Our results support multilevel strategies (spanning life stages) to reduce young male coastal drowning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33239312/,2022-11-19 11:49:44 PM
"Turkish recreational divers: a comparative study of their demographics, diving habits, health and attitudes towards safety","Bengusu Mirasoglu, Samil Aktas, Bengusu Mirasoglu, Samil Aktas",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      In Turkey, scuba diving has become more popular and accessible in the past decade and there has been a commensurate rise in the number of certified divers. This new generation of recreational divers has not been described in detail previously. The aim of this study was to profile this group, while investigating any gender differences and making comparisons with the global diving community.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Turkish dive club members and diving forum⁄blog readers were invited to complete an online questionnaire investigating their demography, medical issues and diving history and habits.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The questionnaire was completed by 303 female and 363 male divers. Significant differences were found between the sexes in terms of demographics, diving experience and attitudes toward safety. Previous or ongoing medical conditions were reported by 100 female divers and 141 males. Only 29% of females and 22% of males had been examined by a physician trained to conduct assessments of fitness to dive. Female divers did not report problems while diving during menstruation or while taking oral contraceptives. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of decompression sickness (DCS) and DCS-like symptoms between the sexes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the largest study to date conducted on recreational divers in Turkey and so carries some value. It profiles their physical and behavioral attributes as well as differences in diving practices between the sexes in Turkey. Our findings should have implications for medical screening and dive training standards.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868598/,2022-11-19 11:49:53 PM
A review of diving practices and outcomes following the diagnosis of a persistent (patent) foramen ovale in compressed air divers with a documented episode of decompression sickness,"Christopher W Scarff, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock, Christopher W Scarff, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      The presence of a persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO) increases the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) whilst diving with pressurised air. After the diagnosis of a PFO, divers will be offered a number of options for risk mitigation. The aim of this study was to review the management choices and modifications to diving practices following PFO diagnosis in the era preceding the 2015 joint position statement (JPS) on PFO and diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective study was conducted of divers sourced from both the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne and the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific during the period 2005-2015. Divers were contacted via a combination of phone, text, mail and email. Data collected included: diving habits (years, style and depths); DCS symptoms, signs and treatment; return to diving and modifications of dive practices; history of migraine and echocardiography (ECHO) pre- and post-intervention; ECHO technique(s) used, and success or failure of PFO closure (PFOC). Analyses were performed to compare the incidence of DCS pre- and post-PFO diagnosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-three divers were interviewed. Sixty-eight of these returned to diving following the diagnosis of PFO. Thirty-eight underwent PFOC and chose to adopt conservative diving practices (CDPs); 15 chose PFOC with no modification to practices; 15 adopted CDPs alone; and five have discontinued diving. The incidence of DCS decreased significantly following PFOC and/or adoption of conservative diving practices. Of interest, migraine with aura resolved in almost all those who underwent PFOC.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Many divers had already adopted practices consistent with the 2015 JPS permitting the resumption of scuba diving with a lowering of the incidence of DCS to that of the general diving population. These results support the recommendations of the JPS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325017/,2022-11-19 11:49:54 PM
Epilepsy and physical exercise,"José Pimentel, Raquel Tojal, Joana Morgado, José Pimentel, Raquel Tojal, Joana Morgado",2015 Feb,"Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurologic diseases and has always been associated with stigma. In the interest of safety, the activities of persons with epilepsy (PWE) are often restricted. In keeping with this, physical exercise has often been discouraged. The precise nature of a person's seizures (or whether seizures were provoked or unprovoked) may not have been considered. Although there has been a change in attitude over the last few decades, the exact role of exercise in inducing seizures or aggravating epilepsy still remains a matter of discussion among experts in the field. Based mainly on retrospective, but also on prospective, population and animal-based research, the hypothesis that physical exercise is prejudicial has been slowly replaced by the realization that physical exercise might actually be beneficial for PWE. The benefits are related to improvement of physical and mental health parameters and social integration and reduction in markers of stress, epileptiform activity and the number of seizures. Nowadays, the general consensus is that there should be no restrictions to the practice of physical exercise in people with controlled epilepsy, except for scuba diving, skydiving and other sports at heights. Whilst broader restrictions apply for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, individual risk assessments taking into account the seizure types, frequency, patterns or triggers may allow PWE to enjoy a wide range of physical activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458104/,2022-11-19 11:49:56 PM
Performance of life support breathing apparatus for under-ice diving operations,"Michael A Lang, John R Clarke, Michael A Lang, John R Clarke",2017 Jul-Aug,"Introduction:
        
      
      Single-hose scuba regulators dived in very cold water may suffer first- or second-stage malfunction, yielding complete occlusion of air flow or massive freeflow that rapidly expends a diver's air supply.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This study, conducted in Antarctica, evaluated the under-ice performance of a sampling of commercially available regulators.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventeen science divers logged a total of 305 dives in -1.86°C seawater under 6-meter-thick Antarctic fast-ice over two field seasons in 2008 and 2009. Dive profiles had an average depth of 30 msw and dive time of 29 minutes, including a mandatory three-minute safety stop at 6 msw. Sixty-nine unmodified regulator units (17 models) from 12 different manufacturers underwent standardized pre-dive regulator care and were randomly assigned to divers. Depths and times of onset of second-stage regulator freeflow were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 305 dives, there were 65 freeflows. The freeflows were not evenly distributed across the regulator brands. Regulator failure rates fell into two categories (⟨ 11% and ⟩ 26%). The regulators classified for the purpose of the test as ""acceptable"" (⟨ 11% failure rate: Dive-Rite Jetstream, Sherwood Maximus SRB3600, Poseidon Xstream Deep, Poseidon Jetstream, Sherwood Maximus SRB7600, Poseidon Cyklon, Mares USN22 Abyss) experienced only nine freeflows out of 146 exposures for a 6% overall freeflow incidence. Those classified as ""unacceptable"" (⟨ 26% failure rate) suffered 56 freeflows out of 159 exposures (35% freeflow incidence.).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Contrary to expectations, the pooled incidences for the seven best performing regulators was significantly different by Chi-square test from the 10 remaining regulators (P ⟨ 0.001).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28783885/,2022-11-19 11:49:58 PM
The impact of repetitive hyperbaric exposure during SCUBA diving on cochlear implants,"Justin M Hintze, Lina Geyer, Conall W Fitzgerald, Cristina Simoes Franklin, Fergal Glynn, Laura Viani, Peter Walshe, Justin M Hintze, Lina Geyer, Conall W Fitzgerald, Cristina Simoes Franklin, Fergal Glynn, Laura Viani, Peter Walshe",2019 Dec,"Objectives/hypothesis:
        
      
      Complications during or after cochlear implantation are relatively rare. They occur more frequently in patients who partake in activities that can potentially lead to local trauma. No formal recommendations exist for participation in self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) activities. We describe three patients with a combined five cochlear implants and extensive diving experience, the largest case series to date, and highlight some of the difficulties faced. We also review the literature on previously described SCUBA-diving patients with cochlear implants.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Retrospective case series and literature review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review of the known SCUBA divers in the National Hearing Implant and Research Centre in Ireland was conducted, and a review of the literature was carried out using PubMed and Google Scholar.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the three SCUBA divers with cochlear implants, two required reimplantation, the first due to nonauditory stimulation, and the second due to extrusion of the electrode through the tympanic membrane following repetitive SCUBA dives. The third patient remains without complications after 80 dives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with cochlear implants can have complications relating to the implant itself, with device failure a theoretical risk. The cochleostomy can lead to perilymphatic extravasation, as well as inner ear barotrauma, decompression sickness, and formation of air bubbles along the electrode. A combination of deafness, vestibulopathy with abrupt perilymph leak, and loss of proprioception can lead to disorientation and blue dome syndrome. Based on our experience with cochlear implants in SCUBA divers, along with those reported in the literature, we recommend caution in patients with cochlear implants who SCUBA dive regularly and strict adherence to the recommended safety limits.

"Epilepsy, scuba diving and risk assessment. Near misses and the need for ongoing vigilance","David Smart, John Lippmann, David Smart, John Lippmann",2013 Mar,"There is ongoing debate about the safety of scuba diving for individuals with a history of epilepsy. An in-water seizure is highly likely to be fatal. Recommendations for fitness to dive vary with some regarding epilepsy as an absolute contraindication to diving (South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society) and others permitting diving under strict criteria (United Kingdom Sport Diving Medical Committee) with diving to be postponed for a period of three to five years without seizures. Long-term follow up of people with epilepsy shows that at least one-third will have a recurrence and that the risk remains elevated for many years. We present three cases where individuals with a history of epilepsy (or likely epilepsy) almost fell through the cracks of health risk assessment, two with near-fatal consequences. These cases inform the on-going debate about fitness to dive for those with current or past epilepsy, and highlight the importance of education for doctors, dive professionals and divers about the risks associated with epilepsy and diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23508661/,2022-11-19 11:50:04 PM

          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, double-blind, open-water study, 108 advanced divers (38 females) were randomized to an air or a nitrox-group for a 60-min dive to 24 m salt water. Breathing gas effects on cognitive performance were assessed during the dive using a short- and long-term memory test and a number connection test.

Safety Priorities and Underestimations in Recreational Scuba Diving Operations: A European Study Supporting the Implementation of New Risk Management Programmes,"Serena Lucrezi, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Francois Burman, Tamer Ozyigit, Danilo Cialoni, Guy Thomas, Alessandro Marroni, Melville Saayman, Serena Lucrezi, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Francois Burman, Tamer Ozyigit, Danilo Cialoni, Guy Thomas, Alessandro Marroni, Melville Saayman",2018 Mar 23,"Introduction: Scuba diving is an important marine tourism sector, but requires proper safety standards to reduce the risks and increase accessibility to its market. To achieve safety goals, safety awareness and positive safety attitudes in recreational scuba diving operations are essential. However, there is no published research exclusively focusing on scuba divers' and dive centres' perceptions toward safety. This study assessed safety perceptions in recreational scuba diving operations, with the aim to inform and enhance safety and risk management programmes within the scuba diving tourism industry. Materials and Methods: Two structured questionnaire surveys were prepared by the organisation Divers Alert Network and administered online to scuba diving operators in Italy and scuba divers in Europe, using a mixture of convenience and snowball sampling. Questions in the survey included experience and safety offered at the dive centre; the buddy system; equipment and accessories for safe diving activities; safety issues in the certification of new scuba divers; incidents/accidents; and attitudes toward safety. Results: 91 scuba diving centres and 3,766 scuba divers participated in the study. Scuba divers gave importance to safety and the responsiveness of service providers, here represented by the dive centres. However, they underestimated the importance of a personal emergency action/assistance plan and, partly, of the buddy system alongside other safety procedures. Scuba divers agreed that some risks, such as those associated with running out of gas, deserve attention. Dive centres gave importance to aspects such as training and emergency action/assistance plans. However, they were limitedly involved in safety campaigning. Dive centres' perceptions of safety in part aligned with those of scuba divers, with some exceptions. Conclusion: Greater responsibility is required in raising awareness and educating scuba divers, through participation in prevention campaigns and training. The study supports the introduction of programmes aiming to create a culture of safety among dive centres and scuba divers. Two examples, which are described in this paper, include the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment protocol for dive centres and scuba divers, and the Diving Safety Officer programme to create awareness, improve risk management, and mitigate health and safety risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29628904/,2022-11-19 11:50:06 PM
Wearable Devices in Diving: Scoping Review,"Benjamin Bube, Bruno Baruque Zanón, Ana María Lara Palma, Heinrich Klocke, Benjamin Bube, Bruno Baruque Zanón, Ana María Lara Palma, Heinrich Klocke",2022 Sep 6,"Background:
        
      
      Wearables and their benefits for the safety and well-being of users have been widely studied and have had an enormous impact on the general development of these kinds of devices. Yet, the extent of research into the use and impact of wearable devices in the underwater environment is comparatively low. In the past 15 years, there has been an increased interest in research into wearables that are used underwater, as the use of such wearables has steadily grown over time. However, there has so far been no clear indication in the literature about the direction in which efforts for the design and construction of underwater wearable devices are developing. Therefore, the analysis presented in this scoping review establishes a good and powerful basis for the further development and orientation of current underwater wearables within the field.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this scoping review, we targeted wearable devices for underwater use to make a comprehensive map of their capabilities and features and discuss the general direction of the development of underwater wearables and the orientation of research into novel prototypes of these kinds of devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In September 2021, we conducted an extensive search for existing literature on 4 databases and for grey literature to identify developed prototypes and early-stage products that were described and tested in water, could be worn and interacted with (eg, displays, buttons, etc), and were fully functional without external equipment. The studies were written in English, came from peer-reviewed academic sources, and were published between 2005 and 2021. We reviewed each title and abstract. The data extraction process was carried out by one author and verified by another author.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 36 relevant studies were included. Among these, 4 different categories were identified; 18 studies dealt primarily with safety devices, 9 dealt with underwater communication devices, 7 dealt with head-up displays, and 2 dealt with underwater human-computer interaction approaches. Although the safety devices seemed to have gained the most interest at the time of this study, a clear trend toward underwater communication wearables was identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review sought to provide a first insight into the possibilities and challenges of the technologies that have been used in and for wearable devices that are meant for use in the underwater environment. Among these, underwater communication technologies have had the most significant influence on future developments. Moreover, a topic that has not received enough attention but should be further addressed is human-computer interaction. By developing underwater wearables that cover 2 or more of the technology categories that we identified, the extent of the benefits of such devices can be significantly increased in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36066926/,2022-11-19 11:50:11 PM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2019 Edition: A report on 2017 diving fatalities, injuries, and incidents [Internet]","Petar J. Denoble, Petar J. Denoble",,"The format of Edition 2019 is similar to that of previous editions. In Section One, we present 2017 fatality data. At the beginning of this section are summary statistics for fatalities in the U.S. and Canada followed by a series of case studies that offer further insight into causes.
    

      
      This year’s report features enhanced spatial/geographic data. Section Two includes a series of maps of fatal and nonfatal dive-related injuries around the U.S. and the world. For the first time, we have county-level data in Florida and California, the states with the most diving. These popular dive destinations accommodate various scuba diving activities, including wreck diving and underwater harvesting. We are pleased to have reached this level of geospatial analysis and will continue to work with public health officials in these counties for the next 10 years.
    

      
      In Section Three we present the summary statistics of nonfatal injuries, based on data from the DAN Medical Services Call Center, as well as an in-depth review of select cases. Section Four focuses on incident reports, most of which did not involve any injury, provided voluntarily by divers. The breath-hold diving portion of the report follows in Section Five. DAN employs various injury and fatality prevention strategies, so we added a section, Section Six, about training programs, which target individual divers, and hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) programs, which promote operational safety.
    

      
      The addition of enhanced geographic data is a step forward for the report, but there is always more to do. Among the improvements we are considering for the coming years are interactive digital maps of injuries and fatalities, a revamping of the dive incident reporting system, an enhanced coding system for increased granularity, inclusion of diving-adjacent activities (such as topside accidents involving scuba cylinders) and greater coordination with training agencies and other organizations to standardize reporting and capture even more incidents.
    

      
      Our data revealed some interesting themes. For one, cardiovascular disease was present in many of the available autopsy reports. We also noted that fatalities occurred in people of various certification levels and participation frequency and that a significant number of deaths occur at shallow depths. Analysis by DAN experts revealed that a better understanding of cardiovascular disease and the buddy system’s role in dive fatalities is crucial.
    

      
      Dive fatalities are complex and poorly understood. If similar medical conditions and circumstances were to appear in a person outside of the water, death might be attributed to a chronic disease. Because symptoms presented in the water, however, the fatality is often attributed to diving. It is this complexity that makes it so challenging for scientists to decipher the risk factors and spurious associations in fatal and nonfatal dive accidents.
    

      
      It is not surprising that nonfatal scuba injuries occur with greater frequency than fatalities. The challenge in analyzing the trends and distribution of scuba injuries is identifying who is diving and how frequently.
    

      
      The analysis of the data on fatal and nonfatal breath-hold diving injuries yielded several insights. Notably, men were more often involved in breath-hold incidents than women, and people in their twenties and thirties were more often involved than people in other age groups. Divers over forty years of age, however, were more often involved in breath-hold fatalities. Breath-hold diving activities range from what could be described as child’s play to competitive freediving involving highly trained divers that push the limits of the human body. No matter the dive depth, it is vital that breath-hold divers understand the body’s reaction to diving. While chronic disease may have played a role in some of the analyzed cases, there is also reason to believe that some deaths were due to miscalculations of the individuals’ ability to hold their breath long enough to return to the surface.
    

      
      To prevent injury and loss of life, change must happen at various levels. We continue to expand our outreach to divers and dive professionals through training and risk management programs. DAN’s first aid and HIRA programs are the most relevant, detailed, and comprehensive such programs in the industry.
    

      
      This report has pages of detailed case analysis. Some of you will read through each in detail, while others will give them a passing glance. Perhaps the most important message to take away is that divers must continue to help divers stay safe.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32991099/,2022-11-19 11:50:12 PM
"Scuba diving-related fatalities in New Zealand, 2007 to 2016","John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Michael Davis, John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Michael Davis",2021 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      New Zealand (NZ) diving-related fatalities have been reported since the 1960s. The aim is to identify contributing risk factors, including medical, and to inform appropriate preventative strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      NZ scuba diving fatalities from 2007 to 2016 were searched from multiple sources - the National Coronial Information System (NCIS); the NZ Chief Coroner's office; Water Safety NZ Drownbase™ and the NZ Police National Dive Squad records. For inclusion, a victim must have been wearing a scuba set (which may include a rebreather). A key word search of the NCIS was made and the results matched to the other databases. An Excel® database was created and a chain of events analysis (CEA) conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-eight scuba diving fatalities were identified, 40 men and eight women, average age 47 years (range 17-68), 20 of Māori ethnicity. Thirty-five were classified as overweight (14) or obese (21). Pre-existing medical risk factors were identified, either pre dive or at autopsy, in 37 divers, the commonest being ischaemic heart disease (IHD, 20), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, 18) and hypertension (seven). IHD, LVH and obesity were variously associated with each other. The likely commonest disabling conditions, identified in 32 cases, were asphyxia (15), cardiac (nine) and pulmonary barotrauma/cerebral arterial gas embolism (five). Multiple environmental and diving practice breaches and poor planning were identified in the CEA, similar to those seen in other studies. Thirty-eight divers had not released their weight belt. Information on resuscitation was limited.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Obesity and cardiovascular disease were common and Māori appear to be over-represented, both as previously reported.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897599/,2022-11-19 11:50:13 PM
Clustering of recreational divers by their health conditions in a database of a citizen science project,"Tamer Ozyigit, Cuneyt Yavuz, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni, Tamer Ozyigit, Cuneyt Yavuz, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni",2019,"Divers Alert Network Europe has created a database with a large amount of dive-related data that has been collected since 1993 within the scope of the Diving Safety Laboratory citizen science project. The main objectives of this study are the grouping divers by their health information and revealing significant differences in diving parameters using data mining techniques. Due to the methodology of the project, data cleaning was performed before applying clustering methods in order to eliminate potential mistakes resulting from inaccuracies and missing information. Despite the fact that 63% of the data were lost during the cleaning phase, the remaining 1,169 ""clean"" diver data enabled meaningful clustering using the ""two-step"" method. Experienced male divers without any health problems are in Cluster 1. Male and female divers with health problems and high rates of cigarette smoking are in Cluster 2; healthy, overweight divers are in Cluster 3. There are significant differences in terms of dive parameters including pre- and post-dive conditions with respect to each group, such as: exercise level, alcohol consumption, thermal comfort, equipment malfunctions, and maximum depth. The study proves the usefulness of citizen science projects, while data collection methodologies can be improved to decrease potential mistakes resulting from inconsistencies, inaccuracies and missing information. It is hypothesized that if naturally occurring clusters of divers were identified it might be possible to identify risk factors arising from different clusters while merging the database with other dive accident databases in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051062/,2022-11-19 11:50:14 PM
"Scuba diving fatalities in Australia, 2001 to 2013: Diver demographics and characteristics","John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study identified characteristics of victims of fatal scuba diving incidents to determine contributing factors and inform appropriate countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was searched to identify scuba diving deaths for 2001-2013, inclusive. Data were extracted from witness and police reports, medical histories and autopsies. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse these data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 scuba diving-related fatalities identified during the study period. The mean age was 44 years, 99 (79%) victims were male and 83 (77%) were either overweight or obese. Most deaths occurred in New South Wales and Queensland, often in a commercial setting. Twenty-three (79%) Queensland victims were overseas tourists. At least 52 (41%) were novices and 17 (13%) died during training or an introductory scuba experience. Only 35 (28%) were with a buddy when the incident occurred and at least 81 (64%) were still wearing weights when recovered.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The age of these victims may reflect an older cohort of participants and the associated higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions. The high prevalence of obesity suggests that this may be a risk factor. The high proportion of deaths in overseas tourists highlights an on-going need for appropriate screening and monitoring in what may be a higher risk cohort. The number of deaths that occurred under instruction highlights the importance of careful assessment of the site, prevailing conditions, an appropriate instructor-student ratio and close supervision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557411/,2022-11-19 11:50:14 PM
Barodontalgia Among Aircrew and Divers,"Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik, Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik",2019 Feb 1,"BACKGROUND: Barodontalgia, barometric pressure-induced dental pain, may jeopardize diving/flight safety. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the rate of barodontalgia among military and civilian divers and aircrews based on previous reports.METHODS: We analyzed the data of 4894 aircrew/divers reported in the literature. Barodontalgia rates (flight vs. diving, military vs. civilian, pressurized vs. non-pressurized aircrafts) were analyzed. The Chi-squared test was used to compare between groups.RESULTS: Of the 4894 individuals, 402 (8.2%) suffered from barodontalgia. Divers (9.8%) were more vulnerable than aircrews (5.8%). Barodontalgia experience rate was 5.4% and 6.5% in military and civilian aircrews, respectively, and 7.3% and 12.8% in military and civilian scuba divers, respectively. Barodontalgia was more common among aircrews of pressurized than non-pressurized aircrafts (7.3% vs. 3.2%, respectively).DISCUSSION: The greater amplitude of barometric pressure changes explains the higher rate of barodontalgia in divers than aircrew. The higher rate during pressurized flights is possibly because intracabin pressure in the pressurized cabin is still routinely higher than in nonpressurized aircrafts. Improved oral care and mandatory annual dental checkups may be the reason for the significantly lower rate of barodontalgia experienced among military aircrews and divers compared to their civilian counterparts. These results emphasize the essential role of atmospheric pressure change in the generation of pain during flight or diving and the importance of proper dental care.Nakdimon I, Zadik Y.

An Updated Narrative Review on Ergometric Systems Applied to Date in Assessing Divers' Fitness,"Sven Dreyer, Johannes Schneppendahl, Fabian Moeller, Andreas Koch, Thomas Muth, Jochen D Schipke, Sven Dreyer, Johannes Schneppendahl, Fabian Moeller, Andreas Koch, Thomas Muth, Jochen D Schipke",2021 Aug 13,"Many recreational divers suffer medical conditions, potentially jeopardizing their safety. To scale down risks, medical examinations are mandatory and overwhelmingly performed using bicycle ergometry, which overlooks some important aspects of diving. Searching ergometric systems that better address the underwater environment, a systematic literature search was conducted using the keywords 'diving', 'fitness', 'ergometry', and 'exertion'. All presented alternative systems found convincingly describe a greatly reduced underwater physical performance. Thus, if a diver's workload in air should already be limited, he/she will suffer early from fatigue, risking a diving incident. How to assess fitness? Performance diagnostics in sports is always specific for a modality or movement. Therefore, professional scuba divers should be tested when fin-swimming underwater. For the vast number of recreational divers, the current screening can likely not be replaced. However, to prevent accidents, divers need to understand and be able to improve factors that limit their physical performance underwater.

Decompression illness and other injuries in a recreational dive charter operation,"Marion Hubbard, F Michael Davis, Kate Malcolm, Scott J Mitchell, Marion Hubbard, F Michael Davis, Kate Malcolm, Scott J Mitchell",2018 Dec 24,"Introduction:
        
      
      Health and safety within the recreational diving industry are poorly described. We aimed to obtain the true prevalence of decompression illness (DCI) and other diving and non-diving injuries, including occupational injuries, in a large recreational diving charter operation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A New Zealand recreational diving operator keeps detailed records of diving activity and event/incident reports. We extracted passenger and crew numbers, dive numbers and incident statistics from all boat trips and associated work-related injuries between 01 January 2008 and 31 December 2014. The records of divers referred to the regional hyperbaric unit for suspected DCI were reviewed retrospectively. Using these data the prevalence of DCI and non-diving injuries were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 65,536 person-trips to sea and 57,072 divers undertook 97,144 dives. Fifty-five injury events were documented over seven years, 31 in customers and 24 in staff. Four divers (including one staff member) diagnosed with DCI underwent recompression therapy, giving a prevalence of 0.41 cases requiring recompression per 10,000 dives, or one case per 24,386 dives, whilst five other divers were assessed as not having DCI. There was one cardiac-related fatality. Thirty-five non-diving injuries (mainly lacerations and minor musculoskeletal injuries) were documented in 30 people resulting in 10 consulting a general practitioner and seven presenting to the local regional hospital emergency department.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      DCI requiring recompression was relatively rare in this supervised recreational diving operation. Minor non-diving injuries were the most common adverse event. Compared to other adventure sports, the prevalence of injury in recreational scuba diving is low.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517953/,2022-11-19 11:50:17 PM
Self-reported exercise behaviour and perception of its importance to recreational divers,"Christopher R Kovacs, Peter Buzzacott, Christopher R Kovacs, Peter Buzzacott",2017,"Background:
        
      
      This study examined self-reported physical activity and perceptions of exercise importance among certified divers in two distinct age groups.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Questionnaires were distributed by hand at dive sites in three states of the United States, half to students from an academic programme in scuba diving at a regional university. The survey included questions about health status, dive history, certification levels, structured exercise activity levels and perceived importance of regular exercise to their health, diving ability, and safety. Also included was the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, a validated physical activity classification instrument for use among adults.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Non-students were older than the students and had greater diving experience. There was no detectable difference between groups in perceived exercise importance to health (p = 0.69), diving ability (p = 0.75), or diving safety (p = 0.25). Fitting age, sex, occupation and number of dives to a generalised linear model to predict Godin-Shephard scores, number of dives was removed first (p = 0.43), followed by student status (p = 0.33). Remaining predictors of Godin-Shephard exercise scores were age (-0.004 per year, p < 0.0001) and sex (males = + 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.17, p = 0.0012). Both groups reported similar structured exercise regularity, overall health and perceived importance of regular exercise for health, diving and safety.

Diving after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection: Fitness to dive assessment and medical guidance,"Charlotte Sadler, Miguel Alvarez Villela, Karen Van Hoesen, Ian Grover, Michael Lang, Tom Neuman, Peter Lindholm, Charlotte Sadler, Miguel Alvarez Villela, Karen Van Hoesen, Ian Grover, Michael Lang, Tom Neuman, Peter Lindholm",2020 Sep 30,"Scuba diving is a critical activity for commercial industry, military activities, research, and public safety, as well as a passion for many recreational divers. Physicians are expected to provide return-to-diving recommendations after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection based upon the best available evidence, often drawn from experience with other, similar diseases. Scuba diving presents unique physiologic challenges to the body secondary to immersion, increased pressure and increased work of breathing. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are still unknown, but if they are proven to be similar to other coronaviruses (such as Middle East respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV-1) they may result in long-term pulmonary and cardiac sequelae that impact divers' ability to safely return to scuba diving. This review considers available literature and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as it relates to diving fitness, including current recommendations for similar illnesses, and proposes guidelines for evaluation of divers after COVID-19. The guidelines are based upon best available evidence about COVID-19, as well as past experience with determination of diving fitness.

Executive Functions of Divers Are Selectively Impaired at 20-Meter Water Depth,"Fabian Steinberg, Michael Doppelmayr, Fabian Steinberg, Michael Doppelmayr",2017 Jun 20,"Moving and acting underwater within recreational or occupational activities require intact executive functions, since they subserve higher cognitive functions such as successful self-regulation, coping with novel situations, and decision making; all of which could be influenced by nitrogen narcosis due to elevated partial pressure under water. However, specific executive functions that could provide a differentiated view on humans' cognitive performance ability have not yet been systematically analyzed in full-water immersion, which is a research gap addressed within this approach to contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen narcosis. In this study, 20 young, healthy, and certified recreational divers participated and performed three different executive-function tests: the Stroop test (Inhibition), the Number/Letter test (Task switching), the 2-back test (Updating/Working memory), and a simple reaction time test (Psychomotor performance). These tests were performed once on land, at 5-meter (m) water depth, and at 20-meter (m) water depth of an indoor diving facility in standardized test conditions (26°C in all water depths). A water-proofed and fully operational tablet computer was used to present visual stimuli and to register reaction times. Performance of the simple reaction time test was not different between underwater and land testing, suggesting that reaction times were not biased by the utilization of the tablet in water immersion. Executive functions were not affected by the shallow water immersion of 5-m water depth. However, performance scores in 20-m water depth revealed a decreased performance in the incongruent test condition (i.e., an index of inhibitory control ability) of the Stroop test, while all other tests were unaffected. Even though only one out of the three tested cognitive domains was affected, the impairment of inhibitory control ability even in relatively shallow water of 20-m is a critical component that should be considered for diver's safety, since inhibition is required in self-control requiring situations where impulsive and automatic behavior must be inhibited. Our interpretation of these selective impairments is based on a discussion suggesting that different neural networks within the central nervous system, which process specific executive functions, are affected differently by nitrogen narcosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28676772/,2022-11-19 11:50:19 PM
Estimating Inert Gas Bubbling from Simple SCUBA Diving Parameters,"Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch, Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch",2021 Jul,"Inert gas bubbles frequently occur in SCUBA divers' vascular systems, eventually leading to decompression accidents. Only in professional settings, dive profiles can be adjusted on individual basis depending on bubble grades detected through ultrasonography. A total of 342 open-circuit air dives following sports diving profiles were assessed using echocardiography. Subsequently, (Eftedal-Brubakk) bubble grades were correlated with dive and individual parameters. Post-dive cardiac bubbles were observed in 47% of all dives and bubble grades were significantly correlated with depth (r=0.46), air consumption (r=0.41), age (r=0.25), dive time (r=0.23), decompression diving (r=0.19), surface time (r=- 0.12). Eftedal-Brubakk categorical bubble grades for sports diving with compressed air can be approximated by bubble grade = (age*50-1 - surface time*150-1+maximum depth*45-1+air consumption*4500-1)2 (units in years, hours, meter, and bar*liter; R2=0.31). Thus, simple dive and individual parameters allow reasonable estimation of especially relevant medium to higher bubble grades for information on relevant decompression stress after ascent. Echo bubble grade 0 is overestimated by the formula derived. However, echo might fail to detect minor bubbling only. The categorical prediction of individual decompression stress with simple bio and dive data should be evaluated further to be developed towards dive computer included automatic ex-post information for decision-making on individual safety measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33506443/,2022-11-19 11:50:20 PM
Dive Medicine: Current Perspectives and Future Directions,"Wayne Anderson, Patrick Murray, Kristin Hertweck, Wayne Anderson, Patrick Murray, Kristin Hertweck",2019 Apr,"As SCUBA diving continues to rapidly grow in the United States and worldwide, physicians should have a fundamental working knowledge to provide care for an injured diver. SCUBA divers are faced with many hazards at depths that are normally well compensated for at sea level. Pressure gradients, changes in the partial pressure of inhaled gases and gas solubility can have disastrous effects to the diver if not managed properly. Many safety measures in SCUBA diving are governed by the laws of physics, but some have come under scrutiny. This has prompted increased research concerning in water recompression and flying after diving. This article will give physicians an understanding of the dangers divers encounter and the current treatment recommendations.

Stability of residual hearing and cochlear implant function following multiple scuba dives: case report,"Daniel M Zeitler, Galit Almosnino, James R Holm, Daniel M Zeitler, Galit Almosnino, James R Holm",2018 May-Jun,"Objectives:
        
      
      There are limited data regarding the safety of cochlear implants during exposure to pressure changes associated with scuba and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. There are no data regarding the effects of barometric pressure changes on preserved low-frequency hearing after cochlear implantation. This case report evaluates the effect of barometric pressure changes on preserved low-frequency hearing after cochlear implantation.
    


          Patient:
        
      
      This is a case report of a patient who underwent successful cochlear implantation with postoperative preservation of residual low-frequency hearing.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      20 scuba dives up to depths of 92 feet (3.8 atmospheres absolute).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Audiometric testing both before and after scuba shows no change in hearing thresholds. The internal receiver-stimulator of the cochlear implant was unaffected by prolonged and repeated pressures up to approximately 3.8 atmospheres absolute. The patient had no adverse middle ear effects during or after the dives, and no evidence of inner ear barotrauma or decompression sickness as a result of the elevated pressures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first report of preserved hearing after cochlear implantation being maintained following scuba diving, and corroborates previous literature showing that exposure to increased pressures with a cochlear implant in situ is safe without adverse effects on the implant hardware or software. Scuba diving appears safe not only with cochlear implants but also in patients with residual hearing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30028923/,2022-11-19 11:50:22 PM
The epidemiology of injury in scuba diving,"Peter L Buzzacott, Peter L Buzzacott",2012,"The epidemiology of injury associated with recreational scuba diving is reviewed. A search of electronic databases and reference lists identified pertinent research. Barotrauma, decompression sickness and drowning-related injuries were the most common morbidities associated with recreational scuba diving. The prevalence of incidents ranged from 7 to 35 injuries per 10,000 divers and from 5 to 152 injuries per 100,000 dives. Recreational scuba diving fatalities account for 0.013% of all-cause mortality aged ≥ 15 years. Drowning was the most common cause of death. Among treated injuries, recovery was complete in the majority of cases. Dive injuries were associated with diver-specific factors such as insufficient training and preexisting medical conditions. Environmental factors included air temperature and flying after diving. Dive-specific factors included loss of buoyancy control, rapid ascent and repetitive deep diving. The most common event to precede drowning was running out of gas (compressed air). Though diving injuries are relatively rare prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to quantify the effects of known risk factors and, indeed, asymptomatic injuries (e.g. brain lesions). Dive injury health economics data also remains wanting. Meanwhile, health promotion initiatives should continue to reinforce adherence to established safe diving practices such as observing depth/time limits, safety stops and conservative ascent rates. However, there is an obvious lack of evaluated diving safety interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22824839/,2022-11-19 11:50:22 PM
The relationship of decongestant use and risk of decompression sickness; a case-control study of Hawaiian scuba divers,"Richard W Smerz, Richard W Smerz",2014 Feb,"Exposure to cold, dehydration, and aging are known to contribute to the development of decompression sickness (DCS) in divers. Hypertension and nicotine usage have also been suggested as risk factors. Vasoconstriction is an underlying mechanism associated with all of these risk factors. Vasoconstriction increases the degree of bubble formation which is believed to be the cause of DCS. Formed bubbles interfere with the production of nitric oxide which modulates vascular tone resulting in vasoconstriction. Divers commonly use sympathomimetic decongestants which induce vasoconstriction to prevent barotrauma of the ears and sinuses while diving and thus theoretically may contribute to the risk for developing DCS. The purpose of this case-control study was to explore the association between decongestant usage and development of DCS in 400 divers treated/evaluated at the University of Hawai'i, John A. Burns School of Medicine between 1983 and 2010. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were employed to evaluate differences between cases and controls. In addition to the variable of interest, other co-variables known to have significant influence in the development of DCS were appropriately controlled for during the analyses. In this study population, dehydration (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.4), repetitive diving (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.8, 4.4), and violation of dive profiles (OR = 4.9; 95% CI: 3.1, 7.9) contributed independently and significantly to the development of DCS. The co-variables of cold, gender, obesity, and rapid ascents were not significant contributors to developing DCS in this study. There was a small but statistically insignificant risk associated with decongestant use (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.8-2.6; P = .22). The inherent limitations associated with records-based studies may have underestimated this risk. It is important therefore that future research be undertaken to help clarify this concern.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24567870/,2022-11-19 11:50:23 PM
Is it safe to SCUBA dive with asthma?,"Megan Dp Gore, Giles Dixon, Andrew E Stanton, Megan Dp Gore, Giles Dixon, Andrew E Stanton",2019 Nov,"Introduction: Internationally it is estimated that six million people participate in self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving each year. Registries suggest a significant proportion of divers have a current or historical diagnosis of asthma. Previously individuals with asthma were prohibited from diving, however, several contemporary guidelines suggest a select population of patients with asthma may be able to dive with an acceptable degree of risk. Areas covered: Divers with asthma may be at an increased risk of a variety of diving-related medical injuries including; pulmonary barotrauma (PBT), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, arterial gas embolism (AGE), reduction in pulmonary function, bronchospasm and decompression sickness (DCS). This article will discuss the latest evidence on the incidence of adverse events in diving with a focus on those caused by asthma.

Development and Validation of a Virtual Environment to Evaluate the Capacity in Executing the Safety Procedures in Recreational Scuba Diving,"Luiz Teruo Kawamoto Jr, Annie France Frère Slaets, Silvia Cristina Martini Rodrigues, Luiz Teruo Kawamoto Jr, Annie France Frère Slaets, Silvia Cristina Martini Rodrigues",2012 Apr,"Background:
        
      
      Recreational scuba diving courses have safety procedures in their curriculum to be followed in case of emergencies. However, the actual diving is often performed months after the training. Because these procedures are counterinstinctive, when emergencies occur the divers in panic cannot follow them.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Thus a virtual environment was developed, presenting several emergency situations that may occur during a recreational dive. It used an Intel(®) (Santa Clara, CA) Core™2 Duo (1.66 GHz, 1 GB RAM) PC and Adobe (San Jose, CA) Fireworks and Adobe Flash 8 for animation and programming. The procedures to be followed were the standards of the Association of Dive Schools.

Physical Exercise Intensity During Submersion Selectively Affects Executive Functions,"Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Marc Dalecki, Tobias Dräger, Michael Doppelmayr, Fabian Steinberg, Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Marc Dalecki, Tobias Dräger, Michael Doppelmayr, Fabian Steinberg",2021 Mar,"Objective:
        
      
      The intact cognitive processing capacity in highly demanding and dynamically changing situations (e.g., in extreme environmental conditions) is of central relevance for personal safety. This study therefore investigated whether underwater physical exercise (PE) affected cognitive performance by comparing these effects during underwater fin-swimming as opposed to inactivity under normal environmental conditions.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Although acute bouts of PE can modulate cognitive performance under highly controlled and standardized laboratory conditions, no previous study has determined whether PE acutely modulates cognitive performance in non-laboratory testing conditions involving extreme environments (e.g., underwater).
    


          Method:
        
      
      A total of 27 healthy volunteers (16 males and 11 females; 28.9 ± 7.4 years of age) participated in two experiments involving either moderate or high PE intensity. A PRE/POST crossover design was employed among participants while performing cognitive tests in a counterbalanced order (i.e., before and after 20 min of PE in submersion [WET] and once before and after inactivity [DRY] while in the laboratory). Cognitive performance was measured as a combination of executive functions through the Eriksen Flanker (inhibition) and Two-Back (working memory) Tasks using an underwater tablet computer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ANOVAs revealed enhanced reaction times only in the Flanker test after moderate PE for the WET condition. No other effects were detected.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These findings indicate that cognitive performance is exercise-intensity-dependent with enhanced effects during moderate PE, even in extreme environments (i.e., underwater).
    


          Application:
        
      
      These results should be relevant in recreational and occupational contexts involving underwater activity and may also apply to microgravity (e.g., during extra-vehicular activities).
    


          Description:
        
      
      This study compared the acute effects of physical exercise (PE) on cognitive performance in an underwater environment while participants fin-swam with SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) gear. Findings revealed that 20 min of moderate PE positively affected cognitive performance (i.e., inhibitory control ability). However, no changes were observed after high-intensity exercise.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31596615/,2022-11-19 11:50:25 PM

Oxygen exposures at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab: a 20-year experience,"Shane C Walker, Alejandro Garbino, Kristi Ray, Renny Hardwick, Daniel T Fitzpatrick, Robert W Sanders, Shane C Walker, Alejandro Garbino, Kristi Ray, Renny Hardwick, Daniel T Fitzpatrick, Robert W Sanders",2018 Jul-Aug,"Astronauts training for extravehicular activity (EVA) operations can spend many hours submerged underwater in a pressurized suit, called an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU), exposed to pressures exceeding 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA). To minimize the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) a 46% nitrox mixture is used. This limits the nitrogen partial pressure, decreasing the risk of DCS. The trade-off with using a 46% nitrox mixture is the increased potential for oxygen toxicity, which can lead to severe neurologic symptoms including seizures. Suited runs, which typically expose astronauts of 0.9-1.1 ATA for longer than six hours, routinely exceed the recommendation for central nervous system oxygen toxicity limits (CNSOTL) published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Fortunately, in over 50,000 hours of suited training dives spanning 20 years of EVA training operations at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) there has never been an occurrence of oxygen toxicity. This lends support to anecdotal sentiment among certain members of the hyperbaric community that the NOAA CNSOTL recommendations might be overly conservative, at least for the oxygen pressure and time regime in which NBL operates. The NOAA CNSOTL recommendations are the result of expert consensus with a focus on safety and do not necessarily reflect rigorous experimental evidence. The data from the NBL suited dive operations provide a foundation of evidence that can help inform the expert discussion on dive-related neurologic oxygen toxicity performance and overnight recovery in young, healthy males.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30241122/,2022-11-19 11:50:26 PM
"Medical conditions in scuba diving fatality victims in Australia, 2001 to 2013","John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study identified pre-existing medical conditions among scuba diving fatalities in Australia from 2001 to 2013, inclusive, and assessed whether these conditions likely contributed to the deaths.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was searched for scuba diving-related cases during 2001-2013, inclusive. Coronial findings, witness and police reports, medical histories, and autopsy and toxicology reports were scrutinised for pre-existing medical conditions and autopsy findings. Predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and causes of death were analysed using a validated template.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 scuba diving-related fatalities identified during the study period. Forty-six (37%) divers were identified as having a significant medical condition which may have contributed to their incident. The most common condition was ischaemic heart disease (IHD) which had been diagnosed in 15 of the divers. Thirty-two (25%) deaths were attributed to cardiac disabling injuries (DI) such as ischaemic heart disease and arrhythmias, although a cardiac DI was thought likely in another six. Respiratory conditions were implicated in eight (6%) deaths, at least four associated with cerebral arterial gas embolism. At least 14 (11%) divers who had contributory pre-existing medical conditions had been cleared to dive by a medical practitioner within the year prior.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Chronic health-related factors played a major role in almost half of these deaths; primarily cardiac conditions such as IHD and cardiac arrhythmias. Although fitness-to-dive (FTD) assessments have limitations, the high incidence of cardiac-related deaths indicates a need for 'older' divers to be medically assessed for FTD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557410/,2022-11-19 11:50:27 PM
Altered Venous Blood Nitric Oxide Levels at Depth and Related Bubble Formation During Scuba Diving,"Danilo Cialoni, Andrea Brizzolari, Michele Samaja, Massimo Pieri, Alessandro Marroni, Danilo Cialoni, Andrea Brizzolari, Michele Samaja, Massimo Pieri, Alessandro Marroni",2019 Feb 21,"Introduction: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of diving, and the related endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress roles have been extensively investigated. However, most available data have been obtained before and after the dive, whilst, as far as we know, no data is available about what happens during the water immersion phase of dive. The scope of this study is to investigate the Nitrate and Nitrite (NOX) concentration and the total plasma antioxidant capacity (TAC) before, during and after a single SCUBA dive in healthy scuba diving volunteers, as well as to look for evidence of a possible relationship with venous gas bubble formation. Materials and Methods: Plasma, obtained from blood of 15 expert SCUBA divers, 13 male and 2 female, was investigated for differences in NOX and TAC values in different dive times. Differences in NOX and TAC values in subjects previously known as ""bubble resistant"" (non-bubblers - NB) and ""bubble prone"" (Bubblers - B) were investigated. Results: We found a statistically significant increase of NOX plasma concentration in the ""bottom blood draw"" and in the ""safety stop blood draw"" as compared to the basal pre diving condition. We did not find any difference in NOX plasma concentration between the basal value and the post diving samples. We did not find any significant statistical difference in TAC in the bottom blood sample, while the safety-stop and the post-dive samples showed higher TAC values compared with the basal value. We did not find any difference in NOX and TAC mean values between non-bubblers and Bubblers. Discussion: Our protocol, by including underwater blood drawing, allowed to monitor plasma NOX changes occurred during diving activity, and not only by comparing pre and post diving values. It is particularly interesting to note that the increased NOX values found at the bottom and at the safety stop were not observed at post dive sampling (T0, T30, T60), showing a very rapid return to the pre-dive values. In this preliminary study we did not find any relationship between bubble formation and changes in NOX parameters and TAC response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30846941/,2022-11-19 11:50:28 PM
The demographics and diving behaviour of DAN Asia-Pacific members with and without pre-existing medical conditions,"John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Simon Mitchell, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Simon Mitchell",2016 Dec,"Introduction:
        
      
      This report examines Diver Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) members with and without cardiac or respiratory conditions, diabetes or hypertension and compares their demographics, health and diving activities.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      Two online cross-sectional surveys of DAN AP members were conducted. The first sought information from 833 divers who applied for membership between July 2009 and August 2013 and who had declared the targeted medical conditions. The second, conducted between December 2014 and April 2015, was sent to 9,927 current members with known email addresses. The groups were compared for age, gender, body mass index, fitness, smoking and diving qualifications, history, currency and practices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 343 (41%) respondents to the first survey, 267 (32%) provided sufficient information for inclusion. Of 1,786 (18%) respondents to the second survey, 1,437 (15%) had no targeted medical condition and were included in the analysis. Those with medical conditions were on average 4.7 years older (P 〈 0.001); more overweight or obese (68% versus 57%, P = 0.001); took more medications (57% vs. 29%, P 〈 0.001), smoked less (4% vs. 7%, P = 0.02) and did less repetitive diving (median 75 vs 90, P 〈 0.001). Other diving demographics were similar.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A substantial number of people are diving with medical conditions and there is a need to better understand the associated risks.

Immersion pulmonary edema: an analysis of 31 cases from Oceania,"Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Alfred Bove, Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Alfred Bove",2019,"Aim:
        
      
      To review incidents of immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) from Oceania, to determine the demographics, diving parameters, and comorbidities that may be related to this disorder.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Incidents of IPE, most of which were documented by Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) or reported in our medical literature, were analyzed. They included interviews with the survivors and a review of available medical records. Only incidents diagnosed as IPE by specialist diving physicians or pathologists with experience in the investigation of diving accidents were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one IPE incidents in divers from Oceania were documented. There were two surface snorkelers, 22 scuba air divers and seven nitrox divers, which included three closed-circuit rebreathers (CCR). The mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years, 58% of victims were females, and the average dive profile was to a maximum depth of 19 msw for 25 minutes. Six victims (19%) had previous episodes of IPE. There were nine recorded fatalities in this cohort. Medical comorbidities were recorded in 68%, with 42% being cardiac. The latter included valvular disease in 29%, transient cardiomyopathies in 26% and dysrhythmias in 16%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      IPE was more likely in middle-aged females, in experienced divers, and during ascent or after surfacing. Commonly reported associations such as exertion, stress, cold exposure, negative inspiratory pressure, hypertension, overhydration, tight wetsuit, aspiration and certain medications were identified. This series supports the hypothesis that the elderly IPE subjects are likely to have comorbidities and be susceptible to IPE recurrences and fatalities unless the contributing factors can be identified and addressed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683357/,2022-11-19 11:50:30 PM

Although tourism is an important economic vehicle for the host country, its continued growth has led to on-going concerns about its environmental sustainability. Coastal and marine tourism can directly affect the environment through direct and indirect tourist activities. For these reasons tourism sector needs practical actions of sustainability. Several studies have shown how education minimizes the impact on and is proactive for, preserving the natural resources. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a citizen science program to improve the environmental education of the volunteers, by means of questionnaires provided to participants to a volunteer-based Red Sea coral reef monitoring program (STEproject). Fifteen multiple-choice questions evaluated the level of knowledge on the basic coral reef biology and ecology and the awareness on the impact of human behaviour on the environment. Volunteers filled in questionnaires twice, once at the beginning, before being involved in the project and again at the end of their stay, after several days participation in the program. We found that the participation in STEproject significantly increased both the knowledge of coral reef biology and ecology and the awareness of human behavioural impacts on the environment, but was more effective on the former. We also detected that tourists with a higher education level have a higher initial level of environmental education than less educated people and that the project was more effective on divers than snorkelers. This study has emphasized that citizen science projects have an important and effective educational value and has suggested that tourism and diving stakeholders should increase their commitment and efforts to these programs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26200660/,2022-11-19 11:50:30 PM
Scuba diving is possible and safe for patients with haemophilia,"J F Schved, M De Haro, M Drapeau, M Schved, J F Schved, M De Haro, M Drapeau, M Schved",2012 Jan,"For a long time, physical activities have been contraindicated in haemophiliacs or were restricted to few activities. Sports are nowadays advocated for haemophiliacs. Although various lists of physical activities have been proposed, scuba diving is never mentioned. Thus, with a group of haemophilic volunteers, a study was launched on whether, with strict medical follow-up, scuba diving could be allowed for patients with haemophilia. All the participants followed a training program including theory and assessment. In 6 years, a total of 517 dives were performed by 20 patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Nine were under prophylaxis for haemophilia, and nine received on-demand treatment. Two patients had type I von Willebrand's disease. Among the 20 patients, 12 made 12-153 dives, whereas six made eight dives each. No incident was noted during or after the dives. Thus, scuba diving can be authorized for PWH, if they have none of the specific medical contraindications for diving and if they have received medical training allowing them to manage their disease themselves.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535321/,2022-11-19 11:50:31 PM
"A review of snorkelling and scuba diving fatalities in Queensland, Australia, 2000 to 2019","John Lippmann, John Lippmann",2022 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study examined all known diving-related fatalities in Queensland, Australia, from 2000 to 2019 to determine likely causes and potential countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were extracted from the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation fatality database, including previously published reports. The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify diving-related deaths in Queensland for 2014-2019 and data were extracted, analysed, and combined with previously published data covering the period 2000-2013. Descriptive statistics and parametric and non-parametric tests were used to analyse these data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 166 snorkelling and 41 scuba victims identified with median ages of 59 and 49 years respectively, and 83% of snorkel and 64% of scuba victims were males. One quarter of snorkel and 40% of scuba victims were obese. Two-thirds of the snorkellers and three quarters of scuba divers were overseas tourists. Contributory predisposing health conditions were identified in 61% of snorkel and 50% of scuba victims. Nine scuba victims died on their first dive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The increase in snorkelling deaths likely reflects increased participation, higher age, and poorer health. The main disabling condition in both cohorts was cardiac-related. Pre-existing health conditions, poor skills, inexperience, poor planning, supervision shortcomings and lack of effective buddy systems featured in both cohorts, and apnoeic hypoxia in breath-hold divers. Suggested countermeasures include improved education on the importance of health and fitness for safe diving and snorkelling, increased emphasis on an honest and accurate pre-activity health declaration and subsequent implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies, improved supervision, better buddy pairing, and on-going education on the hazards of extended apnoea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732283/,2022-11-19 11:50:32 PM
"A 20-year analysis of compressed gas diving-related deaths in Tasmania, Australia","Juan Carlos Ascencio-Lane, David Smart, John Lippmann, Juan Carlos Ascencio-Lane, David Smart, John Lippmann",2019 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study reviews diving deaths that occurred in Tasmanian waters over a 20-year period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Detailed analysis was undertaken of deaths that occurred from 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2014. The cases were collated from numerous sources. Utilising a chain of events analysis, factors were identified and assigned to predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and cause of death. These were then scrutinised to ascertain regional variables, remediable factors and linkages which may benefit from targeted risk mitigation strategies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventeen deaths were identified across this 20-year period, which included one additional case not previously recorded. All were recreational divers and 15 were male. Five were hookah divers, 12 were scuba divers. Important predisposing factors identified included equipment (condition and maintenance), pre-existing health conditions, diver experience and training. These factors can now be used to promote public health messages for divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This 20-year study highlighted regional variations for Tasmanian deaths and presents opportunities for strategies to prevent diving deaths in the future. Of particular concern was the diving practice of 'hookah' diving, which has no governing regulations. The study highlighted the importance of applying a structured methodology such as chain of events analysis to scrutinise diving deaths.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30856664/,2022-11-19 11:50:33 PM
Breathing through a diving snorkel; theory and experiment of air flow resistance and cost of breathing,"N A M Schellart, N A M Schellart",2021 First-Quarter,"The snorkel allows a surface swimmer to observe the underwater world through the face mask without being disturbed by inhaling. The effect of a snorkel on breathing resistance and cost is widely held to be substantial. This study aims to model these parameters and to measure indirectly the actual increases. Further, resistances of differing designs and dimensions were assessed and recommendations were made concerning use and choice. Maximal voluntary ventilation in 12 seconds (MVV12) was measured in 19 volunteers seated on dry land with and without a classic J-type snorkel (inner diameter 20.5 mm). The extra and total resistances and costs were calculated using the MVV12 data and using estimated airways resistance extrapolated from subject's demography and spirometric literature data. MVV12 measurements with snorkel showed a minute volume of 152 ±38 L∙min-1, 6.0 ±3.7% lower than without snorkel (p = 7.0x10-6). The theoretical MVV12, calculated from snorkel and airways resistances, decreased by 3.2%. Experimental total breathing resistance (457±83 Pa∙s∙L-1) was 6.5 ± 3.2% higher than without snorkel (p = 2.6x10-7), but the total mechanical breathing cost was unaffected by the snorkel (13.58 Watts with; 13.64 Watts without). Divers' estimations of resistance increase were exaggerated (8.8% at rest, 23% swimming). Classical J-type snorkels with an inner diameter ≥19.5 mm add 3-16% resistance . There is no risk of hypercapnia. Scuba divers are recommended to use their snorkel to breathe more comfortably on the surface. It is recommended the snorkel be made a mandatory safety accessory. The best multipurpose snorkel (19-21 mm) has no top appendages and no water release valve.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33648037/,2022-11-19 11:50:34 PM
The impact of regular diving on the condition of the middle ear,"Olgierd Stieler, Wawrzyniec Loba, Wojciech Gawęcki, Marta Urbaniak-Olejnik, Anna Majewska, Wojciech Warchoł, Dorota Hojan-Jezierska, Olgierd Stieler, Wawrzyniec Loba, Wojciech Gawęcki, Marta Urbaniak-Olejnik, Anna Majewska, Wojciech Warchoł, Dorota Hojan-Jezierska",2021 Dec 13,"Objectives:
        
      
      It is generally held that exposure to both high-pressure and long-lasting contact with water makes diving a potentially hazardous sports activity as far as the ears are concerned. There is a number of research investigating the condition of the middle ear in a short period following diving; however, the knowledge regarding the long-term effects of regularly repeated diving remains limited.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the function of the middle ear after a diving season in a group of 31 adults diving regularly (1-17 years) by means of the following methods: 1) interview, 2) otoscopy, 3) pure tone audiometry, 4) classic tympanometry, and 5) wideband tympanometry.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Periodic problems with pressure equalization in the middle ear were observed in 12 individuals (38.7%). In all the analyzed cases, the authors found a normal condition of the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane in otoscopy, normal hearing in pure tone audiometry, curve type A, and normal gradient in both classic and wideband tympanometry.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Safe diving (according to safety precautions) does not have any long-term negative effects on the condition of the middle ear. However, these observations should be verified in a larger group of divers.

Enriched Air Nitrox Breathing Reduces Venous Gas Bubbles after Simulated SCUBA Diving: A Double-Blind Cross-Over Randomized Trial,"Vincent Souday, Nick J Koning, Bruno Perez, Fabien Grelon, Alain Mercat, Christa Boer, Valérie Seegers, Peter Radermacher, Pierre Asfar, Vincent Souday, Nick J Koning, Bruno Perez, Fabien Grelon, Alain Mercat, Christa Boer, Valérie Seegers, Peter Radermacher, Pierre Asfar",2016 May 10,"Objective:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis whether enriched air nitrox (EAN) breathing during simulated diving reduces decompression stress when compared to compressed air breathing as assessed by intravascular bubble formation after decompression.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Human volunteers underwent a first simulated dive breathing compressed air to include subjects prone to post-decompression venous gas bubbling. Twelve subjects prone to bubbling underwent a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial including one simulated dive breathing compressed air, and one dive breathing EAN (36% O2) in a hyperbaric chamber, with identical diving profiles (28 msw for 55 minutes). Intravascular bubble formation was assessed after decompression using pulmonary artery pulsed Doppler.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve subjects showing high bubble production were included for the cross-over trial, and all completed the experimental protocol. In the randomized protocol, EAN significantly reduced the bubble score at all time points (cumulative bubble scores: 1 [0-3.5] vs. 8 [4.5-10]; P < 0.001). Three decompression incidents, all presenting as cutaneous itching, occurred in the air versus zero in the EAN group (P = 0.217). Weak correlations were observed between bubble scores and age or body mass index, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      EAN breathing markedly reduces venous gas bubble emboli after decompression in volunteers selected for susceptibility for intravascular bubble formation. When using similar diving profiles and avoiding oxygen toxicity limits, EAN increases safety of diving as compared to compressed air breathing.

Immersion pulmonary edema: case reports from Oceania,"Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock, Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock",2019,"Introduction:
        
      
      We aimed to document identified cases of immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) in divers from Oceania (the Indo-Pacific region) from January 2002 to May 2018, inclusive.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Cases were identified using various sources, including searches of the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) Fatality Database, published case reports, and interviews with survivors who had reported their incident to DAN AP. Where available, investigations, pathology and autopsy results were obtained. Only incidents diagnosed as IPE by diving physicians or pathologists with experience in the investigation of diving accidents were included. Individual case histories and outcomes, together with brief individual summaries of the associations and possible contributing factors were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one IPE incidents in divers from Oceania were documented. There were two surface snorkelers, 22 scuba air divers and seven nitrox divers which included three closed-circuit rebreathers (CCR). The mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years, 58% of victims were females, and the average dive profile was to a maximum depth of 19 meters of seawater for 25 minutes. Six victims (19%) had previous episodes of IPE. There were nine recorded fatalities. Cardiac anomalies dominated the associated or possible contributing factors. These included valvular disease in 29%, transient cardiomyopathies in 26% and dysrhythmias in 16%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Previously reported associations of IPE such as exertion, stress, cold exposure, negative inspiratory pressure, hypertension, overhydration, ascent or surfacing, tight wetsuit, aspiration and certain medications were identified. Cardiac conditions were frequent and included chronic disorders (valvular pathology, coronary artery disease) and transient disorders (dysrhythmias, transient myocardial dysfunction, takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy). It is likely that the chronic cardiac disorders may have contributed to the IPE, whereas the transient cases could be either sequelae, contributors or coincidental to the IPE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683356/,2022-11-19 11:50:37 PM
A day in the life of a diabetic diver: the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society/Divers Alert Network protocol for diving with diabetes in action,"Rebecca Johnson, Rebecca Johnson",2016 Sep,"Some people with well-managed insulin-dependent diabetes can dive safely. Those cleared to participate should control tightly the variables that impact blood glucose levels, including activity, timing, food and insulin. Honest self-assessment is critical. A diabetic diver should cancel a dive if seasick, unusually anxious, or following significant high or low blood glucose levels in the preceding 24 hours. The diver should enter the water with a blood glucose level above 8.3 mmol·L⁻¹ and below 14 mmol·L⁻¹ with a stable or rising trend in blood glucose established with glucose tests at 90, 60, and 30 minutes prior to a dive. The diver should carry emergency glucose at all times and brief dive buddies about hypoglycaemia procedures. This is a personal account of the author's experience diving with type 1 diabetes and details how the UHMS/DAN recommendations are put into practice on dive days. Key elements of the self-assessment process, long- and rapid-acting insulin adjustments, meal timing, responses to blood glucose trends, handling hypoglycaemia and approaching multi-dive days are described.

Assessment of fitness for recreational scuba diving in candidates with asthma: a pilot study,"Amalie Ustrup, Signe Knag Pedersen, Charlotte Suppli Ulrik, Amalie Ustrup, Signe Knag Pedersen, Charlotte Suppli Ulrik",2020 Jan 15,"Background:
        
      
      Asthma may be regarded as a contraindication to scuba diving.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      A clinical algorithm to assess fitness to dive among individuals with asthma was developed and tested prospectively in clinical practice.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Cohort study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All patients with possible asthma referred to Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark, for assessment of fitness to dive over a 5-year period (2013-2017) were included. Fitness to dive was assessed by case history, spirometry and mannitol challenge test. All patients with ≥10% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (at any point during the challenge test) were offered step-up asthma therapy and rechallenge after at least 3 months. Patients with <10% decline in FEV1 after administration of a maximum dose of mannitol at the latest challenge were classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study cohort comprised 41 patients (24 men; mean age 33 years), of whom 71% and 63% of men and women, respectively, were treated with rescue bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid. After the first mannitol challenge test, 21 patients were classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving, of whom 16 were currently prescribed asthma medication. After step-up asthma therapy and rechallenge test, an additional seven patients were classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving. Overall, using this clinical algorithm, 28 (68%) of the referred patients were finally assessed as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Using a clinical algorithm with mannitol challenge to assess fitness to dive among patients with possible asthma and allowing a rechallenge test after step-up asthma therapy increased the proportion of individuals classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving. However, as this algorithm has so far not been evaluated against actual scuba diving safety, further studies are clearly needed before it can be implemented with confidence for use in clinical practice.
    


          Clinical relevance:

Recreational technical diving part 1: an introduction to technical diving methods and activities,"Simon J Mitchell, David J Doolette, Simon J Mitchell, David J Doolette",2013 Jun,"Technical divers use gases other than air and advanced equipment configurations to conduct dives that are deeper and/or longer than typical recreational air dives. The use of oxygen-nitrogen (nitrox) mixes with oxygen fractions higher than air results in longer no-decompression limits for shallow diving, and faster decompression from deeper dives. For depths beyond the air-diving range, technical divers mix helium, a light non-narcotic gas, with nitrogen and oxygen to produce 'trimix'. These blends are tailored to the depth of intended use with a fraction of oxygen calculated to produce an inspired oxygen partial pressure unlikely to cause cerebral oxygen toxicity and a nitrogen fraction calculated to produce a tolerable degree of nitrogen narcosis. A typical deep technical dive will involve the use of trimix at the target depth with changes to gases containing more oxygen and less inert gas during the decompression. Open-circuit scuba may be used to carry and utilise such gases, but this is very wasteful of expensive helium. There is increasing use of closed-circuit 'rebreather' devices. These recycle expired gas and potentially limit gas consumption to a small amount of inert gas to maintain the volume of the breathing circuit during descent and the amount of oxygen metabolised by the diver. This paper reviews the basic approach to planning and execution of dives using these methods to better inform physicians of the physical demands and risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813462/,2022-11-19 11:50:40 PM
Exercise-Related Effects on Executive Functions During a Simulated Underwater Extravehicular Activity,"Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Tobias Vogt, Fabian Steinberg, Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Tobias Vogt, Fabian Steinberg",2021 Aug 2,"Objective:
        
      
      Investigation of cognitive performance during extravehicular activities (EVAs) in a space-analog setting.
    


          Background:
        
      
      EVAs performed by humans in microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS) call for high cognitive performance during upper-body workload. Higher cardiovascular demands interact with cognitive performance, but no knowledge exists about EVA's special requirements. This study simulates EVA-training underwater to investigate its effects on the executive functions inhibition and switching.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In a counterbalanced crossover design, 16 divers (age: 28 ± 2.4 years; eight females) performed two conditions (i.e., EVA vs. Inactivity [INACT]) in 3-5 m submersion (diving gear; not in a space-suit). EVA included 30 min of moderate-, followed by 30 min of high-intensity upper-body exercise intervals, paired with EVA-specific cognitive-motor tasks. INACT included no exercise in submersion and neutral buoyancy. Both conditions included cognitive testing at pre, mid (after the first 30 min), and post (after the second 30 min) on a tablet computer. Reaction times (RTs) and response accuracy (ACC) were calculated for both tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ACC was significantly lower during EVA compared with INACT for inhibition (post: p = .009) and switching (mid: p = .019) at post (p = .005). RTs for inhibition were significantly faster during EVA (p = .022; ηp 2 = 0.320).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Specific physical exercise, intensity, duration, and tasks performed during the EVA might differently affect the exercise-cognition interaction and need further investigation, especially for future long-term space travel.

Regular medication use by active scuba divers with a declared comorbid medical condition and victims of scuba and snorkelling-related fatalities,"Simone E Taylor, David M Taylor, Daisy Pisasale, Kyle Booth, John Lippmann, Simone E Taylor, David M Taylor, Daisy Pisasale, Kyle Booth, John Lippmann",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to describe the nature of regular medications taken by active comorbid scuba divers (having a declared medical comorbidity) and scuba divers and snorkellers who died following a diving incident.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We undertook a retrospective, observational study from July to October, 2020. Data on 268 active comorbid divers were obtained through a 2013 survey of Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific members. Data on 126 deceased scuba divers and 175 deceased snorkellers were obtained predominantly from 2001-2013 reports to Australian State Coronial Services.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The active comorbid divers were significantly older, less likely to be male, and more likely to be taking one or more medications than the two deceased subject groups (P < 0.001). Cardiovascular, endocrine and psychotropic medications accounted for 53.4%, 9.9% and 6.4% of all medications taken, respectively. Almost one tenth of the deceased divers took at least one psychotropic medication, a proportion significantly greater than the other groups (P = 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medication use among active comorbid divers is common which likely reflects their declared medical condition. Nevertheless, they appear to be diving relatively safely, often with conditions once thought to be absolute contradictions to scuba diving. The deceased divers took significantly more psychotropic medications. It is possible that their underlying psychological/psychiatric conditions rendered them more at risk of a diving incident. Increased vigilance for psychological conditions may need to be considered during diving medical examinations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547777/,2022-11-19 11:50:42 PM

Tooth fracture or failure of dental restoration usually appears in a tooth with a leaking restoration or secondary caries lesion. In addition, changes in barometric pressure can cause a reduction in the retention of dental restoration and appliance. Barodontalgia is the oral pain which evoked during changes of the atmospheric pressure. This manifestation can be classified as a direct or non-direct pain. In most cases, the direct pain is caused by deterioration of pre-existed oral disease, whereas the source of the nondirect pain is an extra-oral facial barotrauma.

Coronial findings, witness and police reports, medical histories and autopsies, toxicology and equipment reports were scrutinised. These were analysed for predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and causes of death using a validated template.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 known scuba diving fatalities and 189 predisposing factors were identified, the major being health conditions (59; 47%), organisational/training/experience/skills issues (46; 37%), planning shortcomings (29; 23%) and equipment inadequacies (24; 19%). The 138 suspected triggers included environmental (68; 54%), exertion (23; 18%) and gas supply problems (15; 12%) among others. The 121 identified disabling agents included medical-related (48; 38%), ascent-related (21; 17%), poor buoyancy control (18; 14%), gas supply (17; 13%), environmental (13; 10%) and equipment (4; 3%). The main disabling injuries were asphyxia (37%), cardiac (25%) and cerebral arterial gas embolism/pulmonary barotrauma (15%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Chronic medical conditions, predominantly cardiac-related, are a major contributor to diving incidents. Divers with such conditions and/or older divers should undergo thorough fitness-to-dive assessments. Appropriate local knowledge, planning and monitoring are important to minimise the potential for incidents triggered by adverse environmental conditions, most of which involve inexperienced divers. Chain of events analysis should increase understanding of diving incidents and has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957123/,2022-11-19 11:50:44 PM
"Rescue and resuscitation factors in scuba diving and snorkeling fatalities in Australia, 2001-2013","John Lippmann, John Lippmann",2020 First-Quarter,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to examine first aid measures applied in a large series of Australian dive-related fatalities to better determine where improvements can be made.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify scuba diving and snorkeling-related cases reported to various Australian Coroners for the years 2001-2013 inclusive. Coronial documents examined included witness statements, police reports and ambulance and medical reports where available. Information relating to the recovery, rescue and/or resuscitation of the victims was extracted, compiled and analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      126 scuba diving and 175 snorkeling-related fatalities were identified during the study period, with airway management complications reported in one-third. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in three-quarters of the incidents. An automated external defibrillator was attached to 40 victims as a first aid measure, and shocks were indicated and delivered in five cases. Although three-quarters of the reports included no information about whether supplemental oxygen was provided, it was confirmed in 19% of both the scuba diving and snorkeling incidents.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There were often considerable delays in the recognition, rescue and/or recovery of an unconscious snorkeler or diver and, consequently, the time to commencement of basic life support. Such delays can affect chances of survival and need to be minimized. Delivery of supplemental oxygen during resuscitation appears to be relatively infrequent and sometimes suboptimal; improvement appears necessary. Some measures that would have improved availability and/or better use in these cases include the selection of appropriate equipment compatible with likely circumstances and operator skills; improved training and ongoing skills practice; and regular checking and maintenance of equipment. Improved data collection and recording by official on-site investigators, preferably with knowledge of diving, would better inform potential or necessary improvements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32176951/,2022-11-19 11:50:44 PM
Increasing the probability of surviving loss of consciousness underwater when using a rebreather,"Paul Haynes, Paul Haynes",2016 Dec,"Re-circulating underwater breathing apparatus (rebreathers) have become increasingly popular amongst sport divers. In comparison to open-circuit scuba, rebreathers are complex life support equipment that incorporates many inherent failure modes and potential for human error. This individually or in combination can lead to an inappropriate breathing gas. Analysis of rebreather diving incidents suggests that inappropriate breathing gas is the most prevalent disabling agent. This can result in spontaneous loss of consciousness (LoC), water aspiration and drowning. Protecting the airway by maintaining the diver/rebreather oral interface may delay water aspiration following LoC underwater; the possibility of a successful rescue is, thus, increased. One means of protecting the airway following LoC underwater is the use of a full-face mask (FFM). However, such masks are complex and expensive; therefore, they have not been widely adopted by the sport diving community. An alternative to the FFM used extensively throughout the global military diving community is the mouthpiece retaining strap (MRS). A recent study documented 54 LoC events in military rebreather diving with only three consequent drownings; all divers were reported to be using a MRS. Even allowing for the concomitant use of a tethered diving partner system in most cases, the low number of fatalities in this large series is circumstantially supportive of the efficacy of the MRS. Despite drowning featuring as a final common pathway in the vast majority of rebreather fatalities, the MRS has not been widely adopted by the sport rebreather diving community.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27966205/,2022-11-19 11:50:45 PM
Injury survey in scuba divers of British Sub-Aqua Club: A retrospective study,"Gwang-Suk Hyun, Yong-Seok Jee, Jung-Min Park, Nam-Heung Cho, Jun-Youl Cha, Gwang-Suk Hyun, Yong-Seok Jee, Jung-Min Park, Nam-Heung Cho, Jun-Youl Cha",2015 Dec 31,"Scuba diving itself is generally known as a safe sports. However, various injury accidents can happen, and the incidences vary depending on divers' education grade levels about the risks. Therefore, the study set out to identify and analyze the causes and patterns of injuries depending on the divers' safety education grade levels through a questionnaire survey targeting ocean divers (n=12), sports divers (n=16), and dive leaders (n=15), all of whom belong to the British Sub-Aqua Club. After conducting a frequency analysis on the collected questionnaires, the conclusions are made as follows. First, in terms of diving depth, the most frequent diving depth was 15-20 m among ocean divers, 20-25 m among sports divers, and 15-20 m in case of dive leaders. Second, with regard to the causes of injuries, the most frequently answered causes are 'overtension' and 'low skill' among ocean divers; 'low skill' among sports divers; 'overaction' among dive leaders. Third, in terms of injury patterns, the most frequently answered injury patterns are 'ear' injuries among ocean divers; 'ankle' injuries among sports divers; 'ankle' and 'calf' injuries among dive leaders. Fourth, with regard to who performed first-aid when an injury accident happened, the most frequent answers are 'instructor' among ocean divers; 'instructor' and 'self' among sports divers; 'self' among dive leaders. We might suggest that more efforts need to be made to improve divers' low dependence on specialists for treatment and consultation so that we can prevent an injury from leading to the second injury accident.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26730384/,2022-11-19 11:50:46 PM
Chain of events analysis for a scuba diving fatality,"John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, Jo Williams, Mohammadreza Mohebbi, John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, Jo Williams, Mohammadreza Mohebbi",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      A scuba diving fatality usually involves a series of related events culminating in death. Several studies have utilised a chain of events-type analysis (CEA) to isolate and better understand the accident sequence in order to facilitate the creation of relevant countermeasures. The aim of this research was to further develop and better define a process for performing a CEA to reduce potential subjectivity and increase consistency between analysts.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      To develop more comprehensive and better-defined criteria, existing criteria were modified and a template was created and tested using a CEA. Modifications comprised addition of a category for pre-disposing factors, expansion of criteria for the triggers and disabling agents present during the incident, and more specific inclusion criteria to better encompass a dataset of 56 fatalities. Four investigators (raters) used both the previous criteria and this template, in randomly assigned order, to examine a sample of 13 scuba diver deaths. Individual results were scored against the group consensus for the CEA. Raters' agreement consistency was compared using the Index of Concordance and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The template is presented. The index of concordance between the raters increased from 62% (194⁄312) using the previous criteria to 82% (257⁄312) with use of this template indicating a substantially higher inter-rater agreement when allocating criteria. The agreement in scoring with and without template use was also quantified by ICC which were generally graded as low, illustrating a substantial change in consistency of scoring before and after template use.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The template for a CEA for a scuba diving fatality improves consistency of interpretation between users and may improve comparability of diving fatality reports.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868594/,2022-11-19 11:50:47 PM
Fatal air embolism in a breath-hold diver,"Neil Dg Banham, John Lippmann, Neil Dg Banham, John Lippmann",2019 Dec 20,"Cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) from breath-holding or inadequate exhalation during ascent is a well-recognised complication of scuba diving. It does not usually occur with breath-hold (BH) diving in those with normal lungs, as the volume of gas in the lungs on surfacing cannot exceed what it was on leaving the surface. However, a BH diver who breathes from a compressed gas supply at depth essentially becomes a scuba diver and is at risk of pulmonary barotrauma (PBt) and CAGE on ascent. In this case, a 26-year-old male experienced BH diver breathed from a scuba set at approximately 10 metres' sea water depth and ascended, sustaining massive PBt and CAGE with a fatal outcome. BH and scuba divers, especially those with less experience, need to be well-informed about this potential risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31828750/,2022-11-19 11:50:47 PM
[Medical screening of persons with diabetes mellitus before allowing recreative diving activity],"Gladis Helledie, Julie Vinkel, Erik Christiansen, Ole Hyldegaard, Gladis Helledie, Julie Vinkel, Erik Christiansen, Ole Hyldegaard",2019 Jan 14,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) was previously considered a contraindication to recreational diving by means of self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), the main concern being the risk of the divers developing underwater hypoglycaemia. However, an increasing body of scientific evidence including epidemiologic surveys and controlled case studies have shown, that some patients with DM can dive safely under the right circumstances. In this review, we summarise the Danish national guidelines based on existing literature and guidelines as well as patient instructions on how to improve safety when diving with DM.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686284/,2022-11-19 11:50:48 PM
