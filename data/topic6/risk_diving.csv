Breath-Hold Diving,"John R Fitz-Clarke, John R Fitz-Clarke",2018 Mar 25,"Breath-hold diving is practiced by recreational divers, seafood divers, military divers, and competitive athletes. It involves highly integrated physiology and extreme responses. This article reviews human breath-hold diving physiology beginning with an historical overview followed by a summary of foundational research and a survey of some contemporary issues. Immersion and cardiovascular adjustments promote a blood shift into the heart and chest vasculature. Autonomic responses include diving bradycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, and splenic contraction, which help conserve oxygen. Competitive divers use a technique of lung hyperinflation that raises initial volume and airway pressure to facilitate longer apnea times and greater depths. Gas compression at depth leads to sequential alveolar collapse. Airway pressure decreases with depth and becomes negative relative to ambient due to limited chest compliance at low lung volumes, raising the risk of pulmonary injury called ""squeeze,"" characterized by postdive coughing, wheezing, and hemoptysis. Hypoxia and hypercapnia influence the terminal breakpoint beyond which voluntary apnea cannot be sustained. Ascent blackout due to hypoxia is a danger during long breath-holds, and has become common amongst high-level competitors who can suppress their urge to breathe. Decompression sickness due to nitrogen accumulation causing bubble formation can occur after multiple repetitive dives, or after single deep dives during depth record attempts. Humans experience responses similar to those seen in diving mammals, but to a lesser degree. The deepest sled-assisted breath-hold dive was to 214 m. Factors that might determine ultimate human depth capabilities are discussed. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

Effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction,"Joëlle Vincent, Marie-Kristelle Ross, Neal W Pollock, Joëlle Vincent, Marie-Kristelle Ross, Neal W Pollock",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) is available to a wide spectrum of patients, many with significant co-morbidities. Considering its effects on cardiac physiology and reports of pulmonary oedema following exposure, concerns exist about the safety of patients with compromised cardiac function. Few studies have described adverse events occurring during HBOT and even fewer reports address events arising in the hours following HBOT. A relation between adverse events and cardiac function has not been established. As medical guidance is limited, we aimed to evaluate the risk for patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) receiving HBOT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective chart review of patients receiving HBOT from April 2003 through December 2019 at our hospital was designed to describe clinical characteristics of patients and to identify adverse events during HBOT and within 24 hours after HBOT. Patients ≥ 40 years of age with a documented LVEF of ≤ 40% were included. Data are presented as mean (SD) [range] or counts, as appropriate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 23 patients were included in the final analysis, 2 (1) [0-4] patients per year. Patients received 25 (19) [1-60] treatments. Two patients had an episode of acute decompensated heart failure possibly linked to HBOT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study described the clinical characteristics of patients with reduced LVEF receiving HBOT and showed reassuring results, with a majority of patients with reduced LVEF tolerating HBOT well. Prospective research is required to more fully assess the risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547776/,2022-11-28 02:42:42 AM

In particular, AD risk alleles primarily affect the abundance or structure, and thus the activity, of genes expressed in macrophages, strongly implicating microglia (the brain-resident macrophages) in the etiology of AD. These genes converge on pathways (endocytosis/phagocytosis, cholesterol metabolism, and immune response) with critical roles in core macrophage functions such as efferocytosis. Here, we review these pathways, highlighting relevant genes identified in the latest AD genetics and genomics studies, and describe how they may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Investigating the functional impact of AD-associated variants and genes in microglia is essential for elucidating disease risk mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36327897/,2022-11-28 02:42:43 AM

In this study, we quantified the concentrations of essential (Cu, Zn) and toxic (Cd, Pb) elements in the muscle of 248 leopard groupers, Mycteroperca rosacea, captured by spearfishing and free diving close to a mining district in the Gulf of California during 2014-2015. We analysed metals using high-resolution inductively coupled plasma source mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). We analysed metal concentrations by fish size, sex, maturity, season, year and risk factor for human consumption. The results indicated common levels of essential elements (Cu: 11 ± 34.3 μg/g, Zn: 377 ± 1390 μg/g) in comparison with toxic elements (Cd: 0.06 ± 0.1 μg/g, Pb: 0.98 ± 1.5 μg/g). Cadmium was within the permissible limit of Mexican standards (0.5 μg/g), but lead content bordered its limit (1.0 μg/g). Heavy metal concentrations were comparable between males and females. Metal variations were not significantly correlated with sex, maturity, season or year (p > 0.05). The evaluation of benefits (daily mineral intake) and risks (target hazard quotients) to health indicated that these fish did not represent a risk of adverse effects to consumers within worldwide limits, while the nutritional benefits were high.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35048347/,2022-11-28 02:42:44 AM
Halitosis: could it be a predictor of stroke?,"Wei-Shih Tseng, Wei-Shih Tseng",2014 Mar,"Stroke is a medical emergency and can cause permanent neurological disability and death. Halitosis (bad breath) has been reported in many stroke patients. We speculated that this phenomenon may be present before as well as after a stroke. Moreover, many studies have shown that most of the causes of halitosis are also associated with an increased risk of stroke. Therefore, we hypothesized that the severity of halitosis could be a predictor of stroke. We hope that this hypothesis can be confirmed by further investigations, and that if confirmed it can be used as a tool to monitor disease control and/or early diagnosis and intervention of newly developed diseases related to both halitosis and stroke.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24472866/,2022-11-28 02:42:45 AM
Observational study of early diaphragm pacing in cervical spinal cord injured patients to decrease mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Raymond P Onders, MaryJo Elmo, Brian Young, Glen Tinkoff, Raymond P Onders, MaryJo Elmo, Brian Young, Glen Tinkoff",2022 Sep 7,"Background:
        
      
      Decreasing the burden of mechanical ventilation for spinal cord injuries was never more relevant than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data have shown diaphragm pacing can replace mechanical ventilation, decrease wean times, improve respiratory mechanics, and decrease hospital costs for patients with spinal cord injuries. This is the largest report of diaphragm pacing during the pandemic.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a retrospective analysis of prospective Institutional Review Board approved databases of nonrandomized interventional experience at a single institution. Subgroup analysis limited to traumatic cervical spinal cord injuries that were implanted laparoscopically with diaphragm electrodes within 30 days of injury.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the study group of early implanted traumatic cervical spinal cord injuries, 13 subjects were identified from a database of 197 diaphragm pacing implantations from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022, for all indications. All subjects were male with an average age of 49.3 years (range, 17-70). Injury mechanisms included falls (6), motor vehicle accident (4), gunshot wound (2), and diving (1). Time from injury to diaphragm pacing averaged 11 days (range, 3-22). Two patients are deceased and neither weaned from mechanical ventilation. Nine of the remaining 11 patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Four patients never had a tracheostomy and 3 additional patients had tracheostomy decannulation. Three of these high-risk pulmonary compromised patients survived COVID-19 infections utilizing diaphragm pacing.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Diaphragm pacing successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation 82% of patients surviving past 90 days. Forty-four percent of this group never underwent a tracheostomy. Only 22% of the weaned group required long term tracheostomies. Early diaphragm pacing for spinal cord injuries decreases mechanical ventilation usage and tracheostomy need which allows for earlier placement for rehabilitation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36266119/,2022-11-28 02:42:45 AM

After 1 h of diving operation at 20 m below sea level, he complained of dyspnea, chest pain, and abdominal pain. He dove again, intending to ease the symptoms, but the symptoms were never relieved. He dove for a total of 4 h. No neurological abnormalities were observed. Computed tomography images revealed portal venous gas and mesenteric venous gas, in addition to bubbles in the femoral veins, pelvis, lumbar canal, intracranial sinuses, and joints. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was immediately administered. His symptoms improved after the first course of HBOT, however, the patient had anuria for almost 36 h after admission and exhibited acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum creatinine and creatine kinase (CK) levels were increased to maximal values of 6.16 mg/dL and 18,963 U/L, respectively. Blood flow signals were not detected on kidney Doppler ultrasound. We considered that AKI was caused by blood flow impairment and capillary leak syndrome due to DCI in addition to rhabdomyolysis secondary to arterial gas embolism in the skeletal muscles. Temporary dialysis was required to correct the acidemia and electrolyte disturbance. Diuretic phase was initiated, and the patient was put off dialysis on day 3. Serum creatinine and CK levels returned to normal on day 11. He was successfully treated without any complications. Although AKI is a rare manifestation, we should consider AKI risk in patients with severe DCI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28900861/,2022-11-28 02:42:46 AM
[The Traumatic Tympanic Membrane Perforation - Aetiology and Therapy],"F Kraus, R Hagen, F Kraus, R Hagen",2015 Sep,"Background:
        
      
      The use of cotton swabs is well known as a cause of a traumatic membrane perforation. More reasons are known. A detailed description of the aetiology and therapy in Germany does not exist. The treatment consist of a readaptation of the perforation an splinting of the tympanic membrane with paper sheets or silicon foils.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      238 patients with an acute tympanic membrane perforation were included in this retrospective study. They were treated between 2005 and 2010.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean causes of a traumatic tympanic membrane perforation were slaps with the open hand (37.4%), the use of a cotton swab (19.3%) and high diving (13.0%). The perforations have been splinted with paper sheets or silicon foils. The rate of complete wound closure after splinting with different materials are comparable (71.9% and 81.8%). The side effects are low.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the first study about the aetiology of traumatic tympanic membrane perforations in Germany. There is no statistic difference between the 2 materials for tympanic membrane splinting. A traumatic tympanic membrane perforation should be treatet at least to improve the air conduction threshold.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25565334/,2022-11-28 02:42:47 AM

Four male divers took part in the experiment. During the study the divers' choice reaction time as well as plasma concentration of adrenaline, noradrenaline and lactate were measured. The measurements were carried out before immersion (before a warm-up), three minutes after the dive, and 60 minutes after the dive. A reduction in the reaction time to audiovisual stimuli was found in three divers, three minutes after the dive. Diver 4, who broke his personal best record, had a longer choice reaction time at three minutes after the dive. The adrenaline concentration was lowered in Diver 1 and Diver 2, at three minutes after the dive. The adrenaline level in Diver 3 was relatively steady at all test measurements. In Diver 4, who broke his personal best, a twofold increase in adrenaline concentration was noted at three minutes after the dive. All examined divers revealed an increase in noradrenaline blood level at three minutes after the dive. The results of the study are of great practical value since disturbed reactions during freediving can put the diver at the risk of serious barotraumas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24851548/,2022-11-28 02:45:01 AM
Running the gauntlet: regional movement patterns of Manta alfredi through a complex of parks and fisheries,"Elitza S Germanov, Andrea D Marshall, Elitza S Germanov, Andrea D Marshall",2014 Oct 22,"Manta rays (Genus Manta) are economically important for fisheries and tourism in Indonesia. These species have been listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List as Vulnerable to extinction; therefore, human exploitation of manta rays must be regulated. A better understanding of the habitat use and movement patterns of manta rays in Indonesia is needed in order to employ effective conservation measures. To gain better insight into the movements of Manta alfredi we used 'Manta Matcher', an online database with an integrated automated matching algorithm, to compare photographs from 2,604 encounters of M. alfredi collected by recreational divers and dive operators throughout Indonesia over a nine-year period. This photographic comparison revealed that manta rays migrated between regional sanctuaries such as Nusa Penida, the Gili Islands, and the Komodo National Park (up to 450 km straight-line distance). The areas between these sanctuaries are heavily fished and trafficked by ships, and when manta rays travel through these regions they risk being fished and injured by ship strikes. These long-range manta ray movements suggest connectivity between M. alfredi populations in neighboring islands and raise concerns about the future management of regional populations. It is recommended that a national conservation strategy be developed to protect the remaining populations in the country.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25337865/,2022-11-28 02:45:02 AM
Chronic Disease Management in Sickle Cell Trait Patients in the Primary Care Setting: A Case Report,"Rachel N Fields, Suzanne Minor, Rachel N Fields, Suzanne Minor",2020 Oct 30,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a heterogeneous group of inherited hemoglobinopathies associated with mutations in the beta subunit of the hemoglobin protein. Several case reports and scientific reviews of the current literature have been published that indicate individuals having a single copy of the mutant sickle cell allele, known as sickle cell trait (SCT), can experience the same functional asplenia and increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents, kidney disease, cardiovascular effects, and veno-occlusive diseases as SCD patients when they are exposed to extreme conditions and stressful environments such as high-altitude, deep-sea diving, and intense physical activity.

Audit of practice in Australasian hyperbaric units on the incidence of central nervous system oxygen toxicity,"Susannah Sherlock, Mandy Way, Alexis Tabah, Susannah Sherlock, Mandy Way, Alexis Tabah",2018 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT) is an uncommon complication of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). Different facilities have developed local protocols in an attempt to reduce the risk of CNS-OT. This audit was performed to elucidate which protocols might be of benefit in mitigating CNS-OT and to open discussion on adopting a common protocol for Treatment Table 14 (TT14) to enable future multicentre clinical trials.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Audit of CNS-OT events between units using different compression profiles for TT14, performed at 243 kPa with variable durations of oxygen breathing and 'air breaks', to assess whether there is a statistical diference between protocols. Data were collected retrospectively from public and private hyperbaric facilities in Australia and New Zealand between 01 January 2010 and 31 December 2014.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight of 15 units approached participated. During the five-year period 5,193 patients received 96,670 treatments. There were a total of 38 seizures in 33 patients when all treatment pressures were examined. In the group of patients treated at 243 kPa there were a total of 26 seizures in 23 patients. The incidence of seizure per treatment was 0.024% (2.4 per 10,000 treatments) at 243 kPa and the risk per patient was 0.45% (4.5 in 1,000 patients). There were no statistically significant differences between the incidences of CNS-OT using different TT14 protocols in this analysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      HBOT is safe and CNS-OT is uncommon. The risk of CNS-OT per patient at 243 kPa was 1 in 222 (0.45%; range 0-1%) and the overall risk irrespective of treatment table was 0.6% (range 0.31-1.8%). These figures are higher than previously reported as they represent individual patient risk as opposed to risk per treatment. The wide disparity of facility protocols for a 243 kPa table without discernible influence on the incidence of CNS-OT rates should facilitate a national approach to consensus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888378/,2022-11-28 02:45:03 AM
Influence of a combo side airbag on the risk for basilar skull fracture in a far-side occupant,"David C Viano, Roger Burnett, Chantal S Parenteau, David C Viano, Roger Burnett, Chantal S Parenteau",2014,"Objective:
        
      
      The impact force to the head and neck were measured in sled tests with and without inflation of a combo airbag for a far-side occupant to determine the risk for basilar skull fracture.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sled tests were run at 24 and 32 km/h (15 and 20 mph) with and without inflation of a combo side airbag to analyze the effect of cross-car diving into the side interior. The matched tests involved one pair at 24 km/h and another at 32 km/h. The 24 km/h pair involved a lap-shoulder-belted 5th percentile female Hybrid III and the series at 32 km/h involved an unbelted 5th percentile Hybrid III. The dummy was ballasted to 69.5 kg (153 lb) and laid on the right side. The dummy was positioned 30.5 cm (12(″)) from the far-side interior to ensure the full sled delta V occurred before head impact. The buck consisted of a 2001 Ford Taurus. The combo thorax-head side airbag was stored in the seatback. The airbag was triggered about 120 ms before the head impact. The head, chest, and pelvis were instrumented with triaxial accelerometers and the upper and lower neck, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine had transducers measuring triaxial loads and moments. High-speed video recorded different views of the dummy motion. Dummy kinematics and biomechanical responses were compared to study the influence of inflating the side airbag on the head and neck.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The top of the head impacted the far side. The force of impact was similar with and without the airbag as the head compressed the airbag and loaded the vehicle interior trim behind the airbag. The peak force on the head was primarily from neck load as torso augmentation occurred. For the 24 km/h (15 mph) tests, the peak force was 4.7 kN (1055 lb) without and 4.8 kN (1088 lb) with the airbag and there was over 2.67 kN (600 lb) of lap belt load. The peak head acceleration was 93 g without and 72 g with the airbag. For the 32 km/h (20 mph) tests, the force on the head was 15.3 kN (3433 lb) without and 15.2 kN (3406 lb) with the airbag, although the instrumentation saturated. The peak head acceleration was 236 g without and 262 g with the airbag.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The airbag reduced head acceleration in the belted test but did not influence the diving forces from torso augmentation through the neck of the far-side occupant. The side airbag did not reduce the risk for basilar skull fracture due to high neck compression loads in either the belted or unbelted tests.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24433103/,2022-11-28 02:45:04 AM
Citalopram-Induced Long QT Syndrome and the Mammalian Dive Reflex,"Frank F Vincenzi, Philippe Lunetta, Frank F Vincenzi, Philippe Lunetta",2015 Dec,"While SCUBA diving, a 44-year-old Caucasian patient had an abnormal cardiac rhythm, presumably Torsade de Pointes (TdP), during the initial descent to depth. Upon surfacing, she developed ventricular fibrillation and died. The patient had been treated for mild depression for nearly a year with citalopram 60 mg per day, a drug known to cause prolonged QT interval. She had also been treated with two potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Liver impairment causes selective loss of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 activity, the major pathway for metabolism of citalopram. The post mortem blood level of citalopram was 1300 ng/mL. The patient was found to be an intermediate metabolizer via CYP2D6, the major pathway for metabolism of desmethylcitalopram; the level of which was also abnormally high. It is suggested that drug-induced long QT syndrome (DILQTS), caused by citalopram, combined with the mammalian dive reflex triggered malignant ventricular rhythms resulting in the patient's death. It is further suggested that, in general, the dive reflex increases the risk of fatal cardiac rhythms when the QT interval is prolonged by drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27747724/,2022-11-28 02:45:05 AM

This study quantified phthalates in seabirds collected across >1700 km of the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and contributes to a body of knowledge on plastic contaminants in marine wildlife. We measured six phthalate congeners in seabirds representing ten species and four feeding guilds. Phthalates were detected in 100% of specimens (n = 115), but varied among individuals (3.64-539.64 ng/g). DEHP and DBP occurred at an order of magnitude higher than other congeners. Total phthalates did not vary geographically, but differed among feeding guilds, with significantly higher concentrations in diving plankton-feeders compared to others. Plastic particles were detected in 36.5% of randomly subsampled seabird stomachs (n = 74), suggesting plastic ingestion as a potential route of phthalate exposure.

Operative Treatment of Cervical Spine Injuries Sustained in Youth Sports,"Bram P Verhofste, Daniel J Hedequist, Craig M Birch, Emily S Rademacher, Michael P Glotzbecker, Mark R Proctor, Yi-Meng Yen, Bram P Verhofste, Daniel J Hedequist, Craig M Birch, Emily S Rademacher, Michael P Glotzbecker, Mark R Proctor, Yi-Meng Yen",2021 Nov-Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Little data exists on surgical outcomes of sports-related cervical spine injuries (CSI) sustained in children and adolescent athletes. This study reviewed demographics, injury characteristics, management, and operative outcomes of severe CSI encountered in youth sports.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Children below 18 years with operative sports-related CSI at a Level 1 pediatric trauma center were reviewed (2004 to 2019). All patients underwent morden cervical spine instrumentation and fusion. Clinical, radiographic, and surgical characteristics were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3231 patients (mean, 11.3±4.6 y) with neck pain were evaluated for CSI. Sports/recreational activities were the most common etiology in 1358 cases (42.0%). Twenty-nine patients (2.1%) with sports-related CSI (mean age, 14.5 y; range, 6.4 to 17.8 y) required surgical intervention. Twenty-five were males (86%). Operative CSI occurred in football (n=8), wrestling (n=7), gymnastics (n=5), diving (n=4), trampoline (n=2), hockey (n=1), snowboarding (n=1), and biking (n=1). Mechanisms were 27 hyperflexion/axial loading (93%) and 2 hyperextension injuries (7%). Most were cervical fractures (79%) and subaxial injuries (79%). Seven patients (24%) sustained spinal cord injury (SCI) and 3 patients (10%) cord contusion or myelomalacia without neurological deficits. The risk of SCI increased with age (P=0.03). Postoperatively, 2 SCI patients (29%) improved 1 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grade and 1 (14%) improved 2 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale Grades. Increased complications developed in SCI than non-SCI cases (mean, 2.0 vs. 0.1 complications; P=0.02). Bony fusion occurred in 26/28 patients (93%) after a median of 7.2 months (interquartile range, 6 to 15 mo). Ten patients (34%) returned to their baseline sport and 9 (31%) to lower-level activities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence of sports-related CSI requiring surgery is low with differences in age/sex, sport, and injury patterns. Older males with hyperflexion/axial loading injuries in contact sports were at greatest risk of SCI, complications, and permanent disability. Prevention campaigns, education on proper tackling techniques, and neck strength training are required in sports at high risk of hyperflexion/axial loading injury.

Such an approach needs to take into account all the risks associated with transportation of the critically ill patient from the ICU to the chamber and back, changing of ventilator circuits and intravascular lines, using different medical devices in a hyperbaric environment, advanced invasive physiological monitoring as well as medical procedures (infusions, drainage, etc) during long or frequently repeated HBOT sessions. Any medical staff who take care of critically ill patients during HBOT should be certified and trained according to both emergency/intensive care and hyperbaric requirements. For any HBOT session, the number of staff needed for any HBOT session depends on both the type of chamber and the patient's status--stable, demanding or critically ill. For a critically ill patient, the standard procedure is a one-to-one patient-staff ratio inside the chamber; however, the final decision whether this is enough is taken after careful risk assessment based on the patient's condition, clinical indication for HBOT, experience of the personnel involved in that treatment and the available equipment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964039/,2022-11-28 02:45:07 AM
The Hyperbaric Protective Tube: A housing for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber,"Jacek Kot, Piotr Siondalski, Ewa Lenkiewicz, Jacek Kot, Piotr Siondalski, Ewa Lenkiewicz",2019 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      During a hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) session, every medical device that is used within the hyperbaric chamber is exposed to several hazards, including an increased ambient pressure and partial pressure of oxygen. In Europe, all medical devices marketed and/or sold for use in hyperbaric conditions must be tested by the manufacturer and marked 'CE' if approved. At the moment, no left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been formally approved and CE-marked for HBOT.
    


          Case:
        
      
      A 65-year-old male was referred to our Hyperbaric Centre for HBOT due to a persistent life-threating soft tissue infection of the non-removable wire connecting the external controller with the pump implanted into the left ventricle of the heart (Heartware LVAD). The aim of the intervention reported here was to safely conduct HBOT sessions with this non-CE marked medical device. After risk analysis, the decision was made to isolate the external part of the LVAD (controller and batteries) from the ambient conditions in the hyperbaric chamber by placing it in a pressure-resistant housing that was vented to the external atmosphere. The housing, a 'Hyperbaric Protective Tube' was built and tested, and the resulting operating procedures were practiced by personnel involved in the patient's care. Thirty uneventful HBOT standard sessions were conducted with subsequent clinical improvement of the soft tissue infection, resulting in an extended timeframe for awaiting heart transplantation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An isolation housing that vents into the dumping system of the hyperbaric chamber allows for the safe use of critical medical devices without prior testing for their compatibility with the hyperbaric environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177520/,2022-11-28 02:45:08 AM

      Little is known about the epidemiology of clavicle fractures in United States (US) high school athletes. Sports participation among high school students has increased steadily, placing increased numbers at risk of sports-related injury.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To describe the epidemiology of clavicle fractures among high school athletes, including injury rates by sex, sport, and type of play and trends in operative versus nonoperative treatment.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Descriptive epidemiology study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study data set included all athlete-exposure (AE) and clavicle fracture data collected from 2008-2009 through 2016-2017 from a large sample of US high schools as part of the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study for students participating in boys' football, boys'/girls' soccer, boys'/girls' basketball, boys'/girls' volleyball, boys' wrestling, boys' baseball, girls' softball, girls' field hockey, boys' ice hockey, boys'/girls' lacrosse, boys'/girls' swimming and diving, boys'/girls' track and field, girls' gymnastics, girls' cheerleading, boys'/girls' tennis, and boys'/girls' cross-country.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 567 clavicle fractures were reported during 31,520,765 AEs, an injury rate of 1.80 per 100,000 AEs. Injury rates varied by sport, with the highest rates in the boys' full-contact sports of ice hockey (5.27), lacrosse (5.26), football (4.98), and wrestling (2.21). Among girls' sports, the highest rates were in soccer (0.92), lacrosse (0.26), and basketball (0.25). In sex-comparable sports, injury rates were still significantly higher among boys (1.03) than girls (0.35) (rate ratio, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.97-4.30). Injury rates were significantly higher in competition (4.58) as compared with practice (0.87) (rate ratio, 5.27; 95% CI, 4.44-6.26). Most injuries were treated conservatively (82.7%) rather than operatively (17.3%). Time to return to sports varied, with a greater proportion of medical disqualifications among those treated operatively (40.0%) as compared with those treated conservatively (22.6%) (injury proportion ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.31-2.39).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although clavicle fracture rates are relatively low, they vary by sport, sex, and activity. Understanding such differences should drive more effective, targeted injury prevention efforts. Increased time loss from sports with surgical versus conservative treatment may have been influenced by factors including injury severity and its timing relative to the season's progress.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31384623/,2022-11-28 02:45:10 AM

In folk medicine, A. polystachya is used to treat digestive and respiratory tract disturbances, as a sedative and antidepressant agent, and as a tonic for the nerves. This study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant and anxiolytic effect from the hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of Aloysia polystachya (HELAp) in zebrafish. The extract was analyzed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS) and the main compound detected was acteoside. HELAp was administered orally (10 mg/kg) and through immersion (mg/L). The anxiolytic activity was evaluated through the scototaxis (light-dark) test using caffeine as an anxiogenic agent and buspirone as a positive control. The parameters assessed were: period spent in the white compartment (s), latency (s), alternations (n), erratic swims (n), period of freezing (s), thigmotaxis (s), and risk evaluation (n). The antidepressant effect was evaluated through the novel tank diving test using 1% ethanol, unpredictable chronic stress, and social isolation as depressors; fluoxetine was used as a positive control. The parameters assessed were: period spent at the top of the tank, latency, quadrants crossed, erratic swim, period of freezing, and distance of swam. The main chemical compound of HELAp was acteoside. The administration of the extract on zebrafish managed to revert the anxiogenic effect of caffeine without impairing their locomotion. Additionally, the treatment exerted antidepressant activity similarly to fluoxetine. Overall, the results suggest a significant anxiolytic and antidepressant activity to the extract, which is probably due to the presence of the major compound, acteoside.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31373315/,2022-11-28 02:45:11 AM
ECHM Consensus Conference and levels of evidence,"Susannah Sherlock, Susannah Sherlock",2017 Jun,"The ECHM Consensus Conference on indications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) was a welcome update of the evidence for HBOT use. However, clarification is requested in relation to how the GRADE system (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was modified and how levels of evidence were applied in the case of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). GRADE has a low kappa value for inter-observer agreement, so is modification valid? The original GRADE criteria, using consensus, grades evidence (defined as high, low and very low) and uses this to adjust the strength of recommendations. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) score highly. The ECHM have modified the GRADE system without explanation, assigning grades as levels 1 to 4 and have asserted that RCTs which are double-blinded constitute level 1 or 2 evidence. This has important implications for HBOT research. The term double-blinded is not used in the abstract, which leads the reader to wonder; where do RCTs which are not double-blinded fit in? The ECHM, by including the term double blinded as a requirement for level 1 or 2, has lifted the evidence bar. Does this constitute a form of research ""bracket creep""? Double-blinding is viewed by many to require a 'sham' treatment in hyperbaric research. Many conditions require multiple doses requiring daily hospital attendance with associated costs of lost time from work and daily transport costs. Even with a crossover after the sham, a requirement of many ethics committees, the lost time for a patient is a considerable burden. Delaying HBOT until crossover in those randomised to the control group in a disease that has a narrow therapeutic temporal window, such as idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL), may affect the chance of recovery. Double blinding is logistically difficult with HBOT. A sham treatment may be achieved by using air instead of oxygen; however, this exposes the non-intervention group to a risk that the intervention group does not have, that of decompression sickness (DCS). This may be considered to be unethical. Researchers have used hypoxic air mixtures to compensate for the higher oxygen partial pressure at depth as the control, but this is complex and increases the nitrogen load (and thus the risk of DCS). RCTs which control by other methods should still be considered high level evidence (as the original GRADE system recognised). Many indications for HBOT have multiple therapies against which to compare, which could act as a control. The requirement for double-blinding to achieve level 1 or 2 evidence may hamper research; an unintended negative consequence. There is lack of consistency of definitions in relation to levels of evidence used by the ECHM. The authors state that for clinical research the levels of evidence are; levels A to F, which they defined. The ECHM jury used a grading scale of level 1 to 4. For ISSHL, this results in a recommendation to treat based on level B evidence. Is this the same as level 2 in their modified system? This is confusing. The authors have not explained why they modified the GRADE system which is itself non-validated. The lack of references to the publications which provide the foundation for the strength of the recommendations leaves the reader unable to determine the true strength of the evidence. The GRADE system has been criticised as it dissociates recommendations from the evidence that the recommendation is founded upon. Further, the application of the GRADE system has been questioned when strong recommendations are made with it as this may cause ethics committees to question whether equipoise exists, further hampering research. How do we present a well-designed trial for ISSHL to an ethics committee when a strong recommendation has already been made despite the Cochrane review on ISSHL concluding there is a need for large, well designed RCTs in this area?",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28641328/,2022-11-28 02:45:12 AM
Work Conditions and Practices in Norwegian Fire Departments From 1950 Until Today: A Survey on Factors Potentially Influencing Carcinogen Exposure,"Jarle Jakobsen, Ronnie Babigumira, Marie Danielsen, Tom K Grimsrud, Raymond Olsen, Cecilie Rosting, Marit B Veierød, Kristina Kjærheim, Jarle Jakobsen, Ronnie Babigumira, Marie Danielsen, Tom K Grimsrud, Raymond Olsen, Cecilie Rosting, Marit B Veierød, Kristina Kjærheim",2020 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Meta-analyses have shown firefighters to be at an increased risk of several cancer types. Occupational carcinogen exposure may explain these increased risks. This study aims to describe Norwegian fire departments' work conditions from 1950 until today, focusing on factors relevant for potential occupational carcinogen exposure.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      With the help of a reference group, we developed a questionnaire on topics related to occupational exposure to carcinogens for the period 1950-2018. Selected Norwegian fire departments provided department-specific responses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixteen departments, providing fire services for 48% of the Norwegian population as of 2019 and mainly consisting of professional firefighters, responded to our questionnaire. The introduction of synthetic firefighting foams, more regular live fire training, the introduction of chemical diving, and a higher number of diesel-driven fire service vehicles were identified as changes thought to increase exposure to occupational carcinogens. Changes thought to decrease exposure included the switch from negative to positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatuses, the use of self-contained breathing apparatuses during all phases of firefighting, the use of ventilating fans during firefighting, increased attention to flammable materials used during live fire training, increased attention to handling and cleaning of turnout gear and other equipment, and installment of exhaust removal systems in apparatus bays.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Norwegian fire departments' work conditions have seen several changes since 1950, and this could influence firefighters' occupational carcinogen exposure. A peak of carcinogen exposure may have occurred in the 1970s and 1980s before recent changes have reduced exposure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33329918/,2022-11-28 02:45:13 AM
Why you should wear your seatbelt on an airplane: Burst fracture of the atlas (jefferson fracture) due to in-flight turbulence,"Nikola Lekic, Jonathan Sheu, Hayley Ennis, Nathan Lebwohl, Motasem Al-Maaieh, Nikola Lekic, Jonathan Sheu, Hayley Ennis, Nathan Lebwohl, Motasem Al-Maaieh",2019 Jun 15,"The Jefferson fracture is a burst-type fracture to the atlas first described in 1919, characterized by anterior and posterior fractures of the weak C1 ring caused by a sudden axial load to the vertex of the skull. Here we report a Jefferson fracture caused by head trauma due to mid-flight turbulence in an unrestrained 56-year-old male airline passenger. Imaging revealed a comminuted burst fracture of the atlas with an avulsion fracture of the transverse atlantal ligament. The patient was treated conservatively in a Miami-J collar with close clinical and radiographic follow-up. Lateral flexion-extension radiographs demonstrated fracture stability, and clinically the patient lacked pain or neurologic symptoms at 12 weeks from injury. To our knowledge this is the first report of a Jefferson fracture caused by axial compression attributable to in-flight turbulence. Traditionally associated with automobile crashes and diving headfirst into shallow pools, the axial load results in a compressive force to the atlas and subsequent lateral separation of the two halves of the C1 vertebral ring. The purpose of this case study is to alert providers, aircraft personnel, and passengers of the inherent risk of air travel and the importance of wearing a seatbelt at all times, describe the signs and symptoms of this often-overlooked fracture, and provide general treatment guidelines based on radiographic assessments of fracture stability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31879479/,2022-11-28 02:45:14 AM
Fear dynamically structures the ocean's pelagic zone,"Samuel S Urmy, Kelly J Benoit-Bird, Samuel S Urmy, Kelly J Benoit-Bird",2021 Nov 22,"Fear of predation can have wide-ranging ecological effects.1-4 This is especially true in the ocean's pelagic zone, the Earth's largest habitat, where vertical gradients in light and primary productivity force numerous taxa to migrate vertically each night to feed at the surface while minimizing risk from visual predators.5-7 Despite its importance and the fact that it is driven by spatial differences in perceived risk,8 diel vertical migration (DVM) is rarely considered within the ""landscape of fear""3,8,9 framework.10 It is also far from the only such process in the pelagic zone. We used continuous, year-long records from an upward-looking echosounder and broadband hydrophone at a cabled observatory off Central California, USA, to observe avoidance reactions by several groups of pelagic animals to the presence of their predators. As expected, vertical migration was ubiquitous, but we also observed behaviors at shorter and longer timescales that were best explained by fear of predation. The presence of foraging odontocetes induced immediate diving behavior in mesopelagic sound-scattering layers, and schools of epipelagic fishes induced similar reaction in layers of zooplankton and mesopelagic micronekton. At longer timescales, the presence of fish schools significantly deepened vertical migration, rearranging life throughout the water column. We argue that behavioral reactions to predation risk are common in the pelagic zone at a range of spatiotemporal scales and that our understanding of food webs and biogeochemical cycling in this immense biome will be incomplete unless we account for fear.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34562382/,2022-11-28 02:45:15 AM
Ethanol and Cannabinoids Regulate Zebrafish GABAergic Neuron Development and Behavior in a Sonic Hedgehog and Fibroblast Growth Factor-Dependent Mechanism,"Oswald Boa-Amponsem, Chengjin Zhang, Derek Burton, Kevin P Williams, Gregory J Cole, Oswald Boa-Amponsem, Chengjin Zhang, Derek Burton, Kevin P Williams, Gregory J Cole",2020 Jul,"Background:
        
      
      Ethanol (EtOH) has diverse effects on nervous system development, which includes development and survival of GABAergic neurons in a sonic hedgehog (Shh) and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-dependent mechanism. Cannabinoids also function as inhibitors of Shh signaling, raising the possibility that EtOH and cannabinoids may interact to broadly disrupt neuronal function during brain development.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of EtOH and/or cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) agonist concentrations at specific developmental stages, in the absence or presence of morpholino oligonucleotides that disrupt shh expression. In situ hybridization was employed to analyze glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad1) gene expression as a marker of GABAergic neuron differentiation, and zebrafish behavior was analyzed using the novel tank diving test as a measure of risk-taking behavior.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Combined acute subthreshold EtOH and CB1R agonist exposure results in a marked reduction in gad1 mRNA expression in zebrafish forebrain. Consistent with the EtOH and cannabinoid effects on Shh signaling, fgf8 mRNA overexpression rescues the EtOH- and cannabinoid-induced decrease in gad1 gene expression and also prevents the changes in behavior induced by EtOH and cannabinoids.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These studies provide evidence that forebrain GABAergic neuron development and zebrafish risk-taking behavior are sensitive to both EtOH and cannabinoid exposure in a Shh- and Fgf-dependent mechanism, and provide additional evidence that a signaling pathway involving Shh and Fgf crosstalk is a critical target of EtOH and cannabinoids in FASD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32472575/,2022-11-28 02:45:16 AM
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia,"Jamie McDonald, David A Stevenson, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Jamie McDonald, David A Stevenson, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that lack intervening capillaries and result in direct connections between arteries and veins. The most common clinical manifestation is spontaneous and recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) beginning on average at age 12 years. Telangiectases (small AVMs) are characteristically found on the lips, tongue, buccal and gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, face, and fingers. The appearance of telangiectases is generally later than epistaxis but may be during childhood. Large AVMs occur most often in the lungs, liver, or brain; complications from bleeding or shunting may be sudden and catastrophic. A minority of individuals with HHT have GI bleeding, which is rarely seen before age 50 years.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of HHT is established in a proband with three or more of the following clinical features:
    

EpistaxisMucocutaneous telangiectases in characteristic locationsVisceral AVMsA first-degree relative diagnosed with HHT on the basis of the preceding criteria


      
      Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Nosebleeds are treated with humidification, topical moisturizing therapy, hemostatic products, antifibrinolytic therapy, ablation therapy, systemic antiangiogenic agents, septodermoplasty, and nasal closure as needed. GI bleeding and anemia is treated with iron replacement therapy and (if needed) blood transfusions and antiangiogenic agents. Pulmonary AVMs with a feeding vessel 1-2 mm or greater in diameter typically require occlusion for stroke prevention. When pulmonary shunting is present, use antibiotic prophylaxis for dental and non-sterile invasive procedures, taking care to prevent air bubbles from being introduced in intravenous lines. This may include an air filter when available and compatible with the medication being administered. Treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension as per cardiologist, pulmonologist, and other relevant specialists. Symptomatic hepatic AVMs are managed medically; liver transplantation is recommended for individuals who do not respond to medical therapy and who develop high-output heart failure. Cerebral AVMs are treated as indicated by size, location, or symptoms: by surgery, embolotherapy, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. Gastrointestinal polyps are treated according to guidelines for juvenile polyposis syndrome.
    

Surveillance: Annual evaluation by a health care provider familiar with HHT for signs and symptoms of complications; annual hematocrit, hemoglobin, and ferritin; evaluation for pulmonary AVMs every five years with transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TCE) in adults, TCE or chest radiograph with pulse oximetry in children; brain MRI with and without contrast using sequences that detect blood products in infancy and again after puberty for cerebral AVMs; colonoscopy at age 15 years and repeated every three years if no polyps are found, or annually with esophagogastroduodenoscopy if colonic polyps are identified in those with SMAD4-HHT.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vigorous nose blowing; lifting heavy objects; straining during bowel movements; finger manipulation in the nose; anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agents (including aspirin) in individuals with significant nose or GI bleeding; scuba diving unless TCE within the last five years was negative for evidence of a right-to-left shunt; liver biopsy.
    

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing is offered to at-risk family members if the germline pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, at-risk family members should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of HHT, and screening should be offered to at-risk family members if the diagnosis cannot be ruled out.
    

Pregnancy management: Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary and cerebral AVMs; sizable pulmonary AVMs discovered during pregnancy are treated during the second trimester. Iron replacement is preferred for anemia, but transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary for symptomatic anemia despite aggressive iron replacement therapy.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      HHT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with considerable intrafamilial variability. Most individuals have an affected parent. Each child of a proband and the sibs of most probands are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing is possible for a pregnancy at increased risk if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301525/,2022-11-28 02:45:17 AM

      Decompression sickness (DCS) primarily manifests musculoskeletal pain, cutaneous manifestations, lymphatic symptoms, and neurological symptoms. DCS might affect the central nervous system and induce the stress in the patients, but few studies about the psychiatric morbidity after DCS have been conducted. This study aimed to investigate the association between DCS and the risk of developing psychiatric disorders.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      This study was a population-based, matched-cohort design.

After adjusting for the confounding factors, Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the risk of developing psychiatric disorders during the 10 years of follow-up period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the study subjects, 10 (8.13%) developed psychiatric disorders when compared to 35 (5.69%) in the control group. The study subjects were more likely to develop psychiatric disorders (crude hazard ratio [HR]: 2.79 (95% CI=1.37-5.69, P<0.01). After adjusting for sex, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region, and comorbidities, the adjusted HR was 3.83 (95% CI=1.60-9.16, P<0.01). Sleep disorders was associated with DCS with the adjusted HR as 5.74 (95% CI=1.04-31.56, P<0.01). Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy was not associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients who suffered from DCS have a 3.8-fold risk of developing psychiatric disorders, and a 5.7-fold risk of sleep disorders. This finding is a reminder for the clinicians that a regular psychiatric follow-up might well be needed for these patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31291221/,2022-11-28 02:45:19 AM
"Forgotten fatalities: British military, mining and maritime accidents since 1900","S E Roberts, T Carter, H D Smith, A John, J G Williams, S E Roberts, T Carter, H D Smith, A John, J G Williams",2021 Oct 1,"Background:
        
      
      Comparative long-term trends in fatal accident rates in the UK's most hazardous occupations have not been reported.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To compare trends in fatal accident rates in six of the most hazardous occupations (the three armed forces, merchant shipping, sea fishing and coal mining) and the general British workforce during peacetime years since 1900.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Examinations of annual mortality reports, returns, inquiry files and statistics. The main outcome measure was the fatal accident rate per 100 000 population employed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      These six occupations accounted for ~40% of all fatal accidents in the British workforce. Fatal accident rates were highest in merchant shipping to 1914 (400-600 per 100 000) and in the Royal Air Force and sea fishing by the early 1920s (around 300 per 100 000). Since the 1950s sea fishing has remained the most hazardous occupation (50-200). Widespread reductions in fatal accident rates for each occupation have been greatest in recent years in the three armed forces and merchant shipping. Compared with the general workforce, relative risks of fatalities have increased in recent decades in all these occupations except shipping.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      All six occupations still have high fatal accident rates. The greatly increased fatalities in sea fishing generally and in the Royal Air Force during its early years reflect, for different reasons, cultures of extreme risk-taking in these two sectors. Reductions in fatality rates in the armed forces over the last 20 years are due largely to decreases in land transport accidents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34415338/,2022-11-28 02:45:20 AM
"Fatty diet, active hydrophobic spots, and decompression sickness","Ran Arieli, Ran Arieli",2018 Sep 30,"In a study of the effect of a fatty diet on decompression bubbles, based on the responses to a questionnaire regarding daily food consumption, the approximate fat intake for each diver was calculated, taking into account the maximum recommended intake for a person doing his type of work. Following hyperbaric exposure, divers were divided into two groups: 'bubblers' (a minimum of the second level on the Kisman-Masurel scale) and 'non-bubblers'. Bubblers had higher fat consumption than non-bubblers (146 ± 39% versus 92 ± 18%). There was only a small difference in body mass index between the two groups: 26.3 ± 3.3 kg·m⁻² for bubblers and 24.9 ± 1.9 kg·m⁻² for non-bubblers. Cholesterol and triglycerides in serum were high in the bubblers (211 ± 39 mg·dl⁻¹ and 230 ± 129 mg∙dl⁻¹, respectively) compared with the non-bubblers (188 ± 34 mg∙dl⁻¹ and 153 ± 111 mg∙dl⁻¹, respectively). The authors concluded that a high-fat diet significantly increased the severity of decompression stress in hyperbaric air exposures. However, their explanation that the increased amount of fat in the serum contained more dissolved nitrogen, and that this was the cause of the increase in bubble production, was challenged in a subsequent letter. Decompression bubbles can expand and develop only from pre-existing gas micronuclei. It is known that nanobubbles form spontaneously when a smooth hydrophobic surface is submerged in water containing dissolved gas. We have shown that these nanobubbles are the gas micronuclei underlying decompression bubbles and decompression sickness. It has been suggested that hydrophobic multilayers of phospholipids on the luminal aspect of blood vessels, which we have termed active hydrophobic spots (AHS), were derived from lung surfactant. The essential components of lung surfactant required to construct the surfactant films, namely dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and surfactant proteins B and C, were found in the plasma of man and sheep, while DPPC was also found at the AHS. These findings have borne out the assumption that lung surfactants are the source of the AHS on the luminal aspect of blood vessels. These AHS seem to be stable, and their number and size increase with age as more DPPC settles. Bubbles may evolve at these AHS with decompression. The nanobubbles so formed on the surface of these lamellar layers of phospholipids in divers will expand into venous bubbles on decompression. The main surfactant in the lung is DPPC (40%), with the presence of additional components including other phospholipids, glycerides, and cholesterol. In the cited study, only serum triglycerides and cholesterol were measured, whereas it may well be that other phospholipids and fatty acids were carried by proteins in the plasma. We suggest that, as with the different elements which compose the layers of surfactant in the lung, some of the additional fatty components carried by the blood will attach themselves to the AHS, thus contributing further to their enlargement. We hypothesise that divers who consume food that is high in fat, and as a result have more fatty components in their blood, will develop more and larger AHS, subsequently becoming bubblers with a higher risk of decompression illness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30199893/,2022-11-28 02:45:21 AM
"Randomised, controlled, open label, multicentre clinical trial to explore safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for preventing ICU admission, morbidity and mortality in adult patients with COVID-19","Anders Kjellberg, Johan Douglas, Michael T Pawlik, Michael Kraus, Nicklas Oscarsson, Xiaowei Zheng, Peter Bergman, Oskar Frånberg, Jan H Kowalski, Sven Paul Nyren, Mårten Silvanius, Magnus Skold, Sergiu-Bogdan Catrina, Kenny A Rodriguez-Wallberg, Peter Lindholm, Anders Kjellberg, Johan Douglas, Michael T Pawlik, Michael Kraus, Nicklas Oscarsson, Xiaowei Zheng, Peter Bergman, Oskar Frånberg, Jan H Kowalski, Sven Paul Nyren, Mårten Silvanius, Magnus Skold, Sergiu-Bogdan Catrina, Kenny A Rodriguez-Wallberg, Peter Lindholm",2021 Jul 5,"Introduction:
        
      
      COVID-19 may cause severe pneumonitis and trigger a massive inflammatory response that requires ventilatory support. The intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality has been reported to be as high as 62%. Dexamethasone is the only of all anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested to date that has shown a positive effect on mortality. We aim to explore if treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe and effective for patients with severe COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that HBO can prevent ICU admission, morbidity and mortality by attenuating the inflammatory response. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBO reduces the number of ICU admissions compared with best practice treatment for COVID-19, main secondary objectives are to evaluate if HBO reduces the load on ICU resources, morbidity and mortality and to evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      A randomised, controlled, phase II, open label, multicentre trial. 200 subjects with severe COVID-19 and at least two risk factors for mortality will be included. Baseline clinical data and blood samples will be collected before randomisation and repeated daily for 7 days, at days 14 and 30. Subjects will be randomised with a computer-based system to HBO, maximum five times during the first 7 days plus best practice treatment or only best practice treatment. The primary endpoint, ICU admission, is defined by criteria for selection for ICU. We will evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 using molecular analyses. All parameters are recorded in an electronic case report form. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the safety parameters.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      The trial is approved by The National Institutional Review Board in Sweden (2020-01705) and the Swedish Medical Product Agency (5.1-2020-36673). Positive, negative and any inconclusive results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals with open access.

"The epidemiology of pre-hospital potential spinal cord injuries in Victoria, Australia: a six year retrospective cohort study","Ala'a O Oteir, Karen Smith, Johannes U Stoelwinder, Shelley Cox, James W Middleton, Paul A Jennings, Ala'a O Oteir, Karen Smith, Johannes U Stoelwinder, Shelley Cox, James W Middleton, Paul A Jennings",2016 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (TSCI) is relatively uncommon, yet a devastating and costly condition. Despite the human and social impacts, studies describing patients with potential TSCI in the pre-hospital setting are scarce. This paper aims to describe the epidemiology of patients potentially at risk of or suspected to have a TSCI by paramedics, with a view to providing a better understanding of factors associated with potential TSCI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients managed and transported by Ambulance Victoria (AV) between 01 January 2007 and 31 December 2012 who, based on meeting pre-hospital triage protocols and criteria for spinal clearance, paramedic suspicion or spinal immobilisation, were classified to be at risk of or suspected to have a TSCI. Data was extracted from the AV data warehouse, including demographic details, trauma aetiology, paramedic assessment, management and other event characteristics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 106,059cases were included in the study, representing 2.3 % of all emergency transports by AV. Subjects had a median age of 51 years (interquartile range; 29-78) and 52.4 % were males (95 % CI 52-52.7). Males were significantly younger than females (M: 43 years [26-65] vs. F: 64 years [36-84], p =0.001). Falls and traffic accidents were the leading causes of injuries, comprising 46.9 and 39.4 % of cases, respectively. Other causes included accidents due to sport, animals, industrial work and diving, as well as violence and hanging. 29.9 % of patients were transported to a Major Trauma Service (MTS). A proportion of 48.8 % of the study population met the Pre-hospital Major Trauma criteria.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the first study to describe the epidemiology of potential TSCI in Australia and is based on a large, state-wide sample. It provides background knowledge and a baseline for future research, as well as a reference point for future in policy. Falling and traffic related injuries were the leading causes of potential SCI. Future research is required to identify the proportion of confirmed TSCI among the potentials and factors associated with TSCI in prehospital settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27747560/,2022-11-28 02:45:24 AM

A 51-year-old male hyperbaric physician, also an experienced diver, was working as an inside attendant during a standard hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) session (70 minutes at 253.3 kPa [2.5 atmospheres absolute, 15 metres' seawater equivalent]) in a large walk-in MHC. Within 10 minutes after the end of the session, symptoms of spinal DCS occurred. Recompression started within 90 minutes with an infusion of lignocaine and hydration. All neurological symptoms resolved within 10 minutes breathing 100% oxygen at 283.6 kPa (2.8 atmospheres absolute) and a standard US Navy Treatment Table 6 was completed. He returned to regular hyperbaric work after four weeks of avoiding hyperbaric exposures. Transoesophageal echocardiography with a bubble study was performed 18 months after the event without any sign of a persistent (patent) foramen ovale. Any hyperbaric exposure, even within no-decompression limits, is an essential occupational risk for decompression sickness in internal hyperbaric attendants, especially considering the additional risk factors typical for medical personnel (age, dehydration, tiredness, non-optimal physical capabilities and frequent problems with the lower back).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761550/,2022-11-28 02:45:24 AM
A COVID-19 infection incidentally detected during hyperbaric oxygen treatment and preventive measures for COVID-19 transmission in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber,"Abdurrahman E Demir, Savas Ilbasmis, Akin S Toklu, Abdurrahman E Demir, Savas Ilbasmis, Akin S Toklu",2022 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 and has become a serious threat to public health. As it can easily be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, there is an increased risk of transmission in enclosed environments such as hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) units if preventive measures are not taken.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      A 16-year-old female tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during HBOT for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The other patients and the inside attendant who attended the sessions with her were regarded as contacts, tested for SARS-CoV-2, and quarantined until the test results were available. Ultimately, none of them tested positive.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      As HBOT in multiplace chambers entails a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we strictly adapted our practice to consider that every patient could be a potential asymptomatic carrier. Therefore, the negative results of all contacts in this case and the fact that no confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported suggests that these measures successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 transmission in our HBOT clinic. SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be prevented if sufficient protective measures are taken.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313375/,2022-11-28 02:45:25 AM
A pro/con review comparing the use of mono- and multiplace hyperbaric chambers for critical care,"Folke Lind, Folke Lind",2015 Mar,"Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) of critically ill patients requires special technology and appropriately trained medical team staffing for '24/7' emergency services. Regardless of the chamber system used it is essential that the attending nurse and critical care specialist understand the physics and physiology of hyperbaric oxygen for safe treatment and compression/decompression procedures. Mechanical ventilation through endotracheal tube or tracheotomy is hampered by the increased gas density and flow resistance with risks of hypoventilation, carbon dioxide retention and oxygen seizures. Ventilation should be controlled and arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels monitored. Haemodynamically unstable patients require careful risk-benefit evaluation, invasive monitoring and close supervision of inotropes, vasopressors and sedative drug infusions to avoid blood pressure swings and risk of awareness. Two distinctly different chambers are used for critical care. Small cost-efficient and easy-to-install acrylic monoplace chambers require less staffing and no inside attendant. Major disadvantages include patient isolation with difficulties to maintain standard organ support and invasive monitoring. Monoplace ventilators are less advanced and require the use of muscle relaxants and excessive sedation. Intravenous lines must be changed to specially designed IV pumps located outside the chamber with chamber pass-through and risk of inaccurate drug delivery. The multiplace chamber is better suited for HBOT of critically ill patients with failing vital functions and organ systems, primarily because it permits appropriate ICU equipment to be used inside the chamber by accompanying staff. Normal 'hands-on' intensive care continues during HBOT with close attention to all aspects of critical patient care. A regional trauma hospital-based rectangular chamber system immediately bordering critical care and emergency ward facilities is the best solution for safe HBOT in the critically ill. Disadvantages include long-term commitment, larger space requirements and higher capitalization, technical and staffing costs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964041/,2022-11-28 02:45:26 AM
Electrodermal Activity Is Sensitive to Cognitive Stress under Water,"Hugo F Posada-Quintero, John P Florian, Alvaro D Orjuela-Cañón, Ki H Chon, Hugo F Posada-Quintero, John P Florian, Alvaro D Orjuela-Cañón, Ki H Chon",2018 Jan 17,"When divers are at depth in water, the high pressure and low temperature alone can cause severe stress, challenging the human physiological control systems. The addition of cognitive stress, for example during a military mission, exacerbates the challenge. In these conditions, humans are more susceptible to autonomic imbalance. Reliable tools for the assessment of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) could be used as indicators of the relative degree of stress a diver is experiencing, which could reveal heightened risk during a mission. Electrodermal activity (EDA), a measure of the changes in conductance at the skin surface due to sweat production, is considered a promising alternative for the non-invasive assessment of sympathetic control of the ANS. EDA is sensitive to stress of many kinds. Therefore, as a first step, we tested the sensitivity of EDA, in the time and frequency domains, specifically to cognitive stress during water immersion of the subject (albeit with their measurement finger dry for safety). The data from 14 volunteer subjects were used from the experiment. After a 4-min adjustment and baseline period after being immersed in water, subjects underwent the Stroop task, which is known to induce cognitive stress. The time-domain indices of EDA, skin conductance level (SCL) and non-specific skin conductance responses (NS.SCRs), did not change during cognitive stress, compared to baseline measurements. Frequency-domain indices of EDA, EDASymp (based on power spectral analysis) and TVSymp (based on time-frequency analysis), did significantly change during cognitive stress. This leads to the conclusion that EDA, assessed by spectral analysis, is sensitive to cognitive stress in water-immersed subjects, and can potentially be used to detect cognitive stress in divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29387015/,2022-11-28 02:45:26 AM
An integrative review of skin assessment tools used to evaluate skin injury related to external beam radiation therapy,"Carol R Baines, William McGuiness, Geraldine A O'Rourke, Carol R Baines, William McGuiness, Geraldine A O'Rourke",2017 Apr,"Aims and objectives:
        
      
      To review literature associated with external beam radiotherapy and skin damage. A focus of the literature search is to highlight and discuss the myriad of skin assessment tools that are available to the clinician when assessing skin injury in patients receiving external beam radiation therapy.
    


          Background:
        
      
      It is apparent that despite considerable work being progressed in the development of individualised skin assessment tools, uptake and use is poor. These tools are designed to assist the clinician in the evaluation of damaged skin and predict the radiation wound development pathway.
    


          Design:
        
      
      An integrated review can be used to address a mature or new and emerging topic through a systematic methodology, which is either theoretical or empirical, gained from research, practice or policy initiatives (Whittemore & Knafl, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 52, 2005, 546). This review is particularly concerned with the employment of skin assessment tools by clinicians in patients with radiation damaged skin. Using the search terms synonyms for radiation, skin and epidermal damage, PubMed/MEDLINE, Medical Complete and Web of Science databases were searched. Consulting professional peers was employed as part of the inclusion and exclusion process.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is a high level of unpredictability about which patient will have an uncomplicated course of external beam radiotherapy. Variables may include, but are not limited to, an acute reaction, a delayed reaction resulting in actual skin damage or no visible skin disturbance. The skin assessment tools that are readily available are not regularly referenced in clinical practice when attempting to manage the many side effects of radiation therapy. Skin assessment tools require ongoing clinical validation, so they can be used to guide practitioners to undertake further assessment of skin integrity.
    


          Relevance to clinical practice:
        
      
      The current body of knowledge suggests clinicians caring for patients receiving therapeutic radiotherapy should consider integrating a recognised patient assessment skin framework into their daily routine. Such validated tools may add value to postradiotherapy patient care by providing a consistency of management and accordingly refining best practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27322721/,2022-11-28 02:45:27 AM
Association of Ultra-Widefield Fluorescein Angiography-Identified Retinal Nonperfusion and the Risk of Diabetic Retinopathy Worsening Over Time,"Paolo S Silva, Dennis M Marcus, Danni Liu, Lloyd Paul Aiello, Andrew Antoszyk, Michael Elman, Scott Friedman, Adam R Glassman, Joseph M Googe, Lee Merrill Jampol, Daniel F Martin, Michele Melia, Carin M Preston, Charles C Wykoff, Jennifer K Sun, DRCR Retina Network",2022 Oct 1,"Importance:
        
      
      Presence of predominantly peripheral diabetic retinopathy (DR) lesions on ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) was associated with greater risk of DR worsening or treatment over 4 years. Whether baseline retinal nonperfusion assessment is additionally predictive of DR disease worsening is unclear.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess whether the extent and location of retinal nonperfusion identified on UWF-FA are associated with worsening in Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) score or DR treatment over time.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This cohort study was a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal observational study with data for 508 eyes with nonproliferative DR and gradable nonperfusion on UWF-FA at baseline. All images were graded at a centralized reading center; 200° ultra-widefield (UWF) color images were graded for DR at baseline and annually for 4 years. Baseline 200° UWF-FA images were graded for nonperfused area, nonperfusion index (NPI), and presence of predominantly peripheral lesions on UWF-FA (FA PPL).
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Treatment of DR or diabetic macular edema was at investigator discretion.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Association of baseline UWF-FA nonperfusion extent with disease worsening, defined as either 2 or more steps of DRSS worsening within Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study fields on UWF-color images or receipt of DR treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After adjusting for baseline DRSS, the risk of disease worsening over 4 years was higher in eyes with greater overall NPI (hazard ratio [HR] for 0.1-unit increase, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21; P = .02) and NPI within the posterior pole (HR for 0.1-unit increase, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17-1.56; P < .001) and midperiphery (HR for 0.1-unit increase, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.16; P = .04). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for baseline DRSS score and baseline systemic risk factors, greater NPI (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.22; P = .02) and presence of FA PPL (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.35-2.65; P < .001) remained associated with disease worsening.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      This 4-year longitudinal study has demonstrated that both greater baseline retinal nonperfusion and FA PPL on UWF-FA are associated with higher risk of disease worsening, even after adjusting for baseline DRSS score and known systemic risk. These associations between disease worsening and retinal nonperfusion and FA PPL support the increased use of UWF-FA to complement color fundus photography in future efforts for DR prognosis, clinical care, and research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35980610/,2022-11-28 02:45:28 AM
Hemorrhage within the tympanic membrane without perforation,"Chang-Hee Kim, Jung Eun Shin, Chang-Hee Kim, Jung Eun Shin",2018 Nov 6,"Background:
        
      
      Hemotympanum refers to both the presence of blood in the middle ear cavity and to ecchymosis of the tympanic membrane (TM), and a systematic study of intra-TM (iTM) hemorrhage without bleeding in the middle ear cavity has not been conducted. The goals of our study were to analyze the causes of iTM hemorrhage without TM perforation or bleeding in the middle ear cavity, and to demonstrate the clinical characteristics of the disease.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This Case series study included five patients with iTM hemorrhage between August 2014 and August 2017. An iTM hemorrhage was diagnosed when otoendoscopic examination demonstrated minor bleeding behind the intact TM, a hemorrhage was observed between the TM annulus and the epidermal layer, and temporal bone computed tomography revealed thickening of the TM without soft tissue density within the tympanic cavity or temporal bone fracture. Initial symptoms, and serial findings of otoendoscopy and pure tone audiometry (PTA) were investigated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      iTM hemorrhage developed due to blunt head trauma in two patients, descent barotrauma during scuba diving in two patients, and spontaneous epistaxis in one patient. Otalgia and ear fullness were the most common symptoms, but PTA showed no or minimal conductive hearing loss in all patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      An iTM hemorrhage may develop after blunt head trauma, barotrauma due to scuba diving, or spontaneous epistaxis; otological symptoms included otalgia, tinnitus, and aural fullness.

Recurrent cutaneous decompression illness after PFO device implantation: a case report,"Martin Vanden EEde, Martin Vanden EEde",2016 Nov-Dec,"It is well known that patency of the foramen ovale (PFO) is a risk factor for decompression illness (DCI) in scuba divers, even if they adhere to the currently accepted and used decompression tables (termed ""an undeserved hit""). The correction of the PFO through percutaneous closure after DCI is an ongoing discussion. We describe a case of a diver who redeveloped a cutaneous DCI due to a recurrent PFO after initial treatment with an occluder device four years earlier.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28777522/,2022-11-28 02:45:30 AM
Inner-ear decompression sickness: 'hubble-bubble' without brain trouble?,"Lucio Tremolizzo, Massimo Malpieri, Carlo Ferrarese, Ildebrando Appollonio, Lucio Tremolizzo, Massimo Malpieri, Carlo Ferrarese, Ildebrando Appollonio",2015 Jun,"Inner-ear decompression sickness (DCS) is an incompletely understood and increasingly recognized condition in compressed-air divers. Previous reports show a high association of inner-ear DCS with persistent foramen ovale (PFO), suggesting that a moderate-to-severe right-to-left shunt might represent a major predisposing factor, and more properly deﬁning it as an event from arterial gas embolism (AGE). However, other conditions characterized by bubbles entering the arterial circulation, such as open-chamber cardiac surgery, do not produce inner-ear involvement, while sometimes damaging the brain extensively. Moreover, in other sites, such as the spinal cord, the prevailing mechanism for DCS is not AGE, but more likely local bubble formation with subsequent compression of venules and capillaries. Thus, AGE might be, more properly, a predisposing condition, neither sufﬁcient, nor possibly even strictly necessary for inner-ear DCS. A 'two-hit hypothesis' has been proposed, implying a locally selective vulnerability of the inner ear to AGE. Modelled kinetics for gas removal are slower in the inner ear compared to the brain, leading to a supersaturated environment which allows bubbles to grow until they eventually obstruct the labyrinthine artery. Since this artery is relatively small, there is a low probability for a bubble to enter it; this might explain the disproportion between the high prevalence of PFO in the general population (25-30%) and the very low incidence of inner-ear DCS in compressed-air diving (approximately 0.005%). Furthermore, given that the labyrinthine artery usually originates either from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, or directly from the basilar artery, shunting bubbles will more frequently swarm through the entire brain. In this case, however, the brain's much faster gas removal kinetics might allow for them to be reabsorbed without damaging brain tissue. In line with this scenario is the low probability (approx. 15%) of inner-ear DCS presenting with concomitant symptoms suggestive of brain involvement. Interestingly, PFO is a putative risk factor not only for DCS but also for ischaemic stroke, and it has been hypothesized that a predominantly silent ischaemic cerebral burden might represent a meaningful surrogate of end-organ damage in divers with PFO, with implications for stroke or cognitive decline. Here we report the case of a 44-year-old diving instructor (> 350 dives) who suffered from inner-ear DCS about 10 min after a routine dive (5 min/40 metres' fresh water (mfw), ascent 7.5 mfw·min⁻¹, stop 10 min/5 mfw), resulting in severe left cochlear/vestibular impairment (complete deafness and marked vertigo, only the latter slowly receding after a few hours). The patient was not recompressed. A few months later, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated a moderate-to-severe shunt (> 30 bubbles), presumably due to a PFO (he refused confirmatory echocardiography), while a brain MRI (1.5 T) was reported as negative for both recent and remote lacunar infarcts (Figure 1). We believe this may be evidence that inner-ear DCS could occur while the brain is completely spared, not only clinically, but also at neuroimaging. This would support either of two hypotheses: (a) that the brain is indeed relatively protected from arterial bubbles that preferentially harm the inner ear where, however, they only rarely inﬁltrate, or (b) that direct bubble formation within the inner ear cannot be completely discarded, and that the elevated PFO-inner-ear DCS association might be, in this latter case, merely circumstantial. We favour the hypothesis that inner-ear DCS might be related to AGE in an anatomically vulnerable region. More precise data regarding the exact incidence of inner-ear involvement, isolating those subjects with moderate-to-severe shunt, should be obtained before exploring the risk-to-beneﬁt ratio given by transcatheter occlusion of a PFO for prevention of inner-ear DCS; odds that could end up to be sensibly different with respect to other types of DCS presentation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165540/,2022-11-28 02:45:31 AM
Interacting Factors Associated with Adult Male Drowning in New Zealand,"James L Croft, Chris Button, James L Croft, Chris Button",2015 Jun 17,"Objectives:
        
      
      i) to identify factors that contribute to the global trend of the higher incidence of male drowning relative to females, and; ii) to explore relationships between such factors from mortality data in New Zealand.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Drownings from 1983 to 2012 were examined for: Age, Ethnicity, Site, Activity, Buoyancy and Alcohol. Conditional frequency tables presented as mosaic plots were used to assess the interactions of these factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Alcohol was involved in a high proportion of Accidental Immersion drownings (61%) and was highest for males aged 20-24 years. When alcohol was involved there were proportionally more incidences where a life jacket was Available But Not Worn and less incidences where a life jacket was Worn. Many 30-39 year old males drowned during underwater activities (e.g., snorkeling, diving). Older men (aged +55 years old) had a high incidence of drowning while boating. Different ethnicities were over-represented in different age groups (Asian men aged 25-29, and European men aged 65-74) and when involved in different activities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Numerous interacting factors are responsible for male drownings. In New Zealand, drowning locations and activities differ by age and ethnicity which require targeted intervention strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26083689/,2022-11-28 02:45:32 AM
Lower extremity overuse bone injury risk factors in collegiate athletes: a pilot study,"Mark F Reinking, Tricia M Austin, Jason Bennett, Ann M Hayes, William A Mitchell, Mark F Reinking, Tricia M Austin, Jason Bennett, Ann M Hayes, William A Mitchell",2015 Apr,"Background and purpose:
        
      
      There is limited evidence regarding risk factors for lower extremity overuse bone injury (LEOBI) in collegiate athletes. The purposes of the study were to: 1) determine incidence of LEOBI in selected sports and its impact on athletic participation and ADL, 2) assess risk relationships between LEOBI and selected risk factors, and 3) establish the viability of using calcaneal densitometry as a screening tool to identify risk for LEOBI.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Prospective analytical cohort design.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Collegiate athletes in selected sports (swimming/diving, women's soccer, field hockey, cross-country/track) at one university were invited to participate. Consenting athletes completed an initial questionnaire including demographic information, history, and menstrual function. Measurements included height/weight, hip abductor strength, foot posture index, and calcaneal bone mineral density. Athletes were monitored for potential LEOBI for nine months and an algorithm was used to determine if physician referral was required. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of physician-diagnosed LEOBI. If LEOBI was diagnosed by the physician, the athlete completed a follow-up visit including a repeat bone mineral density scan. All athletes were invited for a repeat scan at the end of the year and completed a final questionnaire. Athlete demographics were summarized using descriptive statistics and differences in continuous risk factors were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA. Finally, risk relationships for categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square and relative risk.
    


          Results:
        
      
      84 athletes (64 female, 20 male) consented to participate. Over the study period, eight athletes (one male, seven females) were diagnosed with LEOBI (LEOBI group), five with stress fractures and three with medial tibial stress syndrome. The other 76 athletes who did not have a diagnosis of LEOBI were placed in the non-LEOBI group. Five of the eight were cross-country/track athletes; no swimming/diving athletes had bone injury. Sport (cross-country/track) had a significant relative risk value of 2.26 (95% CI = 1.18-4.32) for LEOBI. There was no association between LEOBI occurrence and sex, hip abductor strength, body mass index, foot type, and menstrual function. There was no difference in bone mineral density at initial or follow-up measures between LEOBI and non-LEOBI groups (p>.05) when analyzing all athletes. When analyzing ground-based athletes only at follow-up (n=44), athletes with LEOBI had lower bone mineral density of right (p = .05) and left (p =.07) calcaneus. The relative risk for developing LEOBI based on calcaneal bone mineral density below the mean of the study participants was 2.1 (95%CI = 1.09-3.35) on the left and 1.53 (95% CI=.80- 3.06) on the right.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The incidence of LEOBI in this population of athletes was approximately 10%. Risk factors were sport (cross-country/track) and decreased left calcaneal bone mineral density. This study supports the use of calcaneal bone mineral density as a screening measurement for LEOBI risk and suggests the need for further investigation into additional LEOBI risk factors.

Epilepsy and physical exercise,"José Pimentel, Raquel Tojal, Joana Morgado, José Pimentel, Raquel Tojal, Joana Morgado",2015 Feb,"Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurologic diseases and has always been associated with stigma. In the interest of safety, the activities of persons with epilepsy (PWE) are often restricted. In keeping with this, physical exercise has often been discouraged. The precise nature of a person's seizures (or whether seizures were provoked or unprovoked) may not have been considered. Although there has been a change in attitude over the last few decades, the exact role of exercise in inducing seizures or aggravating epilepsy still remains a matter of discussion among experts in the field. Based mainly on retrospective, but also on prospective, population and animal-based research, the hypothesis that physical exercise is prejudicial has been slowly replaced by the realization that physical exercise might actually be beneficial for PWE. The benefits are related to improvement of physical and mental health parameters and social integration and reduction in markers of stress, epileptiform activity and the number of seizures. Nowadays, the general consensus is that there should be no restrictions to the practice of physical exercise in people with controlled epilepsy, except for scuba diving, skydiving and other sports at heights. Whilst broader restrictions apply for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, individual risk assessments taking into account the seizure types, frequency, patterns or triggers may allow PWE to enjoy a wide range of physical activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458104/,2022-11-28 02:45:33 AM
Patent foramen ovale: indications for closure and techniques,"Maurizio Taramasso, Fabian Nietlispach, Francesco Maisano, Bernhard Meier, Maurizio Taramasso, Fabian Nietlispach, Francesco Maisano, Bernhard Meier",2016 May 17,"Non-surgical closure of the patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been possible for 40 years and proved safe in probably a million cases performed worldwide. Nonetheless, indications are still restricted as only a few are supported by randomised data. Paradoxical embolism through a PFO causes stroke, myocardial infarction, and visceral or peripheral ischaemia. The PFO is a likely mediator of migraine, diving or high altitude sickness, dyspnoea, and sleep apnoea problems. As untoward effects of a PFO are rare and spaced widely timewise, large cohorts and long follow-ups are required to prove unequivocally that PFO closure is bene-ficial and appropriate in comparison to no treatment or medical therapy. The most compelling respective randomised data have been gathered so far in the realm of secondary prevention of cerebral attacks and migraine. Invariably they showed a numerical advantage of PFO closure with significant difference in sub-analyses. Evidence-based medicine carries a danger of underutilising valuable therapies while accumulating further data. PFO closure is an example. Its documented innocuousness invites a more proactive reflection in upcoming guidelines. At worst, PFO closure may not convey the projected amount of benefit. This even opens the door for primary prevention in some PFOs with high-risk characteristics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27174117/,2022-11-28 02:45:34 AM
Assessment of bleeding risk of interventional techniques: a best evidence synthesis of practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy,"Laxmaiah Manchikanti, Frank J E Falco, Ramsin M Benyamin, David L Caraway, Alan D Kaye, Standiford Helm 2nd, Bradley W Wargo, Hans Hansen, Allan T Parr, Vijay Singh, John R Swicegood, Howard S Smith, David M Schultz, Yogesh Malla, Joshua A Hirsch, Laxmaiah Manchikanti, Frank J E Falco, Ramsin M Benyamin, David L Caraway, Alan D Kaye, Standiford Helm 2nd, Bradley W Wargo, Hans Hansen, Allan T Parr, Vijay Singh, John R Swicegood, Howard S Smith, David M Schultz, Yogesh Malla, Joshua A Hirsch",2013 Apr,"Background:
        
      
      Interventional pain management is a specialty that utilizes invasive procedures to diagnose and treat chronic pain. Patients undergoing these treatments may be receiving exogenous anticoagulants and antithrombotics. Even though the risk of major bleeding is very small, the consequences can be catastrophic. However, the role of antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease to decrease the incidence of acute cerebral and cardiovascular events is also crucial. Overall, there is a paucity of literature on the subject of bleeding risk in interventional pain management along with practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and anti-thrombotic therapy.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Best evidence synthesis.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To critically appraise and synthesize the literature with assessment of the bleeding risk of interventional techniques including practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The available literature on the bleeding risk of interventional techniques and practice patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy was reviewed. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 through December 2012 and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There is good evidence for the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients who discontinue antithrombotic therapy, spontaneous epidural hematomas occur with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy associated with stressors such as chiropractic manipulation, diving, and anatomic abnormalities such as ankylosing spondylitis, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques. There is fair evidence that excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation may occur with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of thromboembolic phenomenon is higher than the risk of epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques, to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal], and Aggrenox [aspirin and dipyridamole]), and that anatomic conditions such as spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis, and procedures involving the cervical spine; multiple attempts; and large bore needles increase the risk of epidural hematoma; and rapid assessment and surgical or nonsurgical intervention to manage patients with epidural hematoma can avoid permanent neurological complications. There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), or prasugrel (Effient) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities. There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas during interventional techniques and to continue to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events.
    


          Recommendations:
        
      
      The recommendations derived from the comprehensive assessment of the literature and guidelines are to continue NSAIDs and low dose aspirin, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole, cilostazol, Aggrenox) during interventional techniques. However, the recommendations for discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) is variable with clinical judgment to continue or discontinue based on the patient's condition, the planned procedure, risk factors, and desires, and the cardiologist's opinion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin may be discontinued 12 hours prior to performing interventional techniques. Warfarin should be discontinued or international normalized ratio (INR) be normalized to 1.4 or less for high risk procedures and 2 or less for low risk procedures based on risk factors. It is also recommended to discontinue Pradaxa for 24 hours for paravertebral interventional techniques in 2 to 4 days for epidural interventions in patients with normal renal function and for longer periods of time in patients with renal impairment, and to discontinue rivaroxaban for 24 hours prior to performing interventional techniques.

"The Epidemiology of Stress Fractures in Collegiate Student-Athletes, 2004-2005 Through 2013-2014 Academic Years","Katherine H Rizzone, Kathryn E Ackerman, Karen G Roos, Thomas P Dompier, Zachary Y Kerr, Katherine H Rizzone, Kathryn E Ackerman, Karen G Roos, Thomas P Dompier, Zachary Y Kerr",2017 Oct,"Context:
        
      
       Stress fractures are injuries caused by cumulative, repetitive stress that leads to abnormal bone remodeling. Specific populations, including female athletes and endurance athletes, are at higher risk than the general athletic population. Whereas more than 460 000 individuals participate in collegiate athletics in the United States, no large study has been conducted to determine the incidence of stress fractures in collegiate athletes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
       To assess the incidence of stress fractures in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes and investigate rates and patterns overall and by sport.
    


          Design:
        
      
       Descriptive epidemiology study.
    


          Setting:

          Patients or other participants:
        
      
       National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes.
    


          Main outcome measure(s):
        
      
       Data were analyzed from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program for the academic years 2004-2005 through 2013-2014. We calculated rates and rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
    


          Results:
        
      
       A total of 671 stress fractures were reported over 11 778 145 athlete-exposures (AEs) for an overall injury rate of 5.70 per 100 000 AEs. The sports with the highest rates of stress fractures were women's cross-country ( 28.59/100 000 AEs), women's gymnastics ( 25.58/100 000 AEs), and women's outdoor track ( 22.26/100 000 AEs). Among sex-comparable sports (baseball/softball, basketball, cross-country, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, indoor track, and outdoor track), stress fracture rates were higher in women (9.13/100 000 AEs) than in men (4.44/100 000 AEs; RR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.71, 2.47). Overall, stress fracture rates for these NCAA athletes were higher in the preseason (7.30/100 000 AEs) than in the regular season (5.12/100 000 AEs; RR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.22, 1.67). The metatarsals (n = 254, 37.9%), tibia (n = 147, 21.9%), and lower back/lumbar spine/pelvis (n = 81, 12.1%) were the most common locations of injury. Overall, 21.5% (n = 144) of stress fractures were recurrent injuries, and 20.7% (n = 139) were season-ending injuries.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
       Women experienced stress fractures at higher rates than men, more often in the preseason, and predominantly in the foot and lower leg.

A prospective analysis of independent patient risk factors for middle ear barotrauma in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber,"Katherine H Commons, Denise F Blake, Lawrence H Brown, Katherine H Commons, Denise F Blake, Lawrence H Brown",2013 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      Middle ear barotrauma (MEBT) is the most common complication of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). We wished to determine whether independent risk factors could predict which patients will require tympanostomy tubes in order to continue HBOT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data regarding demographics, medical history and physical examination were collected prospectively over one year. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and six patients were included. The cumulative risk of MEBT over the first five treatments was 35.8% and that for needing tympanostomy tubes was 10.3%, while that for needing tubes at any time was 13.2%. Risk factors for MEBT on bivariate analysis were older age, history of ENT radiation and anticoagulant use. Risk factors for requiring tympanostomy tubes included a history of cardiovascular disease and patients being treated for an infective condition. The adjusted multivariate logistic model identified history of difficulty equalising as the only characteristic significantly associated with MEBT during the first five treatments, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95%CI): 11.0 (1.1 - 111.7). Being female, AOR (95%CI): 24.7 (1.8 - 339.7), and having a history of cardiovascular disease, AOR (95%CI): 20.7 (2.0 - 215.3), were significantly associated with the need for tympanostomy tubes during the first five HBOT, but there was no significant association between any other characteristics and the need for tubes at any point.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite some significant risk factors for MEBT being identified, we were unable to predict accurately enough which patients needed tympanostomy tubes during their HBOT to recommend these being placed prophylactically in selected patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24122189/,2022-11-28 02:45:36 AM

      Ventilator-dependent spinal cord-injured (SCI) patients require significant resources related to ventilator dependence. Diaphragm pacing (DP) has been shown to successfully replace mechanical ventilators for chronic ventilator-dependent tetraplegics. Early use of DP following SCI has not been described. Here, we report our multicenter review experience with the use of DP in the initial hospitalization after SCI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Under institutional review board approval for humanitarian use device, we retrospectively reviewed our multicenter nonrandomized interventional protocol of laparoscopic diaphragm motor point mapping with electrode implantation and subsequent diaphragm conditioning and ventilator weaning.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-nine patients with an average age of 31 years (range, 17-65 years) with only two females were identified. Mechanism of injury included motor vehicle collision (7), diving (6), gunshot wounds (4), falls (4), athletic injuries (3), bicycle collision (2), heavy object falling on spine (2), and motorcycle collision (1). Elapsed time from injury to surgery was 40 days (range, 3-112 days). Seven (24%) of the 29 patients who were evaluated for the DP placement had nonstimulatable diaphragms from either phrenic nerve damage or infarction of the involved phrenic motor neurons and were not implanted. Of the stimulatable patients undergoing DP, 72% (16 of 22) were completely free of ventilator support in an average of 10.2 days. For the remaining six DP patients, two had delayed weans of 180 days, three had partial weans using DP at times during the day, and one patient successfully implanted went to a long-term acute care hospital and subsequently had life-prolonging measures withdrawn. Eight patients (36%) had complete recovery of respiration, and DP wires were removed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Early laparoscopic diaphragm mapping and DP implantation can successfully wean traumatic cervical SCI patients from ventilator support. Early laparoscopic mapping is also diagnostic in that a nonstimulatable diaphragm is a convincing evidence of an inability to wean from ventilator support, and long-term ventilator management can be immediately instituted.

The hearing measured from the pre- and post-HBOT pure-tone audiogram (PTA4) at four frequencies; 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz and 4 kHz, was averaged and compared. The PTA4 score was classified into three groups: complete improvement (≤ 25 dB residual hearing loss); moderate improvement (11-50 dB gain) and no improvement (≤ 11dB gain). Data were also analysed using mean residual loss on completion as the outcome measure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-six patients underwent 1,029 HBOT sessions. Twenty five of 78 ears (33%) had complete resolution of deafness after HBOT. A further 31 (40%) had a significant improvement in PTA4. Delay (〉 28 days) and older age were associated with worse outcomes in PTA4 improvement. Those with less severe hearing loss and short delay (〈 15 days) had the best outcome (mean residual loss 28 dB). Eight of nine patients who were delayed 〉 28 days had no improvement in PTA4.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Fifty-six of 76 (74%) patients had complete (25) or moderate (31) improvement in hearing loss after HBOT. Short delay to HBOT, a severer degree of hearing loss and younger age were the best predictive factors of improved PTA4. Outcome was poor if treatment was delayed over 28 days. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to clarify the role of HBOT and steroids.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723017/,2022-11-28 02:45:38 AM
Retrospective analysis of influencing factors on the efficacy of mechanical ventilation in severe and critical COVID-19 patients,"Jia Zeng, Xiao-Xia Qi, Wan-Wan Cai, Ya-Ping Pan, Yi Xie, Jia Zeng, Xiao-Xia Qi, Wan-Wan Cai, Ya-Ping Pan, Yi Xie",2021 Nov 6,"Background:
        
      
      The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely around the world with strong infectivity, rapid mutation and a high mortality rate. Mechanical ventilation has been included in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 8) as an important treatment for severe and critical COVID-19 patients, but its clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients is various. Therefore, it is necessary to study the influencing factors on the efficacy of mechanical ventilation in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to determine the influencing factors on the efficacy of mechanical ventilation in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 27 severe and critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study and treated with mechanical ventilation at the Optical Valley Campus of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital (Wuhan, Hubei Province) from February 20, 2020 to April 5, 2020. According to the final treatment outcomes, the patients were divided into the ""effective group"" and ""death group."" The clinical data of the two groups, such as the treatment process and final outcome, were retrospectively analyzed in order to determine the specific curative effects on the two groups and the reasons for the differences in such curative effects, as well as to explore the factors related to death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study enrolled 27 severe and critical COVID-19 patients, including 17 males (63.0%) and 10 females (37.0%). Their ages were 74.41 ± 11.73-years-old, and 19 patients (70.4%) were over 70-years-old. Severe COVID-19 patients over 70-years-old who were treated with mechanical ventilation died in 14 cases (82.4%); thus, this was the peak age. A total of 17 patients died of basic disease, 16 of whom had more than two basic diseases. The basic diseases were hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. At the same time, 13 patients (76.5%) died from an abnormal increase in blood glucose. Among them, eight had diabetes before contracting COVID-19 and five had a stress-induced increase in blood glucose after contracting COVID-19. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in one case. The use of tocilizumab may be a double-edged sword that carries a certain risk in clinical usage. Among the patients who died, 16 (94.1%) went into septic shock at the end. There were significant differences in the degree of infection, cardiac and renal function, and blood glucose between the death group and effective group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Age, blood glucose, cardiac and renal function, and inflammatory reaction are important indicators of poor prognosis for mechanical ventilation in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877282/,2022-11-28 02:45:39 AM
Disentanglement of Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) with reversible medetomidine-midazolam-butorphanol,"Brett R Gardner, Brandon Spolander, S Mduduzi Seakamela, Steven A McCue, Pieter G H Kotze, Maryke Musson, Brett R Gardner, Brandon Spolander, S Mduduzi Seakamela, Steven A McCue, Pieter G H Kotze, Maryke Musson",2021 May 21,"Anaesthesia in pinnipeds is considered a much higher risk than in most terrestrial mammals because of their frequent proximity to water and physiological and anatomical adaptations related to diving, which also influence their anaesthesia management. Anaesthetising and immobilising entangled seals does not allow for selection of animals that are at a safe distance from the water's edge. Medetomidine-midazolam-butorphanol (MMB) sedation was trialled on eight entangled Cape fur seals (CFS) (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) to determine if it was safe to use on animals that entered the water post-darting. The MMB was given at an estimated dose of 0.03 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, via remote darting. Sedation was reversed with intramuscular atipamezole (0.15 mg/kg) and naltrexone (0.4 mg/kg) to antagonise the effects of medetomidine and butorphanol, respectively. Moderate sedation was achieved in six animals. Six of the animals entered the water after being darted. There was a single mortality and a single animal that was too lightly sedated for capture. The preliminary results indicate that MMB produces suitable sedation for disentanglement of CFS.

Sport and Triad Risk Factors Influence Bone Mineral Density in Collegiate Athletes,"Adam S Tenforde, Jennifer L Carlson, Kristin L Sainani, Audrey O Chang, Jae Hyung Kim, Neville H Golden, Michael Fredericson, Adam S Tenforde, Jennifer L Carlson, Kristin L Sainani, Audrey O Chang, Jae Hyung Kim, Neville H Golden, Michael Fredericson",2018 Dec,"Purpose:
        
      
      Athletes in weight-bearing sports may benefit from higher bone mineral density (BMD). However, some athletes are at risk for impaired BMD with female athlete triad (Triad). The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of sports participation and Triad on BMD. We hypothesize that athletes in high-impact and multidirectional loading sports will have highest BMD, whereas nonimpact and low-impact sports will have lowest BMD. Triad risk factors are expected to reduce BMD values independent of sports participation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two hundred thirty-nine female athletes participating in 16 collegiate sports completed dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure BMD z-scores of the lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB). Height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). Triad risk assessment variables were obtained from preparticipation examination. Mean BMD z-scores were compared between sports and by sport category (high-impact, multidirectional, low-impact, and nonimpact). Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify differences of BMD z-scores accounting for Triad and body size/composition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Athlete populations with lowest average BMD z-scores included synchronized swimming (LS, -0.34; TB, 0.21) swimming/diving (LS, 0.34; TB, -0.06), crew/rowing (LS, 0.27; TB, 0.62), and cross-country (LS, 0.29; TB, 0.91). Highest values were in gymnastics (LS, 1.96; TB, 1.37), volleyball (LS, 1.90; TB, 1.74), basketball (LS, 1.73; TB, 1.99), and softball (LS, 1.68; TB, 1.78). All Triad risk factors were associated with lower BMD z-scores in univariable analyses; only low BMI and oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea were associated in multivariable analyses (all P < 0.05). Accounting for Triad risk factors and body size/composition, high-impact sports were associated with higher LS and TB BMD z-scores and nonimpact sports with lower LS and TB BMD z-scores compared to low-impact sport (all P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both sport type and Triad risk factors influence BMD. Athletes in low-impact and nonimpact sports and athletes with low BMI and oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea are at highest risk for reduced BMD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29975299/,2022-11-28 02:45:40 AM
"Sea-dumped chemical weapons: environmental risk, occupational hazard","M I Greenberg, K J Sexton, D Vearrier, M I Greenberg, K J Sexton, D Vearrier",2016,"Introduction:
        
      
      Chemical weapons dumped into the ocean for disposal in the twentieth century pose a continuing environmental and human health risk.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this review we discuss locations, quantity, and types of sea-dumped chemical weapons, related environmental concerns, and human encounters with sea-dumped chemical weapons.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We utilized the Ovid (http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) and PubMed (http://www.pubmed.org) search engines to perform MEDLINE searches for the terms 'sea-dumped chemical weapons', 'chemical warfare agents', and 'chemical munitions'. The searches returned 5863 articles. Irrelevant and non-English articles were excluded. A review of the references for these articles yielded additional relevant sources, with a total of 64 peer-reviewed articles cited in this paper. History and geography of chemical weapons dumping at sea: Hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical munitions were disposed off at sea following World War II. European, Russian, Japanese, and United States coasts are the areas most affected worldwide. Several areas in the Baltic and North Seas suffered concentrated large levels of dumping, and these appear to be the world's most studied chemical warfare agent marine dumping areas. Chemical warfare agents: Sulfur mustard, Lewisite, and the nerve agents appear to be the chemical warfare agents most frequently disposed off at sea. Multiple other type of agents including organoarsenicals, blood agents, choking agents, and lacrimators were dumped at sea, although in lesser volumes. Environmental concerns: Numerous geohydrologic variables contribute to the rate of release of chemical agents from their original casings, leading to difficult and inexact modeling of risk of release into seawater. Sulfur mustard and the organoarsenicals are the most environmentally persistent dumped chemical agents. Sulfur mustard in particular has a propensity to form a solid or semi-solid lump with a polymer coating of breakdown products, and can persist in this state on the ocean floor for decades. Rates of solubility and hydrolysis and levels of innate toxicity of a chemical agent are used to predict the risk to the marine environments. The organoarsenicals eventually breakdown into arsenic, and thus present an indefinite timeline for contamination. Generally, studies assaying sediment and water levels of parent chemical agents and breakdown products at dumpsites have found minimal amounts of relevant chemicals, although arsenic levels are typically higher in dumpsites than reference areas. Studies of marine organisms have not shown concerning amounts of chemical agents or breakdown products in tissue, but have shown evidence of chronic toxicity. There is believed to be minimal risk posed by seafood consumption. Microbiota assays of dumpsites are significantly altered in species composition compared to reference sites, which may imply unseen but significant changes to ecosystems of dumpsites. Human health concerns: The major human health risk at this time appears to arise from acute exposure to an agent by either accidental recovery of a chemical weapon on a fishing vessel, or by munitions washed ashore onto beaches.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Improving technology continues to make the deep sea more accessible, thus increasing the risk of disturbing munitions lying on or buried in the seabed. Pipe laying, cable burying, drilling, scuba diving, trawling, and undersea scientific research are the activities posing the most risk. The long-term threat to the benthic habitat via increased arsenic concentrations, shifts in microbiota speciation, and chronic toxicity to vertebrates and invertebrates is not currently understood. The risk to the environment of massive release via disturbance remains a distinct possibility. Terrorist recovery and re-weaponization of chemical agents is a remote possibility.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26692048/,2022-11-28 02:45:41 AM
High Prevalence and Putative Lineage Maintenance of Avian Coronaviruses in Scandinavian Waterfowl,"Michelle Wille, Shaman Muradrasoli, Anna Nilsson, Josef D Järhult, Michelle Wille, Shaman Muradrasoli, Anna Nilsson, Josef D Järhult",2016 Mar 3,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, and constitute a risk for zoonotic and emerging infectious disease. In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006/2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18.7%, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys. The highest prevalence was found in the diving ducks--mainly Greater Scaup (Aythya marila; 51.5%)--and the dabbling duck Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; 19.2%). Sequences from two of the Greater Scaup CoV fell into an infrequently detected lineage, shared only with a Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) CoV. Coronavirus sequences from Mallards in this study were highly similar to CoV sequences from the sample species and location in 2011, suggesting long-term maintenance in this population. A single Black-headed Gull represented the only positive sample from the order Charadriiformes. Globally, Anas species represent the largest fraction of avian CoV sequences, and there seems to be no host species, geographical or temporal structure. To better understand the eitiology, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected CoV is imperative.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26938459/,2022-11-28 02:45:42 AM
Does exposure to bentonite dust during tunnel hyperbaric interventions increase health risks for compressed air workers? A prospective qualitative and quantitative safety assessment,"Owen J O'Neill, Justin Costello, John Sullivan, Lisa Castellon, Owen J O'Neill, Justin Costello, John Sullivan, Lisa Castellon",2019,"Introduction:
        
      
      The mining and tunneling industries are historically associated with hazardous exposures that result in significant occupational health concerns. Occupational respiratory exposures causing pneumoconiosis and silicosis are of great concern, silicosis being non-curable. This work demonstrates that compressed-air workers (CAWs) performing tunnel hyperbaric interventions (HIs) may be at risk for hazards related to bentonite exposure, increasing the likelihood of developing harmful illnesses including cancer. Bentonite dust inhalation may result in respiratory levels of silica exceeding acceptable industrial hygiene standards.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A qualitative observational exposure assessment was conducted on CAWs while they were performing their HI duties. This was followed by quantitative data collection using personal and area air sample techniques. The results were analyzed and interpreted using standard industrial hygiene principles and guidelines from NIOSH and OSHA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our work suggests bentonite dust exposure may be an emerging particulate matter concern among CAWs in the tunneling industry. Aerosolized bentonite particles may have potential deleterious effects that include pneumoconiosis and silicosis. Silicosis can result in the development of pulmonary carcinoma.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The modern tunneling industry and required hyperbaric interventional tasks represent a potential public health and occupational concern for CAWs. This paper introduces the modern tunneling industry and the duties of CAWs, the hazardous environment in which they perform their duties, and describes the risks and potential harmful health effects associated with these hazardous exposures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509901/,2022-11-28 02:45:43 AM
Behavioral Diversity Across Classic Rodent Models Is Sex-Dependent,"José Colom-Lapetina, Anna J Li, Tatiana C Pelegrina-Perez, Rebecca M Shansky, José Colom-Lapetina, Anna J Li, Tatiana C Pelegrina-Perez, Rebecca M Shansky",2019 Mar 6,"Symptoms of trauma and stressor related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often develop well after the traumatic experience has occurred, and so identifying early predictors of risk or resilience is important for the implementation of interventional therapies. For example, passive coping strategies such as tonic immobility and peritraumatic dissociation during the trauma itself are risk factors for the developments of PTSD, especially in women. However, discrete, sex-specific coping responses that predict later outcomes in animal models have not been rigorously defined. Recently, we identified an active, escape-like response exhibited primarily by a subset of female rats in a classic auditory fear conditioning task (""darting""). Here, we asked whether darting during conditioning predicted active responding in a single forced swim (SFS) session to study the potential for darting to reflect a trait-like behavioral strategy that translated across stress models. Male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were tested in auditory fear conditioning acquisition and memory tests to identify Darters, and then a 15-min SFS 2 weeks later. We observed a significant effect of sex in conditioned freezing behavior, with males exhibiting greater freezing than females across conditioning and testing trials in comparison to females. However, females demonstrated higher velocities in response to shock presentations, and were more likely to exhibit darting behavior in response to the conditioned stimulus (CS). In SFS measures, females engaged in active behaviors such as climbing, head shaking, and diving in greater proportions than males, while males spent more time immobile throughout testing. Despite females exhibiting a more diverse behavioral repertoire in both tests, Darters did not differ from Non-darters in any SFS measure. These results suggest that the propensity to dart does not reflect a simple hyperactivity, and that despite conceptual overlap across the two tests (inescapable stress exposure and the ability to measure active vs. passive coping), the behavioral strategies engaged by an individual animal in each are likely driven by discrete mechanisms. We discuss potential challenges in interpretation of standard behavioral outcomes in classic models across the sexes, and consider the potential need for novel models that better tap into motivational states in females.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30894806/,2022-11-28 02:45:44 AM
Assessment of hyperbaric patients at risk of malnutrition using the Malnutrition Screening Tool - a pilot study,"Hooi Geok See, Yan Ru Tan, Kwan Leong Au-Yeung, Michael H Bennett, Hooi Geok See, Yan Ru Tan, Kwan Leong Au-Yeung, Michael H Bennett",2018 Dec 24,"Background:
        
      
      Nutritional assessment and support is essential for wound management. The hyperbaric oxygen clinic is a unique outpatient service where chronically unwell patients present daily for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) over several weeks, allowing time for effective nutritional intervention. This is the first study to examine the prevalence of those at risk of malnutrition in a cohort of hyperbaric medical patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective study was undertaken over six months. Following consent, 39 enrolled patients had the Malnutrition Screening Tool and Baseline Characteristic Collection Form completed. Those at risk of malnutrition were given an option to be assessed by a dietitian to complete a Subjective Global Assessment (SGA). At the completion of treatment, the patients completed a questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve of the 39 patients screened were at risk of malnutrition using our screening process. Of these, all the patients with available SGA results were diagnosed with moderate to severe malnutrition. Patients receiving HBOT for non-healing wounds and osteoradionecrosis were most at risk of malnutrition.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The prevalence of patients being at risk of malnutrition in our hyperbaric medical service was about one in three. Malnutrition screening should be part of routine patient assessment in order to ensure patients receive timely nutritional intervention. This may improve wound healing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517955/,2022-11-28 02:45:44 AM
Residual oxygen time model for oxygen partial pressure near 130 kPa (1.3 atm),"Barbara E Shykoff, Barbara E Shykoff",2015 Nov-Dec,"A two-part residual oxygen time model predicts the probability of detectible pulmonary oxygen toxicity P(P[O2tox]) after dives with oxygen partial pressure (PO2) approximately 130 kPa, and provides a tool to plan dive series with selected risk of P[O2tox]. Data suggest that pulmonary oxygen injury at this PO2 is additive between dives. Recovery begins after a delay and continues during any following dive. A logistic relation expresses P(P[O2tox]) as a function of dive duration (T(dur)) [hours]: P(P[O2tox]) = 100/[1+exp (3.586-0.49 x T(dur))] This expression maps T(dur) to P(P[O2tox]) or, in the linear mid-portion of the curve, P(P[O2tox]) usefully to T(dur). For multiple dives or during recovery, it maps to an equivalent dive duration, T(eq). T(eq) was found after second dives of duration T(dur 2). Residual time from the first dive t(r) = T(eq) - T(dur2). With known t(r), t and T(dur) a recovery model was fitted. t(r) = T(dur) x exp [-k x((t-5)/T(dur)2], where t = t - 5 hours, k = 0.149 for resting, and 0.047 for exercising divers, and t represents time after surfacing. The fits were assessed for 1,352 man-dives.

"Post-breeding movements of Ancient Murrelet Synthliboramphus antiquus family groups, subsequent migration of adults and implications for management","Anthony J Gaston, Yuriko Hashimoto, Laurie Wilson, Anthony J Gaston, Yuriko Hashimoto, Laurie Wilson",2017 Feb 24,"Increased shipping in British Columbia (BC) waters poses risks for marine birds from marine oil spills. Ancient Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus), small marine diving birds of which half of the world's population breeds in BC, are especially susceptible to oiling immediately after departing from their breeding colonies, as their offspring are flightless, constraining their parents to remain with them. In 2014 we deployed geolocator loggers on Ancient Murrelets at four breeding colonies, two on the east and two on the west coast of Haida Gwaii to investigate patterns of post-breeding dispersal and subsequent migratory movements. Birds from east coast colonies moved south and east after leaving their colonies, remaining in Queen Charlotte Sound and adjacent waters for 4-6 weeks, whereas those from west coast colonies moved steadily north and west, so that they left BC waters earlier than those from east coast colonies. These movements were consistent with being driven by surface currents. In June, all birds moved rapidly to the eastern Aleutians, SE Bering Sea, and waters off Kamchatka, where they probably moulted. In August, most moved north, some passing through Bering Straits into the Chukchi Sea. In October-November some birds returned to waters off western N America (33%) and the remainder carried on westwards to waters off Japan, Korea and NE China. For the former group the movement to the Bering Sea in June constituted a moult migration and, as such, is the first described for an auk. Those birds wintering in Asia began moving east in February and arrived off BC in March, when observations at colonies show that burrow visits begin in Haida Gwaii. Our data suggest that, immediately after colony departure, birds from the east coast colonies (about half the population of Haida Gwaii) are at higher risk from potential oil spills in northern British Columbia waters than those breeding on the west coast.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28235033/,2022-11-28 02:45:46 AM
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Has a Protective Effect on Decompression Sickness in Rats,"Aleksandra Mazur, Anthony Guernec, Jacky Lautridou, Julie Dupas, Emmanuel Dugrenot, Marc Belhomme, Michael Theron, François Guerrero, Aleksandra Mazur, Anthony Guernec, Jacky Lautridou, Julie Dupas, Emmanuel Dugrenot, Marc Belhomme, Michael Theron, François Guerrero",2018 Mar 1,"Introduction: Commercial divers, high altitude pilots, and astronauts are exposed to some inherent risk of decompression sickness (DCS), though the mechanisms that trigger are still unclear. It has been previously showed that diving may induce increased levels of serum angiotensin converting enzyme. The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the most important regulators of blood pressure and fluid volume. The purpose of the present study was to control the influence of angiotensin II on the appearance of DCS. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats have been pre-treated with inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (losartan; 10 mg/kg), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril; 10 mg/kg), and calcium-entry blocker (nifedipine; 20 mg/kg). The experimental groups were treated for 4 weeks before exposure to hyperbaric pressure while controls were not treated. Seventy-five rats were subjected to a simulated dive at 1000 kPa absolute pressure for 45 min before starting decompression. Clinical assessment took place over a period of 60 min after surfacing. Blood samples were collected for measurements of TBARS, interleukin 6 (IL-6), angiotensin II (ANG II) and ACE. Results: The diving protocol induced 60% DCS in non-treated animals. This ratio was significantly decreased after treatment with enalapril, but not other vasoactive drugs. Enalapril did not change ANG II or ACE concentration, while losartant decreased post dive level of ACE but not ANG II. None of the treatment modified the effect of diving on TBARS and IL-6 values. Conclusion: Results suggests that the rennin angiotensin system is involved in a process of triggering DCS but this has to be further investigated. However, a vasorelaxation mediated process, which potentially could increase the load of inert gas during hyperbaric exposure, and antioxidant properties were excluded by our results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29545754/,2022-11-28 02:45:47 AM
Long-term behavioral change as a result of acute ethanol exposure in zebrafish: Evidence for a role for sonic hedgehog but not retinoic acid signaling,"Derek F Burton, Chengjin Zhang, Oswald Boa-Amponsem, Shanta Mackinnon, Gregory J Cole, Derek F Burton, Chengjin Zhang, Oswald Boa-Amponsem, Shanta Mackinnon, Gregory J Cole",2017 May,"Background:
        
      
      Developmental exposure to ethanol is recognized to produce long-term neurobehavioral impairment in multiple animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits remain poorly understood. The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether two well-characterized targets of prenatal alcohol exposure, sonic hedgehog (Shh) and retinoic acid (RA), that induce the hallmark morphological phenotypes of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), are involved in the generation of behavioral alterations as a result of alcohol exposure.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Zebrafish embryos were exposed to ethanol (0%, 1%, 3%) at either 8-10 or 24-27h post-fertilization (hpf) and then evaluated during adolescence in the novel tank dive test to assess anxiety and risk-taking behavior. Overt signs of dysmorphogenesis were also scored and behavioral and morphological changes were compared for embryos treated with alcohol alone or in combination with subthreshold doses of shh or alhh1a3 morpholinos (MOs).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ethanol treated fish displayed altered tank diving behavior that was not exacerbated by combined MO treatment. While treatment of embryos with either shha mRNA or RA prior to ethanol exposure only ameliorated the altered tank diving response in the case of shha mRNA overexpression, dysmorphogenesis was rescued by both treatments.

Contribution of Adenosine in the Physiological Changes and Injuries Secondary to Exposure to Extreme Oxygen Pressure in Healthy Subjects,"Alain Boussuges, Jeremy Bourenne, Farid Eloufir, Julien Fromonot, Giovanna Mottola, Jean Jacques Risso, Nicolas Vallee, Fabienne Bregeon, Régis Guieu, Alain Boussuges, Jeremy Bourenne, Farid Eloufir, Julien Fromonot, Giovanna Mottola, Jean Jacques Risso, Nicolas Vallee, Fabienne Bregeon, Régis Guieu",2022 Aug 24,"Climbers and aviators are exposed to severe hypoxia at high altitudes, whereas divers are exposed to hyperoxia at depth. The aim of this study was to report changes in the adenosinergic system induced by exposure to extreme oxygen partial pressures. At high altitudes, the increased adenosine concentration contributes to brain protection against hypoxia through various mechanisms such as stimulation of glycogenolysis for ATP production, reduction in neuronal energy requirements, enhancement in 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate production, and increase in cerebral blood flow secondary to vasodilation of cerebral arteries. In the context of mountain illness, the increased level of A2AR expression leads to glial dysfunction through neuroinflammation and is involved in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Nonetheless, a high level of adenosine concentration can protect against high-altitude pulmonary edema via a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure. The adenosinergic system is also involved in the acclimatization phenomenon induced by prolonged exposure to altitude hypoxia. During hyperoxic exposure, decreased extracellular adenosine and low A2A receptor expression contribute to vasoconstriction. The resulting decrease in cerebral blood flow is considered a preventive phenomenon against cerebral oxygen toxicity through the decrease in oxygen delivery to the brain. With regard to lung oxygen toxicity, hyperoxia leads to an increase in extracellular adenosine, which acts to preserve pulmonary barrier function. Changes in the adenosinergic system induced by exposure to extreme oxygen partial pressures frequently have a benefit in decreasing the risk of adverse effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36140160/,2022-11-28 02:45:48 AM

Low Apgar scores in term newborns and long-term gastro-intestinal morbidity: a population-based cohort study with up to 18 years of follow-up,"Noa Leybovitz-Haleluya, Tamar Wainstock, Eyal Sheiner, Idit Segal, Daniella Landau, Asnat Walfisch, Noa Leybovitz-Haleluya, Tamar Wainstock, Eyal Sheiner, Idit Segal, Daniella Landau, Asnat Walfisch",2019 May,"Introduction:
        
      
      Low Apgar scores (<7) measured at age 5 minutes can predict short-term infant morbidity and mortality. Although an association exists between low Apgar scores and neuropsychological disorders, other childhood disorders were not thoroughly studied. We aimed to study the possible association between low 5-minute Apgar scores in term newborns and their long-term childhood gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A population-based cohort analysis was performed comparing total and different subtypes of GI-related pediatric hospitalizations among newborns with normal (≥7) and low (<7) 5-minute Apgar scores. The analysis included all term singletons born between the years 1999 and 2014 at a single tertiary regional medical center. Infants with congenital malformations, multiple gestations, and all perinatal deaths were excluded from the analysis. GI-related morbidities included hospitalizations involving a predefined set of ICD-9 codes, as recorded in the hospital computerized files. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed to compare the cumulative GI morbidity, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for confounders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study population, including 223 244 term singletons, was followed for an average of 10.02 ± 6.0 years (0-18 years, median 10.25) following discharge from birth hospitalization. Low 5-minute Apgar scores were recorded in 585 (0.3%) newborns. Incidence of GI-related hospitalizations was higher among the low versus the normal 5-minute Apgar score group (7.4 versus 5.2%; 8.6/1000 person years (PY) versus 5.2/1000 PY, respectively; p = .02; odds ratio =1.66, 95%CI 1.36-1.96). The association remained significant and independent while adjusting for gestational age, fetal weight, offspring gender, maternal age, maternal smoking, hypertension, and diabetes (Adjusted HR =1.57, 95%CI 1.16-2.12, p = .003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Low 5 minutes Apgar score is associated with an increased risk for long-term pediatric GI morbidity of the offspring. Our results suggest that Apgar scores can be used as a possible predictor for long-term pediatric morbidities and thus may necessitate appropriate surveillance in this vulnerable group of children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29183177/,2022-11-28 02:45:50 AM
Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome,"Bert Callewaert, Anne De Paepe, Paul Coucke, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Bert Callewaert, Anne De Paepe, Paul Coucke, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is characterized by widespread elongation and tortuosity of the aorta and mid-sized arteries as well as focal stenosis of segments of the pulmonary arteries and/or aorta combined with findings of a generalized connective tissue disorder, which may include soft or doughy hyperextensible skin, joint hypermobility, inguinal hernia, and diaphragmatic hernia. Skeletal findings include pectus excavatum or carinatum, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, knee/elbow contractures, and camptodactyly. The cardiovascular system is the major source of morbidity and mortality with increased risk at any age for aneurysm formation and dissection both at the aortic root and throughout the arterial tree, and for ischemic vascular events involving cerebrovascular circulation (resulting in non-hemorrhagic stroke) and the abdominal arteries (resulting in infarctions of abdominal organs).
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of ATS is established in a proband with generalized arterial tortuosity and biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in SLC2A10 identified by molecular genetic testing.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Individuals with ATS benefit from a coordinated approach of multidisciplinary specialists in a medical center familiar with ATS. Although hemodynamic stress on arterial walls can be reduced with use of beta-adrenergic blockers or other medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor 1 (ATIIR1) antagonists such as losartan, the efficacy of these treatments has not been established in ATS and caution is warranted when using blood pressure-lowering medications in the presence of arterial stenosis (anatomic or functional due to severe tortuosity), especially renal artery stenosis. Aneurysms and focal stenoses are amenable to surgical intervention. Wound healing may be delayed following surgery; thus, stitches should be placed without traction and remain in place approximately ten days. A supporting mesh can be used in the surgical repair of hernias to reduce recurrence risk. Skeletal manifestations such as scoliosis require management by an orthopedist; ocular manifestations require management when possible by an ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders.
    

Surveillance: Regular cardiovascular follow up with: echocardiography every three months until age five years; and MRA or CT scan with 3D reconstruction from head to pelvis annually starting at birth or at the time of diagnosis. Monitoring of blood pressure at every visit. Orthodontic evaluation for possible dental crowding during eruption of permanent teeth; radiographs to evaluate for the progression of scoliosis, especially during periods of rapid growth; follow up for refractive errors and keratoconus with ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; scuba diving; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system (including routine use of decongestants); tobacco use; sun tanning.
    

Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband with ATS in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and surveillance for complications.
    

Pregnancy management: Data on the management of women with arterial tortuosity syndrome during pregnancy and delivery are limited. Preconception counseling should include possible pregnancy-associated risks to the mother (mainly aortic root dilatation and dissection) and recommendation to discontinue medications with possible teratogenic effects (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I], angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists [ATIIR1] such as losartan, and anticoagulant therapy) and to begin therapy with β-blockers.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      ATS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC2A10 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once the SLC2A10 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25392904/,2022-11-28 02:45:50 AM
Oxygen toxicity seizure mimics,"Kevin Foley, Neil Banham, Samantha Bonnington, Ian Gawthrope, Kevin Foley, Neil Banham, Samantha Bonnington, Ian Gawthrope",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Oxygen toxicity seizures (OTS) are a well-recognised complication of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). As such, seizure-like activity during HBOT is usually presumed to be a result of central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT). Four cases are reported here where causes other than CNS-OT were determined as being the likely cause of the seizure; causes we have labelled 'OTS mimics'. Through review of the current literature, and our hyperbaric medicine unit's experience to date, we aimed to highlight the relevance of these OTS mimics, as the potential for significant morbidity and mortality exists with incorrect diagnoses.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients treated at the Fiona Stanley Hospital and Fremantle Hospital hyperbaric medicine units who had a seizure during HBOT between November 1989 and June 2020. These events were reviewed to determine whether causes for seizures other than oxygen toxicity were evident.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four OTS mimics were identified: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, pethidine toxicity, previous subarachnoid haemorrhage with resultant epilepsy, and severe hypoglycaemia.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This case series highlights the need for caution when diagnosing an apparent OTS. Multiple conditions may mimic the signs and symptoms of oxygen toxicity. This creates scope for misdiagnosis, with potential for consequent morbidity and mortality. A pragmatic approach is necessary to any patient exhibiting seizure-like activity during HBOT, with suspicion for other underlying pathologies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157731/,2022-11-28 02:45:51 AM
Fumigation on bulk cargo ships: a chemical threat to seafarers,"Rune Djurhuus, Rune Djurhuus",2021,"Fumigation is a process that is carried out to prevent deterioration of goods by pests and spread of unwanted organisms for example during long-distance carriage by sea. Several intoxications due to use of pesticides on bulk cargo ships have been indicated, but for some of these incidents the documentation are questionable. The objective of the present study was therefore to examine the extent of the problem by collecting available information of incidents or intoxications due to use of pesticides on bulk cargo ships. Information sources such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Gard (marine insurance company), Marine Accident Investigation Branch, United Kingdom, and Professional Mariner (a magazine) were searched using similar search phrases. The results indicate that the present practice of fumigation with pesticides of cargo holds on bulk ships represents a serious health risk to both seafarers and port workers. A thorough search for information in both scientific and non-scientific sources revealed a number of intoxications including several fatalities. According to the available documentation, phosphine seems to be used more or less exclusively as fumigant on bulk cargo ships today. Phosphine has a high acute toxicity, and recent findings suggest long-term effects. Several of the reported incidents point to lack of knowledge and neglecting of recommended procedures as key elements in this respect. The problem is likely underestimated due to lack of available documentation of several incidents. Preventive actions should be implemented that focus on documentation of incidents, increase knowledge of pesticide health hazard and implementation of safety procedures that are mandatory to perform when fumigated cargo is to be handled on bulk ships.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34604991/,2022-11-28 02:45:52 AM
Diving into the unknown: identification of antimicrobial resistance hotspots in a tropical urban estuary,"A L B Canellas, W F da Costa, R Paranhos, M S Laport, A L B Canellas, W F da Costa, R Paranhos, M S Laport",2021 Sep,"Antimicrobial resistance is widely studied and well-characterized from a clinical perspective.

Water samples from sites characterized by growing degrees of pollution were analysed by culture-dependent methods, revealing the presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and clinically relevant indicators of antimicrobial resistance, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry, which indicated the presence of potential human pathogens such as Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp. Bacteria harbouring beta-lactam resistance genes were also detected. Although GB is widely used as a recreational and fishing area, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and the risk that exposure to these waters poses to public health. Thus, this study reveals new information that calls for better comprehension of antimicrobial resistance in aquatic environments, especially those used for recreational purposes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34146437/,2022-11-28 02:45:52 AM
Leaves of Spondias mombin L. a traditional anxiolytic and antidepressant: Pharmacological evaluation on zebrafish (Danio rerio),"Tafnis Ingret Dos Santos Sampaio, Nayara Costa de Melo, Bianca Thais de Freitas Paiva, Gerley Anatê da Silva Aleluia, Fernando Luiz Pinheiro da Silva Neto, Heitor Ribeiro da Silva, Hady Keita, Rodrigo Alves Soares Cruz, Brenda Lorena Sánchez-Ortiz, Elizabeth Arlen Pineda-Peña, José Luis Balderas, Andres Navarrete, José Carlos Tavares Carvalho, Tafnis Ingret Dos Santos Sampaio, Nayara Costa de Melo, Bianca Thais de Freitas Paiva, Gerley Anatê da Silva Aleluia, Fernando Luiz Pinheiro da Silva Neto, Heitor Ribeiro da Silva, Hady Keita, Rodrigo Alves Soares Cruz, Brenda Lorena Sánchez-Ortiz, Elizabeth Arlen Pineda-Peña, José Luis Balderas, Andres Navarrete, José Carlos Tavares Carvalho",2018 Oct 5,"Ethnobotanical relevance:
        
      
      Spondias mombin L. is a plant dispersed throughout the tropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia, being found mainly in the North and Northeast of Brazil, where the leaves are used in preparations for neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to carry out studies in different pharmacological models that can prove the traditional use of this plant species.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      the hydroethanolic extract from S. mombin leaves (HELSm) was evaluated by oral administration (25 mg/kg) and by immersion (25 mg/l) in scototaxis test in zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this study, caffeine (100 mg/kg) and buspirone (25 mg/kg) were used as standard drugs. The antidepressant action of the HELSm was evaluated assessed in the novel tank diving test (NTDT). In this study, a group with 1% ethanol, one with unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), and another with developmental, social isolation (DSI) were used as induction groups for depression-like behavior and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) as a drug pattern.
    


          Results:
        
      
      by the HPLC-UV fingerprint analysis, the HELSm presented several derivatives of polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids and identified ellagic acid and isoquercitrin, and by the gas-chromatographic, the majority of the identified compounds were fatty acids, esters, and alcohols. By immersion, the LC50 was 49.86 mg/l and by oral via the LD50 in 48 h, was 4.515 g/kg in zebrafish. For all spatiotemporal and behavioral variables (time spent, white compartment, latency, toggle, erratic swimming, freezing duration, thigmotaxis, and risk assessment), the treatment with HELSm produced a similar effect to buspirone and was significant when compared to the caffeine and control group (p < 0.01, Tukey-Kramer test). For all spatiotemporal and behavioral variables evaluated (time spent at the top of the apparatus, crossed quadrants, erratic swimming, and duration of freezing), treatment with HELSm produced a change in the depression-like behavior in the groups tested, with a similar effect to fluoxetine, both with a significant difference when compared to the control groups (p < 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that the acute administration of the HELSm in the scototaxis and NTDT tests in a zebrafish model (Danio rerio) produced anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, devoid of hypnotic and sedative actions by immersion, and this action was improved when administered by oral via. Possibly, the presence of isoquercitrin in the leaves of Spondias mombin participates in the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29852265/,2022-11-28 02:45:53 AM
Physiological consequences of Arctic sea ice loss on large marine carnivores: unique responses by polar bears and narwhals,"Anthony M Pagano, Terrie M Williams, Anthony M Pagano, Terrie M Williams",2021 Feb 24,"Rapid environmental changes in the Arctic are threatening the survival of marine species that rely on the predictable presence of the sea ice. Two Arctic marine mammal specialists, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros), appear especially vulnerable to the speed and capriciousness of sea ice deterioration as a consequence of their unique hunting behaviors and diet, as well as their physiological adaptations for slow-aerobic exercise. These intrinsic characteristics limit the ability of these species to respond to extrinsic threats associated with environmental change and increased industrial activity in a warming Arctic. In assessing how sea ice loss may differentially affect polar bears that hunt on the ice surface and narwhals that hunt at extreme depths below, we found that major ice loss translated into elevated locomotor costs that range from 3- to 4-fold greater than expected for both species. For polar bears this instigates an energy imbalance from the combined effects of reduced caloric intake and increased energy expenditure. For narwhals, high locomotor costs during diving increase the risk of ice entrapment due to the unreliability of breathing holes. These species-specific physiological constraints and extreme reliance on the polar sea ice conspire to make these two marine mammal specialists sentinels of climate change within the Arctic marine ecosystem that may foreshadow rapid changes to the marine ecosystem.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33627459/,2022-11-28 02:45:54 AM
Dual-Task Interference Between Swimming and Verbal Memory,"Andrew Stets, Samantha L Smith, William S Helton, Andrew Stets, Samantha L Smith, William S Helton",2020 Nov,"Objective:
        
      
      A dual-task study was performed to explore the performance effects for swimming, word recall, and the combination of the two tasks performed simultaneously.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Dual-task interference studies have been performed for a variety of tasks; however, there has not been much dual-task interference research where one of the tasks is a naturalistic physically strenuous task. Swimming is a unique physical task that requires spatial orientation on three dimensional axes, similar to that of flying, but has no risk of falling. Previous studies have been conducted in other activity combinations with word-free recall, such as running and climbing, but swimming has yet to be explored.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A verbal memory recall task and swimming task were performed in isolated (single-task) and simultaneous conditions. A comparison of effects across these different activities was also explored.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Swimming and the word-recall task resulted in significant dual-task interference: almost as much as when word recall was paired with another verbal task, but more than running and less than climbing.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Consistent with other dual-task studies, this study observed dual-task interference between the physical swimming task and the cognitive verbal memory task.

Unmanned aerial vehicles for surveying marine fauna: assessing detection probability,"Amanda Hodgson, David Peel, Natalie Kelly, Amanda Hodgson, David Peel, Natalie Kelly",2017 Jun,"Aerial surveys are conducted for various fauna to assess abundance, distribution, and habitat use over large spatial scales. They are traditionally conducted using light aircraft with observers recording sightings in real time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer an alternative with many potential advantages, including eliminating human risk. To be effective, this emerging platform needs to provide detection rates of animals comparable to traditional methods. UAVs can also acquire new types of information, and this new data requires a reevaluation of traditional analyses used in aerial surveys; including estimating the probability of detecting animals. We conducted 17 replicate UAV surveys of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) while simultaneously obtaining a 'census' of the population from land-based observations, to assess UAV detection probability. The ScanEagle UAV, carrying a digital SLR camera, continuously captured images (with 75% overlap) along transects covering the visual range of land-based observers. We also used ScanEagle to conduct focal follows of whale pods (n = 12, mean duration = 40 min), to assess a new method of estimating availability. A comparison of the whale detections from the UAV to the land-based census provided an estimated UAV detection probability of 0.33 (CV = 0.25; incorporating both availability and perception biases), which was not affected by environmental covariates (Beaufort sea state, glare, and cloud cover). According to our focal follows, the mean availability was 0.63 (CV = 0.37), with pods including mother/calf pairs having a higher availability (0.86, CV = 0.20) than those without (0.59, CV = 0.38). The follows also revealed (and provided a potential correction for) a downward bias in group size estimates from the UAV surveys, which resulted from asynchronous diving within whale pods, and a relatively short observation window of 9 s. We have shown that UAVs are an effective alternative to traditional methods, providing a detection probability that is within the range of previous studies for our target species. We also describe a method of assessing availability bias that represents spatial and temporal characteristics of a survey, from the same perspective as the survey platform, is benign, and provides additional data on animal behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28178755/,2022-11-28 02:45:56 AM
Protecting the environment from psychoactive drugs: Problems for regulators illustrated by the possible effects of tramadol on fish behaviour,"Rumi Tanoue, Luigi Margiotta-Casaluci, Belinda Huerta, Tamsin J Runnalls, Akifumi Eguchi, Kei Nomiyama, Tatsuya Kunisue, Shinsuke Tanabe, John P Sumpter, Rumi Tanoue, Luigi Margiotta-Casaluci, Belinda Huerta, Tamsin J Runnalls, Akifumi Eguchi, Kei Nomiyama, Tatsuya Kunisue, Shinsuke Tanabe, John P Sumpter",2019 May 10,"There is concern that psychoactive drugs present in the aquatic environment could affect the behaviour of fish, and other organisms, adversely. There is considerable experimental support for this concern, although the literature is not consistent. To investigate why, fish were exposed to three concentrations of the synthetic opiate tramadol for 23-24 days, and their anxiolytic behaviour in a novel tank diving test was assessed both before and after exposure. The results were difficult to interpret. The positive control drug, the anti-depressant fluoxetine, produced the expected results: exposed fish explored the novel tank more, and swam more slowly while doing so. An initial statistical analysis of the results provided relatively weak support for the conclusion that both the low and high concentrations of tramadol affected fish behaviour, but no evidence that the intermediate concentration did. To gain further insight, UK and Japanese experts in ecotoxicology were asked for their independent opinions on the data for tramadol. These were highly valuable. For example, about half the experts replied that a low concentration of a chemical can cause effects that higher concentrations do not, although a similar number did not believe this was possible. Based both on the inconclusive effects of tramadol on the behaviour of the fish and the very varied opinions of experts on the correct interpretation of those inconclusive data, it is obvious that more research on the behavioural effects of tramadol, and probably all other psychoactive drugs, on aquatic organisms is required before any meaningful risk assessments can be conducted. The relevance of these findings may apply much more widely than just the environmental risk assessment of psychoactive drugs. They suggest that much more rigorous training of research scientists and regulators is probably required if consensus decisions are to be reached that adequately protect the environment from chemicals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30769315/,2022-11-28 02:45:57 AM
Sudden death after oxygen toxicity seizure during hyperbaric oxygen treatment: Case report,"Rutger C Lalieu, René D Bol Raap, Emile Fl Dubois, Rob A van Hulst, Rutger C Lalieu, René D Bol Raap, Emile Fl Dubois, Rob A van Hulst",2020 Jun 30,"Acute cerebral oxygen toxicity (ACOT) is a known side effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), which can cause generalised seizures.

Symptoms of CO poisoning are nonspecific and can range from dizziness, headache, and angina pectoris to unconsciousness and death. This guideline presents the current state of knowledge and national recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CO poisoning. The diagnosis of CO poisoning is based on clinical symptoms and proven or probable exposure to CO. Negative carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels should not rule out CO poisoning if the history and symptoms are consistent with this phenomenon. Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, impairment of the cellular respiratory chain, and immunomodulatory processes may result in myocardial and central nervous tissue damage even after a reduction in COHb. If CO poisoning is suspected, 100% oxygen breathing should be immediately initiated in the prehospital setting. Clinical symptoms do not correlate with COHb elimination from the blood; therefore, COHb monitoring alone is unsuitable for treatment management. Especially in the absence of improvement despite treatment, a reevaluation for other possible differential diagnoses ought to be performed. Evidence regarding the benefit of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is scant and the subject of controversy due to the heterogeneity of studies. If required, HBOT should be initiated within 6 h. All patients with CO poisoning should be informed about the risk of delayed neurological sequelae (DNS).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867135/,2022-11-28 02:45:58 AM

Investigating the anatomy and sensory apparatuses of these animals is essential to understanding their ecology and evolution, and informs efforts for their conservation. Here, we use X-ray CT scans to compare aspects of the endocranial and inner ear labyrinth anatomy of extant monodontids and use the overall morphology to draw larger inferences about the relationship between morphology and ecology. We show that differences in the shape of the brain, vasculature, and neural canals of both species may relate to differences in diving and other behaviors. The cochleae are similar in morphology in the two species, signifying similar hearing ranges and a close evolutionary relationship. Lastly, we compare two different methods for calculating 90var - a calculation independent of body size that is increasingly being used as a proxy for habitat preference. We show that a 'direct' angular measurement method shows significant differences between Arctic and other habitat preferences, but angle measurements based on planes through the semicircular canals do not, emphasizing the need for more detailed study and standardization of this measurement. This work represents the first comparative internal anatomical study of the endocranium and inner ear labyrinths of this small clade of toothed whales.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30033539/,2022-11-28 02:45:59 AM
Physiological responses during paramedics' simulated driving tasks,"Mathieu Tremblay, Wayne J Albert, Steven L Fischer, Eric Beairsto, Michel J Johnson, Mathieu Tremblay, Wayne J Albert, Steven L Fischer, Eric Beairsto, Michel J Johnson",2020,"Background:
        
      
      Most ambulance collisions happen in emergency driving conditions and are caused by human factors.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study investigated the influence of human factors associated with time pressure, patient-care intervention, and health status on the physiological responses of simulated emergency driving tasks.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cohort of seventeen experienced paramedics performed a battery of three simulated diving tasks. The driving tasks were a non-urgent and two urgent driving simulations (one to the scene and one to the hospital). The second urgent driving task was preceded by a patient-care simulation (unstable cardiac patient with cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The physiological responses between the three driving tasks were not significantly different due to time pressure and patient-care intervention. It is postulated that the physiological response of experienced paramedics was influenced by the fact that they are accustomed to handling stressful situations daily. Furthermore, it was observed that paramedics with health conditions were more physiologically aroused during the urgent driving scenarios (pre and post-intervention), suggesting they might have an elevated risk of collision when they drive with urgency. Paramedics with health conditions also had higher physiological responses for the post-intervention baseline, leading to a longer recovery time period, which might represent an elevated risk of developing chronic health problems or amplifying existing ones.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings of this research suggest that experienced paramedics manage the influence of time pressure and the impact of challenging patient-care well.

Mechanism of action of antiplatelet drugs on decompression sickness in rats: a protective effect of anti-GPIIbIIIa therapy,"Kate Lambrechts, Jean-Michel Pontier, Aleksandra Mazur, Michaël Theron, Peter Buzzacott, Qiong Wang, Marc Belhomme, François Guerrero, Kate Lambrechts, Jean-Michel Pontier, Aleksandra Mazur, Michaël Theron, Peter Buzzacott, Qiong Wang, Marc Belhomme, François Guerrero",2015 May 15,"Literature highlights the involvement of disseminated thrombosis in the pathophysiology of decompression sickness (DCS). We examined the effect of several antithrombotic treatments targeting various pathways on DCS outcome: acetyl salicylate, prasugrel, abciximab, and enoxaparin. Rats were randomly assigned to six groups. Groups 1 and 2 were a control nondiving group (C; n = 10) and a control diving group (CD; n = 30). Animals in Groups 3 to 6 were treated before hyperbaric exposure (HBE) with either prasugrel (n = 10), acetyl salicylate (n = 10), enoxaparin (n = 10), or abciximab (n = 10). Blood samples were taken for platelet factor 4 (PF4), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and von Willebrand factor analysis. Onset of DCS symptoms and death were recorded during a 60-min observation period after HBE. Although we observed fewer outcomes of DCS in all treated groups compared with the CD, statistical significance was reached in abciximab only (20% vs. 73%, respectively, P = 0.007). We also observed significantly higher levels of plasmatic PF4 in abciximab (8.14 ± 1.40 ng/ml; P = 0.004) and enoxaparin groups (8.01 ± 0.80 ng/ml; P = 0.021) compared with the C group (6.45 ± 1.90 ng/ml) but not CD group (8.14 ± 1.40 ng/ml). Plasmatic levels of TBARS were significantly higher in the CD group than the C group (49.04 ± 11.20 μM vs. 34.44 ± 5.70 μM, P = 0.002). This effect was prevented by all treatments. Our results suggest that abciximab pretreatment, a powerful glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, has a strong protective effect on decompression risk by significantly improving DCS outcome. Besides its powerful inhibitory action on platelet aggregation, we suggest that abciximab could also act through its effects on vascular function, oxidative stress, and/or inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25792711/,2022-11-28 02:46:01 AM
"Environmental influences on the abundance and sexual composition of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias in Gansbaai, South Africa","Alison V Towner, Les G Underhill, Oliver J D Jewell, Malcolm J Smale, Alison V Towner, Les G Underhill, Oliver J D Jewell, Malcolm J Smale",2013 Aug 12,"The seasonal occurrence of white sharks visiting Gansbaai, South Africa was investigated from 2007 to 2011 using sightings from white shark cage diving boats. Generalized linear models were used to investigate the number of great white sharks sighted per trip in relation to sex, month, sea surface temperature and Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Indices (MEI). Water conditions are more variable in summer than winter due to wind-driven cold water upwelling and thermocline displacement, culminating in colder water temperatures, and shark sightings of both sexes were higher during the autumn and winter months (March-August). MEI, an index to quantify the strength of Southern Oscillation, differed in its effect on the recorded numbers of male and female white sharks, with highly significant interannual trends. This data suggests that water temperature and climatic phenomena influence the abundance of white sharks at this coastal site. In this study, more females were seen in Gansbaai overall in warmer water/positive MEI years. Conversely, the opposite trend was observed for males. In cool water years (2010 to 2011) sightings of male sharks were significantly higher than in previous years. The influence of environmental factors on the physiology of sharks in terms of their size and sex is discussed. The findings of this study could contribute to bather safety programmes because the incorporation of environmental parameters into predictive models may help identify times and localities of higher risk to bathers and help mitigate human-white shark interactions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23951111/,2022-11-28 02:46:01 AM

      In Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) Open Water Diver certification courses that cater to tourists, instruction is often condensed and potentially delivered in a language that is not the candidate's native language.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the incidence of middle ear barotrauma (MEBt) in open-water diver candidates during a condensed four-day certification course, and to determine if language of instruction affects the incidence of MEBt in these divers.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The ears of participating diving candidates were assessed prior to commencing any in-water compression. Tympanic membranes (TM) were assessed and graded for MEBt after the confined and open-water training sessions. Tympanometry was performed if the candidate had no movement of their TM during Valsalva. Photographs were taken with a digital otoscope.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-seven candidates participated in the study. Forty-eight had MEBt at some time during their course. MEBt was not associated with instruction in non-native language (adjusted odds ratio = 0.82; 95% confidence intervals 0.21-3.91). There was also no significant association between the severity of MEBt and language of instruction.

One recent gas dynamics model used available lung and tracheal compliance data from various species. As variation in respiratory compliance significantly affects alveolar compression and pulmonary shunt, the current study objective was to evaluate changes in model output when using species-specific parameters from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). We explored the effects of lung and dead space compliance on the uptake of N2, O2, and CO2 in various tissues during a series of hypothetical dives. The updated parameters allowed for increased compliance of the lungs and an increased stiffness in the trachea. When comparing updated model output with a model using previous compliance values, there was a large decrease in N2 uptake but little change in O2 and CO2 levels. Therefore, previous models may overestimate N2 tensions and the risk of gas-related disease, such as decompression sickness (DCS), in marine mammals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27562522/,2022-11-28 02:46:03 AM
Consensus on Postoperative Recommendations After Transsphenoidal Surgery,"Ulrich J Knappe, Dag Moskopp, Rüdiger Gerlach, Jens Conrad, Jörg Flitsch, Jürgen B Honegger, Ulrich J Knappe, Dag Moskopp, Rüdiger Gerlach, Jens Conrad, Jörg Flitsch, Jürgen B Honegger",2019 Jan,"Background:
        
      
      Guidelines for patient behavior following transsphenoidal surgery do not exist. To gain generally recommendations, the German pituitary working group conducted a study among pituitary surgeons to elucidate their opinions and customs of patients' counselling.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Questions concerning daily activities, exertion of sports and work life were addressed. It was asked to provide the postoperative time interval after which specific activities can be resumed both after a routine or an extended approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fourteen pituitary surgeons returned the completed questionnaire. Following routine operations, washing the hair was allowed within one week, blowing the nose after 3, flying on an airplane and driving a car after one, lifting heavy weights after 4, playing wind instruments after 6, use of CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device after 3, permit leisure sports after 2 to 4 weeks (except for scuba diving). Competitive sports can be resumed after 6 weeks. Occupation with mental demands was considered feasible after 2 weeks, with physical labor after 4 weeks. After extended transsphenoidal surgery, the recommended time interval was roughly twice as long compared to the routine approach. Driving a car was allowed within the first 4 weeks after surgery by some pituitary surgeons, while others allow driving only after 3 months analogous to the regulations after craniotomy. The risk of scuba diving was considered high.
    


          Conclusions:

Nanobubbles Form at Active Hydrophobic Spots on the Luminal Aspect of Blood Vessels: Consequences for Decompression Illness in Diving and Possible Implications for Autoimmune Disease-An Overview,"Ran Arieli, Ran Arieli",2017 Aug 15,"Decompression illness (DCI) occurs following a reduction in ambient pressure. Decompression bubbles can expand and develop only from pre-existing gas micronuclei. The different hypotheses hitherto proposed regarding the nucleation and stabilization of gas micronuclei have never been validated. It is known that nanobubbles form spontaneously when a smooth hydrophobic surface is submerged in water containing dissolved gas. These nanobubbles may be the long sought-after gas micronuclei underlying decompression bubbles and DCI. We exposed hydrophobic and hydrophilic silicon wafers under water to hyperbaric pressure. After decompression, bubbles appeared on the hydrophobic but not the hydrophilic wafers. In a further series of experiments, we placed large ovine blood vessels in a cooled high pressure chamber at 1,000 kPa for about 20 h. Bubbles evolved at definite spots in all the types of blood vessels. These bubble-producing spots stained positive for lipids, and were henceforth termed ""active hydrophobic spots"" (AHS). The lung surfactant dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), was found both in the plasma of the sheep and at the AHS. Bubbles detached from the blood vessel in pulsatile flow after reaching a mean diameter of ~1.0 mm. Bubble expansion was bi-phasic-a slow initiation phase which peaked 45 min after decompression, followed by fast diffusion-controlled growth. Many features of decompression from diving correlate with this finding of AHS on the blood vessels. (1) Variability between bubblers and non-bubblers. (2) An age-related effect and adaptation. (3) The increased risk of DCI on a second dive. (4) Symptoms of neurologic decompression sickness. (5) Preconditioning before a dive. (6) A bi-phasic mechanism of bubble expansion. (7) Increased bubble formation with depth. (8) Endothelial injury. (9) The presence of endothelial microparticles. Finally, constant contact between nanobubbles and plasma may result in distortion of proteins and their transformation into autoantigens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28861003/,2022-11-28 02:46:04 AM
A Systematic Review of the Causes and Management of Ischaemic Stroke Caused by Nontissue Emboli,"Ciaran Judge, Sarah Mello, David Bradley, Joseph Harbison, Ciaran Judge, Sarah Mello, David Bradley, Joseph Harbison",2017,"Introduction:
        
      
      The inadvertent or purposeful introduction of foreign bodies or substances can lead to cerebral infarction if they embolize to the brain. Individual reports of these events are uncommon but may increase with the increased occurrences of their risk factors, for example, intra-arterial procedures.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for articles on embolic stroke of nontissue origin. 1889 articles were identified and screened and 216 articles were ultimately reviewed in full text and included in qualitative analysis. Articles deemed relevant were assessed by a second reviewer to confirm compatibility with the inclusion criteria. References of included articles were reviewed for relevant publications. We categorized the pathology of the emboli into the following groups: air embolism (141 reports), other arterial gas embolisms (49 reports), missiles and foreign bodies (16 reports), and others, including drug embolism, cotton wool, and vascular sclerosant agents.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Air and gaseous embolism are becoming more common with increased use of interventional medical procedures and increased popularity of sports such as diving. There is increasing evidence for the use of hyperbaric oxygen for such events. Causes of solid emboli are diverse.

Risk factors for cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs participating in canine agility,"Debra C Sellon, Denis J Marcellin-Little, Debra C Sellon, Denis J Marcellin-Little",2022 Jan 15,"Background:
        
      
      Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR) is one of the most common causes of pelvic limb lameness in dogs. Risk factors for CCLR include breed (especially large and giant breeds), body weight, gender and spay/neuter status, and age. Few studies have evaluated physical activity and fitness indicators, however, as risk factors for disease. This study used an online questionnaire distributed primarily via social media to assess risk factors for CCLR in dogs actively engaged in agility training or competition to determine demographic and physical activity factors associated with rupture.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data from 260 dogs with CCLR were compared to similar data from 1006 dogs without CCLR. All dogs were actively training or competing in agility at the time of CCLR or the time of data submission, respectively. Physical characteristics associated with increased risk of CCLR included younger age, spayed female sex, greater body weight, and greater weight to height ratio. Agility activities associated with increased odds ratios included competition in events sponsored by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC), competing at novice and intermediate levels, and competing in fewer than 10 events/year. Odds ratios were lower in dogs that competed in events sponsored by United Kingdom Agility International (UKI). Other activities associated with increased odds ratio for CCLR included involvement in flyball activities and short walks or runs over hilly or flat terrain on a weekly basis. Activities associated with decreased odds ratio included involvement in dock diving, barn hunt, nosework, or lure coursing/racing activities and participation in core balance and strength exercises at least weekly.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that body weight and spay/neuter status are risk factors for CCLR in dogs. This is the first report to demonstrate that risk of CCLR in agility dogs is decreased in dogs that engage in regular core strengthening exercises, compete more frequently, compete at higher levels, and compete in more athletically challenging venues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35033070/,2022-11-28 02:46:06 AM
Investigation of a cluster of decompression sickness cases following a high-altitude chamber flight,"Nazim Ata, Erkan Karaca, Nazim Ata, Erkan Karaca",2021 Mar 31,"Although relatively safe, hypoxia exposure is a mandatory training requirement for aircrew that carries the risk of decompression sickness (DCS). Usually DCS affects only one individual at a time. Here, a cluster of three simultaneous cases is reported. Since these numbers were well in excess of the usually encountered incidence rate, the purpose of this work was to identify the most likely reasons using the epidemic DCS investigation framework which involves four main considerations: time; place; population; and environment. Based on time and place observations, this cluster clearly falls into the individual-based classification, where the environment is a primary concern. Indeed, equipment analysis allowed us to identify the most likely reason for two out of three cases (perforations in the oro-nasal oxygen masks worn during training). It led to replacement of damaged equipment and modification of teaching to prevent such damage.

      Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been advocated in the prevention and treatment of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw after head and neck radiation therapy, but supporting evidence is weak. The aim of this randomized trial was to establish the benefit of HBO in the prevention of ORN after high-risk surgical procedures to the irradiated mandible.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      HOPON was a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial. Participants who required dental extractions or implant placement in the mandible with prior radiation therapy >50 Gy were recruited. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive or not receive HBO. All patients received chlorhexidine mouthwash and antibiotics. For patients in the HBO arm, oxygen was administered in 30 daily dives at 100% oxygen to a pressure of 2.4 atmospheres absolute for 80 to 90 minutes. The primary outcome measure was the diagnosis of ORN 6 months after surgery, as determined by a blinded central review of clinical photographs and radiographs. The secondary endpoints included grade of ORN, ORN at other time points, acute symptoms, pain, and quality of life.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 144 patients were randomized, and data from 100 patients were analyzed for the primary endpoint. The incidence of ORN at 6 months was 6.4% and 5.7% for the HBO and control groups, respectively (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-8.92; P = 1). Patients in the hyperbaric arm had fewer acute symptoms but no significant differences in late pain or quality of life. Dropout was higher in the HBO arm, but the baseline characteristics of the groups that completed the trial were comparable between the 2 arms.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The low incidence of ORN makes recommending HBO for dental extractions or implant placement in the irradiated mandible unnecessary. These findings are in contrast with a recently published Cochrane review and previous trials reporting rates of ORN (non-HBO) of 14% to 30% and challenge a long-established standard of care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30851351/,2022-11-28 02:46:08 AM
"Effect of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation medication on the risk of tympanic barotrauma in hyperbaric oxygen treatment patients, and development of a predictive model","Adam E Howard, Peter Buzzacott, Ian C Gawthrope, Neil D Banham, Adam E Howard, Peter Buzzacott, Ian C Gawthrope, Neil D Banham",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      Middle ear barotrauma (MEBt) is a common side effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) and can result in pain, hearing loss, tinnitus and otorrhagia. The use of antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs is thought to increase the risk and severity of MEBt during HBOT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Single centre, retrospective observational cohort study of all patients treated with HBOT over a 4-year period (between 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2018) looking at the incidence of MEBt and the concurrent use of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant drugs. MEBt was assessed by direct otoscopy of the tympanic membrane post-HBOT and scored using the modified Teed classification. Multivariate modelling assessed the relationship between antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation drug use, age, sex, and MEBt during HBOT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was no evidence that antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation drugs increase the risk of tympanic barotrauma in HBOT patients. The prevalence of MEBt was higher in female patients than in males (χ2 P = 0.004), and increased with age (χ2 P = 0.048). No MEBt was recorded in patients undergoing recompression therapy for decompression sickness or cerebral arterial gas embolism.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this retrospective single-centre study, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation drugs did not affect the risk of MEBt, but both age and sex did, with greater prevalence of MEBt among older patients and females compared with younger patients and males. A predictive model, requiring further validation, may be helpful in assessing the likelihood of MEBt in patients undergoing HBOT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325013/,2022-11-28 02:46:08 AM

We aimed to compare brachial and central blood pressures between veterans with PTSD and controls. Method In this case-control study on veterans of Iran-Iraq war, 50 veterans with PTSD and 50 veterans as controls were selected from an outpatient clinic and matched for age ±3 years. Exclusion criteria were malignancies, severe anatomical defects such as amputated extremities, history of PTSD before serving in war, comorbid psychiatric disorders other than anxiety or depressive disorders. Detailed history was taken concerning medical and social aspects. Beck Depression Inventory was used for depressive symptoms. Brachial blood pressures were measured using both auscultatory and oscillometric devices. Measures of central hemodynamics were estimated accordingly. Data on lipid profile were collected either through medical records or newly required lab tests. Results Brachial systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures as well as estimated central systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly higher in the PTSD group. Beck Depression Inventory scores, frequency of diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were significantly higher in the PTSD group. PTSD status was an independent predictor of both brachial and central systolic and diastolic pressures.

Pharmacological activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway with a Smoothened small molecule agonist ameliorates the severity of alcohol-induced morphological and behavioral birth defects in a zebrafish model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,"Derek F Burton, Oswald M Boa-Amponsem, Maria S Dixon, Michael J Hopkins, Te-Andre Herbin, Shiquita Toney, Michael Tarpley, Blanca V Rodriguez, Eric W Fish, Scott E Parnell, Gregory J Cole, Kevin P Williams, Derek F Burton, Oswald M Boa-Amponsem, Maria S Dixon, Michael J Hopkins, Te-Andre Herbin, Shiquita Toney, Michael Tarpley, Blanca V Rodriguez, Eric W Fish, Scott E Parnell, Gregory J Cole, Kevin P Williams",2022 Aug,"Ethanol exposure during the early stages of embryonic development can lead to a range of morphological and behavioral differences termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In a zebrafish model, we have shown that acute ethanol exposure at 8-10 hr postfertilization (hpf), a critical time of development, produces birth defects similar to those clinically characterized in FASD. Dysregulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway has been implicated as a molecular basis for many of the birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. We observed in zebrafish embryos that shh expression was significantly decreased by ethanol exposure at 8-10 hpf, while smo expression was much less affected. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with SAG or purmorphamine, small molecule Smoothened agonists that activate Shh signaling, ameliorated the severity of ethanol-induced developmental malformations including altered eye size and midline brain development. Furthermore, this rescue effect of Smo activation was dose dependent and occurred primarily when treatment was given after ethanol exposure. Markers of Shh signaling (gli1/2) and eye development (pax6a) were restored in embryos treated with SAG post-ethanol exposure. Since embryonic ethanol exposure has been shown to produce later-life neurobehavioral impairments, juvenile zebrafish were examined in the novel tank diving test. Our results further demonstrated that in zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol, SAG treatment was able to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental impairments related to anxiety and risk-taking behavior. Our results indicate that pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway at specific developmental timing markedly diminishes the severity of alcohol-induced birth defects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35014067/,2022-11-28 02:46:10 AM
Efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen treatment in SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pneumonia: a systematic review,"Sylvain Boet, Cole Etherington, George Djaiani, Andrea C Tricco, Lindsey Sikora, Rita Katznelson, Sylvain Boet, Cole Etherington, George Djaiani, Andrea C Tricco, Lindsey Sikora, Rita Katznelson",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The need for intubation and mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 patients is associated with high mortality rates and places a substantial burden on the healthcare system. There is a strong pathophysiological rationale suggesting that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), a low-risk and non-invasive treatment, may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aimed to explore the potential effectiveness and safety of HBOT for treating patients with COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from December 2019 to February 2021, without language restrictions. The grey literature was searched via an internet search engine and targeted website and database searches. Reference lists of included studies were searched. Independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Data were summarised descriptively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Six publications (one cohort study, five case reports/series) met the inclusion criteria with a total of 37 hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients treated with HBOT. Of these 37 patients, the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation and in-hospital survival were assessed for 26 patients across three studies. Of these 26 patients, intubation and mechanical ventilation were not required for 24, and 23 patients survived. No serious adverse events of HBOT in COVID-19 patients were reported. No randomised trials have been published.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Limited and weak evidence from non-randomised studies including one propensity-matched cohort study suggests HBOT is safe and may be a promising intervention to optimise treatment and outcomes in hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients. Randomised controlled studies are urgently needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547778/,2022-11-28 02:46:11 AM

Anthropogenic Debris Ingestion by Avifauna in Eastern Australia,"Lauren Roman, Qamar A Schuyler, Britta Denise Hardesty, Kathy A Townsend, Lauren Roman, Qamar A Schuyler, Britta Denise Hardesty, Kathy A Townsend",2016 Aug 30,"Anthropogenic debris in the world's oceans and coastal environments is a pervasive global issue that has both direct and indirect impacts on avifauna. The number of bird species affected, the feeding ecologies associated with an increased risk of debris ingestion, and selectivity of ingested debris have yet to be investigated in most of Australia's coastal and marine birds. With this study we aim to address the paucity of data regarding marine debris ingestion in Australian coastal and marine bird species. We investigated which Australian bird groups ingest marine debris, and whether debris-ingesting groups exhibit selectivity associated with their taxonomy, habitat or foraging methods. Here we present the largest multispecies study of anthropogenic debris ingestion in Australasian avifauna to date. We necropsied and investigated the gastrointestinal contents of 378 birds across 61 species, collected dead across eastern Australia. These species represented nine taxonomic orders, five habitat groups and six feeding strategies. Among investigated species, thirty percent had ingested debris, though ingestion did not occur uniformly within the orders of birds surveyed. Debris ingestion was found to occur in orders Procellariiformes, Suliformes, Charadriiformes and Pelecaniformes, across all surveyed habitats, and among birds that foraged by surface feeding, pursuit diving and search-by-sight. Procellariiformes, birds in pelagic habitats, and surface feeding marine birds ingested debris with the greatest frequency. Among birds which were found to ingest marine debris, we investigated debris selectivity and found that marine birds were selective with respect to both type and colour of debris. Selectivity for type and colour of debris significantly correlated with taxonomic order, habitat and foraging strategy. This study highlights the significant impact of feeding ecology on debris ingestion among Australia's avifauna.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27574986/,2022-11-28 02:46:12 AM
Does the installation of blue Lights on train platforms shift suicide to another station?: Evidence from Japan,"Tetsuya Matsubayashi, Yasuyuki Sawada, Michiko Ueda, Tetsuya Matsubayashi, Yasuyuki Sawada, Michiko Ueda",2014 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Installing physical barriers at suicide hotspots is known as an effective strategy for suicide prevention. However, the effectiveness of physical barriers may be nullified by the substitution phenomenon, i.e., that restricting access to a particular place induces people at risk to look for a nearby place for suicide.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study tests whether the substitution phenomenon exists in the case of railway and metro suicides. We focused on the prevention effort by a Japanese railway company that installed blue light-emitting-diode (LED) lamps on railway platforms to prevent people from diving to a running train. Using panel data of 71 train stations between 2000 and 2013, we compared the number of suicides before and after the installation of the blue lights at 14 stations where the lights were installed and at neighboring five stations on the same railway line, using the number of suicides at all other stations without the intervention as a control group.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Our regression analysis shows that the introduction of blue lights decreased the number suicides by 74% (CI: 48-87%) at stations where the blue lights were installed, while it did not result in a systematic increase in the number of suicides at the neighboring stations.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The installation of blue lights generated no systematic substitution phenomenon at nearby stations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25151192/,2022-11-28 02:46:13 AM
Intra-Atrial Right Coronary Artery and its Ablation Implications,"Balaji Krishnan, Caroline Cross, Richard Dykoski, David G Benditt, Mackenzie Mbai, Edward McFalls, Jian-Ming Li, Stefan Bertog, Venkatakrishna N Tholakanahalli, Balaji Krishnan, Caroline Cross, Richard Dykoski, David G Benditt, Mackenzie Mbai, Edward McFalls, Jian-Ming Li, Stefan Bertog, Venkatakrishna N Tholakanahalli",2017 Sep,"Objectives:
        
      
      The study examined the frequency in which a right coronary artery (RCA) anomaly resulting in intra-atrialization of the vessel might increase risk of RCA damage during routine radiofrequency ablation in the right atrium even with low power or temperature.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Right coronary artery (RCA) injury with endocardial RF ablation of the right atrium is a rare complication.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective observational study comprised an analysis of coronary artery anatomies in 331 patients who underwent autopsies at our institution from 2005 to 2014. The presence of intra-atrial RCA including the number and length of intra-atrial RCA segments with accompanying atherosclerosis and coronary anomalies were evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The authors report a case series of 6 of 331 (1.8%) patients in whom autopsies showed evidence of an intra-atrial RCA. The patients were all men (average 69 ± 12 years of age). They observed 3 variations of the intra-atrial RCA course. In 2 similar variations, the RCA entered the anterolateral aspect of the right atrium, returning to its normal distribution to supply the distal RCA (case 4 of 6) and the atrioventricular nodal artery (case 1 of 6). In the sixth case, the atrialized artery was an anterior branch of the RCA, in which the artery similarly coursed across the pectinate muscles, extending to the region of the anterior crista terminalis, before diving into the muscle.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prevalence and variants of the intra-atrial RCA have not been reported before. In the presence of an intra-atrial artery, RCA damage may occur due to direct injury rather than collateral injury due to transmural extension of an ablation lesion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29759708/,2022-11-28 02:46:14 AM
Teen Advisory Council Survey's Factors Associated With Self-Harming Thoughts,"Pamela McPherson, Laura Lane Alderman, Jazzlynn Temple, Robert Lawrence, Victor J Avila-Quintero, Johnette Magner, Caroline E Sagrera, James C Patterson, Kevin S Murnane, Pamela McPherson, Laura Lane Alderman, Jazzlynn Temple, Robert Lawrence, Victor J Avila-Quintero, Johnette Magner, Caroline E Sagrera, James C Patterson, Kevin S Murnane",2022 Jun 23,"Background:
        
      
      The evaluation of teens with self-harming thoughts (SHT) is a high-stakes task for physicians in community and emergency department (ED) settings. The lived experience of adolescents with stress and SHT provides an important source of insight for mental health professionals who evaluate and treat teens A snapshot of the lived experience of teens in northwest Louisiana was captured by the Step Forward Teen Advisory Council (TAC) in 2019. The TAC surveyed peers with the goal of identifying common stressors experienced by local teens in order to inform policy and practices in the local school system. The identification of stressors is a critical step in addressing SHT as adolescents who experience life stressors are at increased risk for self-harming thoughts (SHT), a known precursor to self-harm and suicide. Assessing youth for life stressors is a critical element of suicide prevention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Local teens queried 5,070 peers attending Caddo Parish schools to better understand the stressors faced by high school students in Northwest Louisiana using a student developed survey. Results were presented to peers at a virtual summit where teens developed action items to reduce stress and presented findings to local leaders. Their efforts ultimately lead to increased supports for students in local schools.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over half of the teens surveyed reported stressors that negatively impacted their physical or emotional well-being. Students endorsing self-harming thoughts reported an average of 7.82 stressors as compared to 3.47 in peers without SHT. Teens with stressors at both home and school were more likely to experience SHT than teens with stressors in a single location.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The Gen Z students who developed the TAC Survey identified stress as a major concern for teens in Northwest Louisiana. The TAC Survey data aligns local experience with established data regarding the association between stress, depression and SHT. Second, the results highlight the importance of diving deep to identify all stressors when assessing the risk of self-harm. Finally, the lived experience of local teens with SHT provides critical information for professionals to better understand risk for SHT and suicide in our region and beyond.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815025/,2022-11-28 02:46:14 AM
Breathalysing and surveying river users in Australia to understand alcohol consumption and attitudes toward drowning risk,"Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat, Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat",2018 Dec 19,"Background:
        
      
      Little is known about people's river usage, a leading drowning location. This study examines alcohol consumption patterns of river users and their attitudes to drowning risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A convenience sample of adult (18+ years) river users were surveyed at four river locations. The survey covered eight domains: demographics; river attendance frequency; frequency of engaging in water activities; drinking patterns; alcohol and water safety knowledge; alcohol and water safety attitudes; alcohol consumption; and Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). For BAC, participants were asked to record time since their last alcoholic drink and were then breathalysed to record an estimate of their BAC. BAC was examined by BAC reading (negative, positive, ≥0.050%). Hazardous lifetime drinking levels were calculated and their impact on drowning risk evaluated. Univariate and chi square analysis (95% confidence interval) was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Six hundred eighty four people participated (51.6% female; 49.0% aged 18-34 years). Sixteen percent (15.9%) had a positive BAC (Mean + BAC = 0.068%; SD ± 0.08; Range = 0.001-0.334%), with 7.2% ≥0.050% (Mean BAC ≥0.050% =0.132%; SD ± 0.06). Those significantly more likely to record a BAC ≥0.050% at the river were: aged 18-34 years, resided in inner regional and low socio-economic areas, visited the river in the afternoon, with friends, on days with higher maximum air temperatures, frequent river users (11+ times in the last 30 days) and those who spend longer in the water (301+ minutes). River users who recorded a BAC ≥0.050% were more likely to self-report engaging in risky activities (i.e. diving into water of unknown depth and jumping into the river from height). River users on Australia day (a national public holiday) were significantly more likely to drink heavily (Mean BAC ≥0.05% = 0.175%; SD ± 0.09).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite males accounting for 85% of alcohol-related river drowning deaths, similar numbers of males and females were consuming alcohol at the river. This study has addressed a gap in knowledge by identifying river usage and alcohol consumption patterns among those at increased drowning risk. Implications for prevention include delivering alcohol-related river drowning prevention strategies to both males and females; at peak times including during hot weather, afternoons, public holidays and to river users who swim.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30567588/,2022-11-28 02:46:15 AM

While for patients with bone marrow failure the treatment follows that of immune-mediated aplastic anaemia, that of classic, haemolytic PNH is based on anti-complement medication. The anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab has revolutionized treatment, resulting in control of intravascular haemolysis and thromboembolic risk, with improved long-term survival. Novel strategies of complement inhibition are emerging. New anti-C5 agents reproduce the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, with improved patient convenience.

Bold zebrafish (Danio rerio) express higher levels of delta opioid and dopamine D2 receptors in the brain compared to shy fish,"Per-Ove Thörnqvist, Sarah McCarrick, Maja Ericsson, Erika Roman, Svante Winberg, Per-Ove Thörnqvist, Sarah McCarrick, Maja Ericsson, Erika Roman, Svante Winberg",2019 Feb 1,"Individual variation in coping with environmental challenges is a well-known phenomenon across vertebrates, including teleost fish. Dopamine is the major transmitter in the brain reward networks, and important for motivational processes and stress coping. Functions of the endogenous opioid system are not well studied in teleosts. However, in mammals the activity in the brain reward networks is regulated by the endogenous opioid system. This study aimed at investigating if there was a correlation between risk-taking behavior and the expression of dopamine and opioid receptors in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain. Risk-taking behavior was assessed in a novel tank diving test, and the most extreme high risk taking, i.e. bold, and low risk taking, i.e. shy, fish were sampled for qPCR analysis of whole brain gene expression. The expression analysis showed a significantly higher expression of the dopamine D2 receptors (drd2a and drd2b) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR; oprd1b) in bold compared to shy fish. Besides reward and reinforcing properties, DORs are also involved in emotional responses. Dopamine D2 receptors are believed to be important for active stress coping in rodents, and taken together the results of the current study suggest similar functions in zebrafish. However, additional experiments are required to clarify how dopamine and opioid receptor activation affect behavior and stress coping in this species.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29935279/,2022-11-28 02:46:16 AM
Thermoregulatory and Metabolic Demands of Naval Special Warfare Divers During a 6-h Cold-Water Training Dive,"Andrea C Chapin, Laura J Arrington, Jake R Bernards, Karen R Kelly, Andrea C Chapin, Laura J Arrington, Jake R Bernards, Karen R Kelly",2021 Sep 29,"Introduction: Extreme environmental conditions induce changes in metabolic rate and substrate use due to thermoregulation. Cold-water full-body submersion for extended periods of time is inevitable for training and missions carried out by Naval Special Warfare divers. Anthropometric, physiologic, and metabolic data have been reported from partial immersion in cold water in non-thermally protected men; data is limited in thermally protected divers in extremely cold water. Thermoregulatory and metabolic demands during prolonged cold-water submersion in Naval Special Warfare divers are unknown. Objective: Assess thermoregulatory and metabolic demands of Naval Special Warfare divers surrounding prolonged cold-water submersion. Materials and Methods: Sixteen active-duty U.S. Navy Sea Air and Land (SEAL) operators tasked with cold-water dive training participated. Divers donned standard military special operations diving equipment and fully submerged to a depth of ∼ 6 m in a pool chilled to 5°C for a 6-h live training exercise. Metabolic measurements were obtained via indirect calorimetry for 10-min pre-dive and 5-min post dive. Heart rate, skin temperature, and core temperature were measured throughout the dive. Results: Core temperature was maintained at the end of the 6-h dive, 36.8 ± 0.4°C and was not correlated to body composition (body fat percentage, lean body mass) or metabolic rate. SEALs were not at risk for non-freezing cold injuries as mean skin temperature was 28.5 ± 1.6°C at end of the 6-h dive. Metabolic rate (kcal/min) was different pre- to post-dive, increasing from 1.9 ± 0.2 kcal/min to 2.8 ± 0.2 kcal/min, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.8, 1.3], Cohen's d effect size 2.3. Post-dive substrate utilization was 57.5% carbohydrate, 0.40 ± 0.16 g/min, and 42.5% fat, 0.13 ± 0.04 g/min. Conclusion: Wetsuits supported effective thermoprotection in conjunction with increase in thermogenesis during a 6-h full submersion dive in 5°C. Core temperature was preserved with an expected decrease in skin temperature. Sustained cold-water diving resulted in a 53% increase in energy expenditure. While all participants increased thermogenesis, there was high inter-individual variability in metabolic rate and substrate utilization. Variability in metabolic demands may be attributable to individual physiologic adjustments due to prior cold exposure patterns of divers. This suggests that variations in metabolic adjustments and habituation to the cold were likely. More work is needed to fully understand inter-individual metabolic variability to prolonged cold-water submersion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34658902/,2022-11-28 02:46:17 AM
"[Patent foramen ovele, good reasons to close it]","Bernhard Meier, Bernhard Meier",2018 Mar,"A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is not to be considered a disease as it is present in about 25 % of people. Yet, it is the prime reason for paradoxical embolism that can cause serious problems, such as death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral ischemia. The frequency of such events is probably underestimated as other causes tend to be blamed for them. Device PFO closure can be easily accomplished as outpatient procedure with minimal discomfort and risk and it has been referred to as mechanical vaccination. Randomized trials have proved its value for reduction of recurrent stroke. There is also good evidence that PFO closure solves problems like platypnoea orthodeoxia and exercise desaturation, improves migraine, and is helpful in sleep apnoea. In addition, it renders diving and high altitude climbing safer. The absolute risk of a PFO is dependent on its size and its association with an atrial septal aneurysm, a Eustachian valve, or a Chiari network.

"Effects of whale-based tourism in Vava'u, Kingdom of Tonga: Behavioural responses of humpback whales to vessel and swimming tourism activities","Lorenzo Fiori, Emmanuelle Martinez, Mark B Orams, Barbara Bollard, Lorenzo Fiori, Emmanuelle Martinez, Mark B Orams, Barbara Bollard",2019 Jul 5,"Vava'u, Kingdom of Tonga, is a well-established whale-watching destination in the South Pacific. Between July and October, the waters around the archipelago represent one of the most important breeding grounds for Oceania humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The Tongan government allows tourist swimming activities with whales and tour operators strongly promote the practice of swimming-with-whales, focusing primarily on mother-calf pairs. However, there is increasing evidence, derived from empirical research on swim-with-cetacean tourism, that this kind of interaction affects cetacean behaviour and can lead to negative effects on the cetaceans involved. This study represents the first assessment of humpback whales' behavioural responses to vessel and swimmer approaches in Vava'u. Fifty-six surveys took place during the 2016 and 2017 whale breeding seasons aboard dedicated research and tour vessels. Whale dive time, number of reorientation events, and respiration rates were documented in both the absence and presence of boats and swimmers. Vessel approach type, swimmer placement, and whale avoidance responses were also recorded. Results indicate that the average diving time and the proportion of time spent diving in the presence of swimming activities increased significantly for mother-calf pairs (F2,36 = 18.183, P < 0.001; F2,36 = 5.462, P = 0.009, respectively). Moreover, avoidance responses of whales towards tour vessels were observed for one third of vessel approaches (33.5%) and the avoidance rate was significantly affected by the boat approach type (95% CI: 20.7-69.2%, z = 3.50, P < 0.001). Finally, low levels of compliance to the existing Tongan swim-with-whales regulations were documented, in particular the stipulated whale resting time between interactions with tour operator vessels and swimmers was often not respected (38.4%). Vava'u is an important calving ground for the Oceania humpback whale population and these findings should be carefully considered by stakeholders in Tonga and at other locations where swim-with-whales opportunities are being undertaken. Effective strategies to reduce the risk of detrimental effects on the whales targeted by swimming activities, especially mother-calf pairs, are needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276544/,2022-11-28 02:46:19 AM
Jumping to (fatal) conclusions? An analysis of video film on a social networking web site of recreational jumping from height into water,"Kevin Moran, Kevin Moran",2014,"In high-income countries, death as a consequence of recreational jumping into water from height has not been well investigated partly because it traditionally has been a covert activity within youth culture. An observational study of video recordings posted on the YouTube web site was used to gather data on the nature of jumping activity in New Zealand and Australia. An analytical framework was developed to identify site- participant- social characteristics (10 variables) and online feedback (4 variables). Of the 389 videos recorded in New Zealand (n = 210) and Australia (n = 179), 929 jumpers were observed, and rivers were the most frequently reported site of jumping activity (New Zealand 47%; Australia 35%). One fifth (20%) of the jumps in New Zealand and one third (33%) in Australia were from heights estimated to be more than 12 m. The YouTube website portraying jumps from height were visited almost half a million times (495,686 hits). Ways of reducing recreational jumping risk via targeted education interventions may be best directed at young male adults.

Inflation and deflation pressure-volume loops in anesthetized pinnipeds confirms compliant chest and lungs,"Andreas Fahlman, Stephen H Loring, Shawn P Johnson, Martin Haulena, Andrew W Trites, Vanessa A Fravel, William G Van Bonn, Andreas Fahlman, Stephen H Loring, Shawn P Johnson, Martin Haulena, Andrew W Trites, Vanessa A Fravel, William G Van Bonn",2014 Nov 10,"We examined structural properties of the marine mammal respiratory system, and tested Scholander's hypothesis that the chest is highly compliant by measuring the mechanical properties of the respiratory system in five species of pinniped under anesthesia (Pacific harbor seal, Phoca vitulina; northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris; northern fur seal Callorhinus ursinus; California sea lion, Zalophus californianus; and Steller sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus). We found that the chest wall compliance (CCW) of all five species was greater than lung compliance (airways and alveoli, CL) as predicted by Scholander, which suggests that the chest provides little protection against alveolar collapse or lung squeeze. We also found that specific respiratory compliance was significantly greater in wild animals than in animals raised in an aquatic facility. While differences in ages between the two groups may affect this incidental finding, it is also possible that lung conditioning in free-living animals may increase pulmonary compliance and reduce the risk of lung squeeze during diving. Overall, our data indicate that compliance of excised pinniped lungs provide a good estimate of total respiratory compliance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25426080/,2022-11-28 02:46:20 AM
Foraging ecology drives social information reliance in an avian eavesdropping community,"Harrison H Jones, Kathryn E Sieving, Harrison H Jones, Kathryn E Sieving",2019 Sep 14,"Vertebrates obtain social information about predation risk by eavesdropping on the alarm calls of sympatric species. In the Holarctic, birds in the family Paridae function as sentinel species; however, factors shaping eavesdroppers' reliance on their alarm calls are unknown. We compared three hypothesized drivers of eavesdropper reliance: (a) foraging ecology, (b) degree of sociality, and (c) call relevance (caller-to-eavesdropper body-size difference). In a rigorous causal-comparative design, we presented Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) alarm calls to 242 individuals of 31 ecologically diverse bird species in Florida forests and recorded presence/absence and type (diving for cover or freezing in place) of response. Playback response was near universal, as individuals responded to 87% of presentations (N = 211). As an exception to this trend, the sit-and-wait flycatcher Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) represented 48% of the nonresponses. We tested 12 predictor variables representing measures relevant to the three hypothesized drivers, distance to playback speaker, and vulnerability at time of playback (eavesdropper's microhabitat when alarm call is detected). Using model-averaged generalized linear models, we determined that foraging ecology best predicted playback response, with aerial foragers responding less often. Foraging ecology (distance from trunk) and microhabitat occupied during playback (distance to escape cover) best predicted escape behavior type. We encountered a sparsity of sit-and-wait flycatchers (3 spp.), yet their contrasting responses relative to other foraging behaviors clearly identified foraging ecology as a driver of species-specific antipredator escape behavior. Our findings align well with known links between the exceptional visual acuity and other phenotypic traits of flycatchers that allow them to rely more heavily on personal rather than social information while foraging. Our results suggest that foraging ecology drives species-specific antipredator behavior based on the availability and type of escape cover.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31695870/,2022-11-28 02:46:21 AM
Can preventive hyperbaric oxygen therapy optimise surgical outcome?: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials,"Sylvain Boet, Leonardo Martin, Olivia Cheng-Boivin, Nicole Etherington, Pierre Louge, Rodrigue Pignel, Michel Pellégrini, Marie-Anne Magnan, Michael Bennett, Sylvain Boet, Leonardo Martin, Olivia Cheng-Boivin, Nicole Etherington, Pierre Louge, Rodrigue Pignel, Michel Pellégrini, Marie-Anne Magnan, Michael Bennett",2020 Aug,"Background:
        
      
      A primary underlying cause of postoperative complications is related to the surgical stress response, which may be mitigated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), the intermittent administration of oxygen at a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Promising clinical studies have emerged suggesting HBOT's efficacy for reducing some postoperative complications. Notwithstanding, the effectiveness (if any) of HBOT across a range of procedures and postoperative outcomes has yet to be clearly quantified.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This systematic review aimed to summarise the existing literature on peri-operative HBOT to investigate its potential to optimise surgical patient outcome.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with narrative summary of results.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched without language restrictions through to 19 June 2018.
    


          Eligibility criteria:
        
      
      Studies were included if they involved patients of any age undergoing any surgical procedure and provided with at least one HBOT session in the peri-operative period. Two independent reviewers screened the initial identified trials and determined those to be included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search retrieved 775 references, of which 13 RCTs were included (627 patients). Ten RCTs (546 patients) reported treatment was effective for improving at least one of the patient outcomes assessed, while two studies (55 patients) did not find any benefit and one study (26 patients) found a negative effect. A wide range of patient outcomes were reported, and several other methodological limitations were observed among the included studies, such as limited use of sham comparator and lack of blinding.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Peri-operative preventive HBOT may be a promising intervention to improve surgical patient outcome. However, future work should consider addressing the methodological weaknesses identified in this review.

In the present study, multiple lines of evidence, including site-specific effects data, were used to assess PCB-related risks to marine biota at a contaminated military site in Saglek Bay, Labrador, Canada, from 1997 to 1999. Risks were evaluated for three components of the ecosystem: benthic invertebrates, a bottom-feeding fish (shorthorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius), and a diving seabird (black guillemot, Cepphus grylle). Average sediment PCB concentrations exceeded the Canadian interim sediment quality guideline level by 41-fold. However, sediment toxicity testing and a benthic community survey showed no evidence of adverse effects. In contrast, shorthorn sculpin and black guillemot PCB exposures (measured as sum of 55 congeners) were elevated enough to pose risks to survival or reproduction. Based on the collective evidence, the authors estimated that risks were posed by sediment PCB concentrations greater than 77 ng/g dry weight for black guillemots and 750 ng/g dry weight for shorthorn sculpins. The present study, along with two parallel studies, provided information to support the management decisions concerning potential remedial action on the contaminated sediments. This ecological risk assessment describes the steps and rationale taken to evaluate the risk posed by an area of PCB-contaminated marine sediments in an otherwise relatively pristine northern coastal environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23147987/,2022-11-28 02:46:23 AM
A Case of Scabies Presenting as Chronic Urticaria,"Imelda Muller, Alyson Brinker, Imelda Muller, Alyson Brinker",2020 Sep 18,"Scabies outbreaks are relatively common worldwide, particularly in communal living settings such as military barracks. The infestation is caused by the parasite Sarcoptes Scabiei and is easily treated once properly diagnosed. Classic symptoms include pruritus around the waist, wrists, and ankles.1 On physical examination, linear burrows visualized in finger web spaces is a typical finding.1 It is not uncommon, however, for scabies to present with a variety of other dermatologic manifestations, which can lead to a delayed or missed diagnosis. This case highlights a delayed diagnosis of scabies, initially presenting as urticaria in a 26-year-old active duty male living in military barracks where multiple previous outbreaks were identified. Providers should be aware of the oftentimes-elusive diagnosis of scabies and the many nonclassic dermatologic manifestations. A thorough skin examination with skin scrapings and examination of the finger web spaces should be considered in those with ambiguous skin rashes who are particularly at risk for scabies infection, such as military recruits, submariners, and other service members living in communal settings. Timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment is crucial to prevent reinfection and spread of scabies throughout these communal living settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32343346/,2022-11-28 02:46:23 AM

The role of routine pulmonary imaging before hyperbaric oxygen treatment,"Connor Ta Brenna, Shawn Khan, George Djaiani, Jay C Buckey Jr, Rita Katznelson, Connor Ta Brenna, Shawn Khan, George Djaiani, Jay C Buckey Jr, Rita Katznelson",2022 Sep 30,"Respiratory injury during or following hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) is rare, but associated pressure changes can cause iatrogenic pulmonary barotrauma with potentially severe sequelae such as pneumothoraces. Pulmonary blebs, bullae, and other emphysematous airspace abnormalities increase the risk of respiratory complications and are prevalent in otherwise healthy adults. HBOT providers may elect to use chest X-ray routinely as a pre-treatment screening tool to identify these anomalies, particularly if a history of preceding pulmonary disease is identified, but this approach has a low sensitivity and frequently provides false negative results. Computed tomography scans offer greater sensitivity for airspace lesions, but given the high prevalence of incidental and insignificant pulmonary findings among healthy individuals, would lead to a high false positive rate because most lesions are unlikely to pose a hazard during HBOT. Post-mortem and imaging studies of airspace lesion prevalence show that a significant proportion of patients who undergo HBOT likely have pulmonary abnormalities such as blebs and bullae. Nevertheless, pulmonary barotrauma is rare, and occurs mainly in those with known underlying lung pathology. Consequently, routinely using chest X-ray or computed tomography scans as screening tools prior to HBOT for low-risk patients without a pertinent medical history or lack of clinical symptoms of cardiorespiratory disease is of low value. This review outlines published cases of patients experiencing pulmonary barotrauma while undergoing pressurised treatment/testing in a hyperbaric chamber and analyses the relationship between barotrauma and pulmonary findings on imaging prior to or following exposure. A checklist and clinical decision-making tool based on suggested low-risk and high-risk features are offered to guide the use of targeted baseline thoracic imaging prior to HBOT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36100931/,2022-11-28 02:46:25 AM
The effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on late radiation tissue injury after breast cancer: A case-series of 67 patients,"Nicole E Spruijt, Roy van den Berg, Nicole E Spruijt, Roy van den Berg",2020 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Late radiation tissue injury (LRTI) after breast cancer may benefit from hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). This study aimed to report the LRTI symptom scores up to 12 months after HBOT and identify risk factors for poor scores.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A case-series of 67 patients who underwent a mean of 44 sessions of HBOT was analysed. LRTI symptoms were scored at four time points using the LENT-SOMA scale (Late Effects in Normal Tissues - Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic), a visual analog scale for pain, and the range of shoulder motion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between starting HBOT and 12 months after HBOT 57 patients (85%) reported at least one point improvement in their LENT-SOMA score. Median pain and fibrosis scores improved significantly between the start and end of HBOT (P < 0.001), and remained stable three and 12 months after HBOT. The median breast oedema score improved significantly 12 months after HBOT (P = 0.003). Median shoulder abduction increased significantly from 90 to 165 degrees (P = 0.001) and median shoulder anteflexion increased significantly from 115 to 150 degrees (P = 0.004). Various risk factors were identified for poor scores despite HBOT; the most common risk factor was a poor score at start of HBOT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this case-series, patients who underwent HBOT for LRTI after breast cancer reported significant improvement in pain, fibrosis, oedema, and shoulder movement. The improvement persisted up to 12 months after HBOT. A poor score at the start of HBOT was predictive for a poor score 12 months after HBOT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957121/,2022-11-28 02:46:25 AM
Targeted and untargeted metabolomics applied to occupational exposure to hyperbaric atmosphere,"Giovanna Tranfo, Enrico Marchetti, Daniela Pigini, Alfredo Miccheli, Mariangela Spagnoli, Fabio Sciubba, Giorgia Conta, Alberta Tomassini, Luigi Fattorini, Giovanna Tranfo, Enrico Marchetti, Daniela Pigini, Alfredo Miccheli, Mariangela Spagnoli, Fabio Sciubba, Giorgia Conta, Alberta Tomassini, Luigi Fattorini",2020 Aug 1,"Occupational exposure to hyperbaric atmosphere occurs in workers who carry out their activity in environments where breathing air pressure is at least 10% higher than pressure at sea level, and operations can be divided in Dry or Wet activities. The increased air pressure implies the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), consumption of antioxidants and reduction of antioxidant enzyme activity, causing lipid peroxidation, DNA and RNA damage. The present study was aimed to establish the relation between hyperbaric exposure and metabolic changes due to ROS unbalance, by means of the determination of urinary biomarkers of oxidatively generated damage to DNA and RNA during a controlled diving session. The investigated biomarkers were 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo), and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo). The experimental session involved six experienced divers subjected to 3 atmospheres absolute for 30 minutes in two different experiments, in both dry and wet conditions. Urine samples were collected at t = 0 (before exposure) and 30 (end of exposure),90, 240, 480 and 720 minutes. The concentration of 8-oxoGua, 8-oxoGuo, and 8-oxodGuo was determined by isotopic dilution high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-MS/MS). In all subjects there is an increase of the urinary excretion of 8oxo-Guo and 8oxo-dGuo, in both conditions, after 1.5 - 4 hours from the start of the experiment, and that the values tend to return to the baseline after 12 hours. Besides that, also the nucleic magnetic resonance (NMR)-based untargeted metabolomics was employed for the same objective on the same samples, confirming a different metabolic response in the subjects exposed to dry or wet conditions. In particular, the observed hypoxanthine urinary level increases during the underwater hyperbaric exposure, in agreement with the trend observed for 8-oxoGuo and 8-oxodGuo levels. Present results confirmed the relationship between exposure and oxidative stress and depicted a clear temporal trend of the investigated biomarkers. Due to the possible negative consequences of oxidative stress on workers, present research shows a new line in term of risk prevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305374/,2022-11-28 02:46:26 AM

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT), including seizures in patients breathing oxygen at pressures ≥ 2 atmospheres absolute. This study aimed to determine the seizure frequency and assess the clinical benefit of a 5-minute air-break (5´-AIRBK).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-year (1999-2018) retrospective analysis of all consecutive treatments with HBOT. Medical records were reviewed to determine patient demographics, comorbidities, HBOT indications, and seizure characteristics and timing. Seizure frequency was compared before and after incorporating a 5´-AIRBK in the treatment protocol. Chi-square testing was performed using SPSS (version 24.0); P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We evaluated 188,335 HBOT sessions (74,255 before versus 114,080 after introducing a 5´-AIRBK). A total of 43 seizures were observed: 29 before and 14 after the 5´-AIRBK introduction (3.9 versus 1.2 per 10,000 treatments; P < 0.0001). Seizures occurred after a median of 57 (range 15-85) minutes following compression and after a median of 21 HBOT sessions (1-126). Patients experiencing seizures were undergoing treatment for: diabetic ulcer (n = 11); acute traumatic peripheral ischaemia (ATPI) (n = 6); non-diabetic ulcer (n = 5); sudden sensorineural hearing loss (n = 5); chronic refractory osteomyelitis (n = 5); radionecrosis (n = 3); necrotising fasciitis (NF) (n = 2); and haemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (n = 1). ATPI and NF had a considerably higher relative frequency of seizures compared to other indications.

Methods: Eighty male SD rats were randomly divided into blank control group, escape control group and six intervention groups (escape at 4 hours after 4 Gy radiation, escape at 4 hours after 6 Gy radiation, escape at 4 hours after 12 Gy radiation, escape at 8 hours after 4 Gy radiation, escape at 8 hours after 6 Gy radiation, escape at 8 hours after 12 Gy radiation). Rats in intervention groups were exposed to different doses of γ-ray (4,6,12 Gy, respectively), and then were carried out a large depth and rapid buoyancy escape experiment (maximum pressure depth of 150 m). The changes of lung W/D, spleen index and plasma IL-1β levels were analyzed. Results: Compared with the blank control group, decompression sickness incidence and mortality of rats in escape groups after nuclear exposure were increased significantly. In 4 Gy and 6 Gy irradiation groups, higher morbidity and mortality were observed in rats which escaped at 4 h post nuclear exposure when compared with rats in 8 h groups. Consistent with the changes in morbidity and mortality, the wet / dry ratio of lung tissue, the pathological damage of lung tissue, and the decrease of spleen index showed the same trends: the changes were obvious at 4 h after lower doses nuclear radiation (4 Gy and 6 Gy), not at 8 h. However, these indicators all changed markedly at 4 and 8 h after higher doses nuclear radiation (12 Gy). Plasma IL-1β levels were significantly increased in each post-radiation exposure group when compared with the blank control group and the exposed control group.

Adult exposure to insecticides causes persistent behavioral and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish,"Andrew B Hawkey, Lilah Glazer, Cassandra Dean, Corinne N Wells, Kathryn-Ann Odamah, Theodore A Slotkin, Frederic J Seidler, Edward D Levin, Andrew B Hawkey, Lilah Glazer, Cassandra Dean, Corinne N Wells, Kathryn-Ann Odamah, Theodore A Slotkin, Frederic J Seidler, Edward D Levin",2020 Mar-Apr,"Farmers are often chronically exposed to insecticides, which may present health risks including increased risk of neurobehavioral impairment during adulthood and across aging. Experimental animal studies complement epidemiological studies to help determine the cause-and-effect relationship between chronic adult insecticide exposure and behavioral dysfunction. With the zebrafish model, we examined short and long-term neurobehavioral effects of exposure to either an organochlorine insecticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or an organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). Adult fish were exposed continuously for either two or 5 weeks (10-30 nM DDT, 0.3-3 μM CPF), with short- and long-term effects assessed at 1-week post-exposure and at 14 months of age respectively. The behavioral test battery included tests of locomotor activity, tap startle, social behavior, anxiety, predator avoidance and learning. Long-term effects on neurochemical indices of cholinergic function were also assessed. Two weeks of DDT exposure had only slight effects on locomotor activity, while a longer five-week exposure led to hypoactivity and increased anxiety-like diving responses and predator avoidance at 1-week post-exposure. When tested at 14 months of age, these fish showed hypoactivity and increased startle responses. Cholinergic function was not found to be significantly altered by DDT. The two-week CPF exposure led to reductions in anxiety-like diving and increases in shoaling responses at the 1-week time point, but these effects did not persist through 14 months of age. Nevertheless, there were persistent decrements in cholinergic presynaptic activity. A five-week CPF exposure led to long-term effects including locomotor hyperactivity and impaired predator avoidance at 14 months of age, although no effects were apparent at the 1-week time point. These studies documented neurobehavioral effects of adult exposure to chronic doses of either organochlorine or organophosphate pesticides that can be characterized in zebrafish. Zebrafish provide a low-cost model that has a variety of advantages for mechanistic studies and may be used to expand our understanding of neurobehavioral toxicity in adulthood, including the potential for such toxicity to influence behavior and development during aging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31911208/,2022-11-28 02:46:29 AM

We investigated responses of long-finned pilot whales to killer whale sound playbacks and two anthropogenic sources of disturbance: tagging effort and naval sonar exposure. The acoustic scene and diving behaviour of tagged individuals were recorded along with the social behaviour of their groups. All three disturbance types resulted in larger group sizes, increasing social cohesion during disturbance. However, the nature and magnitude of other responses differed between disturbance types. Tagging effort resulted in a clear increase in synchrony and a tendency to reduce surface logging and to become silent (21% of cases), whereas pilot whales increased surface resting during sonar exposure. Killer whale sounds elicited increased calling rates and the aggregation of multiple groups, which approached the sound source together. This behaviour appears to represent a mobbing response, a likely adaptive social defence against predators or competitors. All observed response-tactics would reduce risk of loss of group coordination, suggesting that, in social pilot whales, this could drive behavioural responses to disturbance. However, the behavioural means used to achieve social coordination depends upon other considerations, which are disturbance-specific.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27353529/,2022-11-28 02:46:30 AM

FUNCTIONAL HOP TESTS AND TUCK JUMP ASSESSMENT SCORES BETWEEN FEMALE DIVISION I COLLEGIATE ATHLETES PARTICIPATING IN HIGH VERSUS LOW ACL INJURY PRONE SPORTS: A CROSS SECTIONAL ANALYSIS,"Philipp Hoog, Meghan Warren, Craig A Smith, Nicole J Chimera, Philipp Hoog, Meghan Warren, Craig A Smith, Nicole J Chimera",2016 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Although functional tests including the single leg hop (SLH), triple hop (TH), cross over hop (COH) for distance, and the tuck jump assessment (TJA) are used for return to play (RTP) criteria for post anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, sport-specific baseline measurements are limited.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to examine differences in SLH, TH, and COH distance and limb symmetry index (LSI), as well as total scores, number of jumps, and individual flaws of the TJA in 97 injury-free Division I (DI) collegiate female student athletes participating in ACL injury prone vs. non ACL injury prone sports. The hypothesis was that significant mean differences and asymmetries (LSI) would exist between the two groups in SLH, TH, COH and TJA.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Cross sectional.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Due to research suggesting inherent ACL injury risk associated with specific sport involvement, participants were grouped into high (HR, n=57) and low (LR, n=40) ACL injury risk based on participating in a sport with high or low ACL injury rates. The HR group was composed of athletes participating in soccer, basketball, and volleyball, while the LR group athletes participated in diving, cross country, and track and field. Participants performed all standard functional tests (SFT) and side-to-side differences for each participant as well as between group differences were assessed for the hop tests. The LSI, a ratio frequently used to gauge athletes' readiness for RTP post injury, was also assessed for between group differences. The TJA was compared between the groups on individual flaws, overall scores, and number of jumps performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No between group differences for hop distances were found, with medium to large effect sizes for SLH, TH, and COH. The HR group had a higher TJA score, number of jumps, and higher proportion of the flaw of 'foot placement not shoulder width apart'.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although most SFT's showed no significant differences between athlete groups, some differences were seen in the TJA; the HR group showed an increase in 'foot placement not shoulder width apart' flaw, higher overall flaw scores, and overall jumped more times compared to the LR group. These results may warrant caution in relying solely on SFT for RTP decisions, due to potential asymmetries seen in an uninjured population with baseline testing.

      Of 239 athletes, 61 (25.5%) were classified into moderate-risk and 9 (3.8%) into high-risk categories. Sports with the highest proportion of athletes assigned to the moderate- and high-risk categories included gymnastics (56.3%), lacrosse (50%), cross-country (48.9%), swimming/diving (42.9%), sailing (33%), and volleyball (33%). Twenty-five athletes (10.5%) assigned to risk categories sustained ≥1 BSI. Cross-country runners contributed the majority of BSIs (16; 64%). After adjusting for age and participation in cross-country, we found that moderate-risk athletes were twice as likely as low-risk athletes to sustain a BSI (risk ratio [RR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-5.5) and high-risk athletes were nearly 4 times as likely (RR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.8-8.0). When examining the 6 individual components of the triad risk assessment score, both the oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea score ( P = .0069) and the prior stress fracture/reaction score ( P = .0315) were identified as independent predictors for subsequent BSIs (after adjusting for cross-country participation and age).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Using published guidelines, 29% of female collegiate athletes in this study were classified into moderate- or high-risk categories using the Female Athlete Triad Cumulative Risk Assessment Score. Moderate- and high-risk athletes were more likely to subsequently sustain a BSI; most BSIs were sustained by cross-country runners.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28038316/,2022-11-28 02:46:32 AM
Impact of Co-Culture on the Metabolism of Marine Microorganisms,"Flore Caudal, Nathalie Tapissier-Bontemps, Ru Angelie Edrada-Ebel, Flore Caudal, Nathalie Tapissier-Bontemps, Ru Angelie Edrada-Ebel",2022 Feb 21,"Natural products from plants have been listed for hundreds of years as a source of biologically active molecules. In recent years, the marine environment has demonstrated its ability to provide new structural entities. More than 70% of our planet's surface is covered by oceans, and with the technical advances in diving and remotely operated vehicles, it is becoming easier to collect samples. Although the risk of rediscovery is significant, the discovery of silent gene clusters and innovative analytical techniques has renewed interest in natural product research. Different strategies have been proposed to activate these silent genes, including co-culture, or mixed fermentation, a cultivation-based approach.

Risky business: a 15-year analysis of fatal coastal drowning of young male adults in Australia,"Jasmin C Lawes, Annabel Ellis, Shane Daw, Luke Strasiotto, Jasmin C Lawes, Annabel Ellis, Shane Daw, Luke Strasiotto",2021 Oct,"Introduction:
        
      
      Drowning is a leading cause of unintentional death, especially for males. In Australian coastal waters, young male adults account for 25% of the burden of male drowning. This study aims to describe young male coastal drowning deaths and to examine the prevalence of risk factors, especially alcohol and drugs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Characteristics of unintentional fatal drowning involving males (15-34 years) were compared with other adults (15 years and older). Data were sourced from the National Coronial Information System (Australia) and Surf Life Saving incident reports (2004/2005-2018/2019). Relative risk was calculated and χ2 tests of independence were performed (p<0.05). Blood alcohol and drug concentrations were analysed with permutational analyses of variance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Young males drowned more while jumping (9.85 times), swimming/wading (1.41 times), at rock/cliff locations (1.42 times) and on public holidays (1.8 times). Young males drowned less while boating (0.81 times), scuba diving (2.08 times), offshore (1.56 times) or due to medical factors (3.7 times). Young males drowned more (1.68 times) after consuming illicit drugs (amphetamines 2.26 times; cannabis 2.25 times) and less with prescription drugs (benzodiazepines 2.6 times; opiates 4.1 times; antidepressants 7.7 times). Blood serum concentrations of cannabis were higher in young males, while amphetamine and alcohol were lower.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Unsafe behaviours alongside certain activities or locations create deadly combinations of risk factors. A relationship between age, activity, attitude and affluence is proposed, where young males drown more in affordable activities with fewer regulations. Our results support multilevel strategies (spanning life stages) to reduce young male coastal drowning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33239312/,2022-11-28 02:46:34 AM
Cervical Spine Injuries in Children Associated With Sports and Recreational Activities,"Lynn Babcock, Cody S Olsen, David M Jaffe, Julie C Leonard, Cervical Spine Study Group for the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), Lynn Babcock, Cody S Olsen, David M Jaffe, Julie C Leonard, Cervical Spine Study Group for the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN)",2018 Oct,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to ascertain potential factors associated with cervical spine injuries in children injured during sports and recreational activities.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter retrospective case-control study involving children younger than 16 years who presented to emergency departments after blunt trauma and underwent cervical spine radiography. Cases had cervical spine injury from sports or recreational activities (n = 179). Comparison groups sustained (1) cervical spine injury from other mechanisms (n = 361) or (2) other injuries from sports and recreational activities but were free of cervical spine injury (n = 180).
    


          Results:
        
      
      For children with sport and recreational activity-related cervical spine injuries, common injury patterns were subaxial (49%) and fractures (56%). These children were at increased odds of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormalities compared with children with cervical spine injuries from other mechanisms (25% vs 6%). Children with sport and recreational activity-related trauma had increased odds of cervical spine injury if they had focal neurologic findings (odds ratio [OR], 5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-9.4), had complaints of neck pain (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9-5.0), were injured diving (OR, 43.5; 95% CI, 5.9-321.3), or sustained axial loading impacts (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.5). Football (22%), diving (20%), and bicycle crashes (11%) were the leading activities associated with cervical spine injury.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In children injured during sports and recreational activities, focal neurologic findings, neck pain, axial loading impacts, and the possibility of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality should guide the diagnostic evaluation for potential cervical spine injuries. Certain activities have a considerable frequency of cervical spine injury, which may benefit from activity-specific preventive measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749628/,2022-11-28 02:46:34 AM
Diving In Water Recompression,"J R. Walker, III, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie, J R. Walker, III, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie",,"As any person ventures into an increased pressure environment, they begin to absorb the inert gasses in their breathing media in proportion to the percentage of each gas inspired (Dalton’s law). In the air, the bulk of the inert gas is nitrogen (approximately 78%), and the gas is absorbed based on the amount of increased pressure and the time the individual inspires the gas. Functionally, this can be seen underwater, in deep tunnel drilling, in caissons, or in other exotic increased pressure environments. It is most easily conceptualized in a diver descending underwater, so that model will be used for this explanation.
    

      
      Diving using an underwater breathing apparatus (UBA) of any type involves the inspiration of gas by the diver at ambient pressure, which is increased from normal surface pressure. Seawater is sufficiently denser than air that 1 atmosphere (atm) of air is equivalent to 33 feet of seawater (FSW), meaning the diver can double their ambient pressure by descending only 33 feet in the water column. As pressure increases, the amount of inert gas dissolved in the diver’s bloodstream and tissues also increases, which exponentially decreases the time the diver can remain at depth without taking time to off-gas (decompress) prior to returning to the surface. Divers who remain at depth past the no-decompression time limit for that specific depth are at increased risk of the dissolved inert gas in their bodies reaching a critical supersaturation point during their ascent and having gas bubbles form de novo either in the bloodstream or in tissues. These bubbles are often asymptomatic but can result in decompression sickness when the gas bubbles themselves do damage to the surrounding tissues.
    

      
      Because the amount of dissolved gas is related to the time as well as the ambient pressure increase, it is necessary to address both components. As depth increases, the probability of decompression sickness increases exponentially. A diver at 15 feet of saltwater, typically, can stay indefinitely with almost no chance of decompression sickness while a diver at 60 feet can only remain for about an hour before needing to stop and decompress prior to direct return to the surface. The same diver at 100 feet of saltwater would only have 25 minutes and only about 5 minutes at 150 feet. Once a diver remains beyond these limits, direct return to the surface would mean a statistically significant increase in the probability of decompression sickness via bubble formation in the bloodstream or tissues and must be mitigated with stops on the way back to the surface to provide the diver with the opportunity to breath out inert gas and thereby prevent bubble formation. Once bubbles have formed and then become symptomatic, recompression is required for resolution. Recompression in a chamber is safest, but if recompression in a chamber is unavailable or will be delayed many hours due to travel time, recompression in the water can be considered.
    

      
      Divers experiencing decompression sickness (DCS) require recompression on pure oxygen to dissolve the gas bubbles in their blood and tissues, allow excess nitrogen to diffuse out, and oxygenate ischemic tissues, thereby treating the disease process. Recompression has classically been achieved with a special chamber allowing a controlled increase in ambient pressure as well as a treating physician or technician to care for the stricken diver. There has been an alarming decrease in the number of recompression chambers available for 24-hour emergency care across the nation, resulting in divers with DCS facing long transit times to available chambers. This delay in care negatively affects the diver’s probability of complete recovery, resulting in many divers considering the alternative known as in-water recompression (IWR). IWR involves intentionally placing the stricken diver back in the water on pure oxygen, typically with a prolonged oxygen-breathing period at 30 FSW or less, with a gradual ascent to the surface. In water, recompression has been used for decades by several navies throughout the world as well as globally in remote areas where local recompression chambers are simply not available. The Australians developed and have used a relatively standardized protocol for several years, as has the United States Navy for use in extraordinary circumstances, as it is normal navy policy to have a chamber on-site for diving operations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29630272/,2022-11-28 02:46:35 AM
Re: Don't dive cold when you don't have to,"Neal W Pollock, Neal W Pollock",2015 Sep,"The letter by Clarke et al unfortunately misrepresents the work at the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) to which it refers, and delivers a confused picture of the physiological impact of thermal status on decompression stress. A series of earlier reports outline the importance of thermal status. Being warm during a dive results in higher post-dive Doppler bubble scores. Hot water suits are associated with a higher rate of decompression sickness (DCS) than passively insulated drysuits. Post-dive cooling can prolong the risk window for developing symptoms of skin bends.The NEDU chamber study provided an elegant design to further assess the impact of thermal stress. Dives to 37 msw (120 fsw) were divided into descent/bottom and ascent/stop phases, prolonging the latter so that bottom times could be increased if results allowed without compromising the experimental structure. The water temperature was held at either 36 °C (97 °F; 'warm') or 27 °C (80 °F; 'cold'). The 'warm/cold' exposure, with a bottom time of 30 minutes, yielded a DCS rate of 22% (7/32 subject-exposures). The 'cold/warm' bottom time was increased to 70 minutes and still yielded a DCS rate of only 1.3% (2/158). Even if the effects are exaggerated by the prolonged ascent/stop phase, the dramatic results demand serious attention. Contrary to the claim made by Clarke et al in their letter, the high temperature employed in the NEDU study could almost certainly be maintained at the skin by a number of active heating garments available to the diving public. Hot water suits are not required for the effect; and the 'cold' study temperature (better described as 'cool') is clearly well within the range experienced by divers. The statement by Clarke et al that ""the Navy uses their extensive mathematical expertise to select the one dive profile that, in their estimation, is the most likely to identify a difference in decompression risk..."" is frankly baffling. Use of a single dive depth in no way invalidates the relevance to other dive profiles. Similarly, it is not reasonable to characterize skin temperatures lower than those produced in the study as ""venturing into the unknown"" and thereby invalidating the results. Scientific method does encourage the confirmation of findings. This goal, however, does not diminish the value of singular, well-designed studies. The NEDU study is certainly one of these, most valuable in reminding divers that factors beyond the pressure-time profile will affect decompression risk. Divers must have adequate thermal protection to function effectively (physically and cognitively) throughout a dive. However, excessive warming during the descent/bottom phase increases inert gas uptake and can compromise decompression safety. Practically, while it may be optimal for divers to be cool or cold during the descent/bottom phase, it is prudent to recommend a thermoneutral range and avoidance of any excessive warming. Being cool during the ascent/stop phase inhibits inert gas elimination and can compromise safety but sudden warming must be constrained to avoid reducing the gas solubility of superficial tissues that could promote localized bubble formation and symptoms of skin bends. Active heating systems are attractive, but they have the potential to create the worst decompression stress condition; excessive heating during the descent/bottom phase and cooling during the ascent/stop phase if they fail part way through a dive. The risk is still elevated, though, if the systems work throughout a dive. Gerth et al were able to increase the bottom time to 70 minutes for both the 'coldwarm' and 'warm-warm' conditions, but the rate of DCS was significantly lower for the 'cold-warm' condition (see above). This lesson is relevant to any diving exposure. Ultimately, divers need to be aware of the potential impact of thermal status. Thermal protection should preserve clear thinking and physical performance, but excessive manipulation should be avoided. For many, passive systems will provide adequate and appropriate protection. For those who need or choose active warming systems, thoughtful use is vital. Further research is required to quantify the hazards and be able to incorporate thermal status into decompression algorithms in a meaningful way.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415074/,2022-11-28 02:46:36 AM
Comparison of the size of persistent foramen ovale and atrial septal defects in divers with shunt-related decompression illness and in the general population,"Peter T Wilmshurst, W Lindsay Morrison, Kevin P Walsh, Peter T Wilmshurst, W Lindsay Morrison, Kevin P Walsh",2015 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Decompression illness (DCI) is associated with a right-to-left shunt, such as persistent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. About one-quarter of the population have a PFO, but considerably less than one-quarter of divers suffer DCI. Our aim was to determine whether shunt-related DCI occurs mainly or entirely in divers with the largest diameter atrial defects.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Case control comparison of diameters of atrial defects (PFO and ASD) in 200 consecutive divers who had transcatheter closure of an atrial defect following shunt-related DCI and in an historic group of 263 individuals in whom PFO diameter was measured at post-mortem examination.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the divers who had experienced DCI, the median atrial defect diameter was 10 mm and the mean (standard deviation) was 9.9 (3.6) mm. Among those in the general population who had a PFO, the median diameter was 5 mm and mean was 4.9 (2.6) mm. The difference between the two groups was highly signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001). Of divers with shunt-related DCI, 101 (50.5%) had an atrial defect 10 mm diameter or larger, but only 1.3% of the general population studied had a PFO that was 10 mm diameter of larger.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The risk of a diver suffering DCI is related to the size of the atrial defect rather than just the presence of a defect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165530/,2022-11-28 02:46:37 AM
Trade-offs between foraging reward and mortality risk drive sex-specific foraging strategies in sexually dimorphic northern elephant seals,"Sarah S Kienle, Ari S Friedlaender, Daniel E Crocker, Rita S Mehta, Daniel P Costa, Sarah S Kienle, Ari S Friedlaender, Daniel E Crocker, Rita S Mehta, Daniel P Costa",2022 Jan 19,"Sex-specific phenotypic differences are widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Reproductive advantages provided by trait differences come at a cost. Here, we link sex-specific foraging strategies to trade-offs between foraging reward and mortality risk in sexually dimorphic northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). We analyse a decadal dataset on movement patterns, dive behaviour, foraging success and mortality rates. Females are deep-diving predators in open ocean habitats. Males are shallow-diving benthic predators in continental shelf habitats. Males gain six times more mass and acquire energy 4.1 times faster than females. High foraging success comes with a high mortality rate. Males are six times more likely to die than females. These foraging strategies and trade-offs are related to different energy demands and life-history strategies. Males use a foraging strategy with a high mortality risk to attain large body sizes necessary to compete for females, as only a fraction of the largest males ever mate. Females use a foraging strategy with a lower mortality risk, maximizing reproductive success by pupping annually over a long lifespan. Our results highlight how sex-specific traits can drive disparity in mortality rates and expand species' niche space. Further, trade-offs between foraging rewards and mortality risk can differentially affect each sex's ability to maximize fitness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35116140/,2022-11-28 02:46:37 AM

      Literature review.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To conduct a literature review of studies reporting the incidence of pars interarticularis defects in athletes of specific sports, in order to allow more targeted prevention and treatment strategies to be implemented for the groups at highest risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic searches were performed using PubMed, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials from their dates of inception to September 2017, with the following keywords: ""spondylolysis,"" ""sports,"" ""low back pain,"" and ""pars defects.""
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 509 total articles were retrieved, of which 114 were used in the final review. The incidence of pars interarticularis defects was found to be highest in diving (35.38%), cricket (31.97%), baseball/softball (26.91%), rugby (22.22%), weightlifting (19.49%), sailing (17.18%), table tennis (15.63%), and wrestling (14.74%). Only 5 studies reported the management instituted for their participants, and these were all case reports. Of 74 players with spondylolysis in these studies, 70 (94.59%) underwent conservative treatment and 4 (5.41%) underwent surgical treatment. 61 (82.43%) returned to their previous level of play, 6 (8.11%) retired, and the disposition of the final 7 was not reported.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The current medical literature provides good evidence that the incidence of pars interarticularis defects is higher in the athletic population, with the highest incidence in diving. There remains no gold standard protocol for the management of pars interarticularis defects.

While in previous decades the high cost of acoustic instruments limited its use, miniaturization and microprocessor advances dramatically reduced the cost for passive acoustic monitoring instruments making PAM available for a broad scientific community. Such low-cost devices are often deployed by divers or on mooring lines with a surface buoy, which limit their use to diving depth and coastal regions. Here, we present a low-cost, low self-noise and hand-deployable PAM mooring design, called TOSSIT. It can be used in water as deep as 500 m, and can be deployed and recovered by hand by a single operator (more comfortably with two) in a small boat. The TOSSIT modular mooring system consists of a light and strong non-metallic frame that can fit a variety of sensors including PAM instruments, acoustic releases, additional power packages, environmental parameter sensors. The TOSSIT's design is rope-less, which removes any risk of entanglement and keeps the self-noise very low.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35509916/,2022-11-28 02:46:39 AM
Inter- and intrasex habitat partitioning in the highly dimorphic southern elephant seal,"Mark A Hindell, Clive R McMahon, Ian Jonsen, Robert Harcourt, Fernando Arce, Christophe Guinet, Mark A Hindell, Clive R McMahon, Ian Jonsen, Robert Harcourt, Fernando Arce, Christophe Guinet",2021 Jan 29,"Partitioning resources is a key mechanism for avoiding intraspecific competition and maximizing individual energy gain. However, in sexually dimorphic species it is difficult to discern if partitioning is due to competition or the different resource needs of morphologically distinct individuals. In the highly dimorphic southern elephant seal, there are intersexual differences in habitat use; at Iles Kerguelen, males predominantly use shelf waters, while females use deeper oceanic waters. There are equally marked intrasexual differences, with some males using the nearby Kerguelen Plateau, and others using the much more distant Antarctic continental shelf (~2,000 km away). We used this combination of inter and intrasexual behavior to test two hypotheses regarding habitat partitioning in highly dimorphic species. (a) that intersexual differences in habitat use will not appear until the seals diverge in body size and (b) that some habitats have higher rates of energy return than others. In particular, that the Antarctic shelf would provide higher energy returns than the Kerguelen Shelf, to offset the greater cost of travel. We quantified the habitat use of 187 southern elephant seals (102 adult females and 85 subadult males). The seals in the two groups were the same size (~2.4 m) removing the confounding effect of body size. We found that the intersexual differences in habitat use existed before the divergence in body size. Also, we found that the amount of energy gained was the same in all of the major habitats. This suggests that the use of shelf habitats by males is innate, and a trade-off between the need to access the large benthic prey available on shelf waters, against the higher risk of predation there. Intrasexual differences in habitat use are another trade-off; although there are fewer predators on the Antarctic shelf, it is subject to considerable interannual fluctuations in sea-ice extent. In contrast, the Kerguelen Plateau presents more consistent foraging opportunities, but contains higher levels of predation. Habitat partitioning in this highly dimorphic species is therefore the result of complex interplay of life history strategies, environmental conditions and predation pressure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33613994/,2022-11-28 02:46:40 AM

He had a nasal glass cut from the radix to the supratip area which was primarily closed by non-absorbable suture. The following day, there was a haematoma and necrosis of the skin. The haematoma was drained under local anaesthesia. Blood supply to the nasal skin was severely compromised and only the columellar artery remaining intact, by definition designating this a difficult to heal wound with the risk of overall healing failure. Necrosis of the skin had developed within the first 24 hours. Accordingly, the patient underwent 30 HBOT sessions (two hours at 253.3 kPa) twice daily for four days and daily thereafter. Antibiotic cover and conservative wound management were also used. Complete healing was achieved without the need for additional surgical intervention.

The pathology and the wet/dry ratio of lung tissues, immunohistochemical detection of lung tissue CD41 expression, the numbers of P-selectin positive platelets and platelet-leukocyte conjugates in blood were tested. We found that Clo significantly reduced the DCS mortality risk (mortality rate: 11/45 with Clo vs. 28/46 in the untreated group, P<0.01).

"Benzo[a]pyrene exposure and overcrowding stress impacts anxiety-like behavior and impairs learning and memory in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio","Sai Aparna, Manorama Patri, Sai Aparna, Manorama Patri",2021 Mar,"Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a prototype of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ubiquitous environmental pollutant, alters neurobehavioral responses in aquatic organisms like zebrafish. Increasing organic load on water bodies causes population explosion leading to overcrowding (OC) stress. The effect of OC stress on neurobehavioral alterations remains unclear. The objective of our study is to elucidate the impact of OC stress on behavioral alterations and neurodegenerative phenotypes on exposure to B[a]P in zebrafish. We demonstrate the effects of OC stress (12 fish/L) on acute waterborne exposure to B[a]P (0.2 mg L-1 ) in adult wild zebrafish. Anxiety-like behavior, learning, and memory impairment were assayed by novel tank diving test, light/dark preference test, and T-maze test. Oxidative stress bio-markers were assayed along with histopathological changes in zebrafish brain. OC stress significantly impaired the learning ability and mood behavior by increasing the number of transition and time spent in the alter zones. Increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation with significant decreased catalase activity and reduced glutathione level showed oxidative stress on exposure to OC stress and B[a]P. Pyknotic neuronal counts dramatically increased in periventricular grey zone of optic tectum brain region of zebrafish. Our findings showed that OC stress modulates the B[a]P-induced behavioral alterations causing learning and memory deficiency with histopathological changes in adult zebrafish brain. OC stress may act as an early risk factor for the eventual development of cognitive impairments and B[a]P exposure plays a key role in mediating both the facilitating and impairing actions of OC stress in memory processes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33280238/,2022-11-28 02:46:43 AM

There is a need for new and effective treatments that patients can tolerate without significant adverse effects. One potential intervention is hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). The case reported here is unique in describing repeated HBOT in a patient who developed recurrent post-traumatic CRPS of the lower as well as the upper limbs. In the first event, two months after distortion and abruption of the external right ankle, the patient suffered leg pain, oedema formation, mild hyperaemia, limited mobility of the ankle and CRPS Type 1. In the second event, the same patient suffered fracture-dislocation of the distal radius 1.5 years after the first injury. After the plaster cast was removed the patient developed pain, warmth, colour changes, oedema formation and limited wrist mobility with CRPS Type 1. Pharmacological treatment as well as HBOT were used with significant improvement of functional outcome in both cases. Some studies suggest that patients with a history of CRPS are more likely to develop secondary CRPS compared to the rates reported in the literature among the general population. Patients with a history of CRPS should be counselled that they may be at risk for developing secondary CRPS if they undergo surgery or sustain trauma to another extremity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761551/,2022-11-28 02:46:44 AM
Physiological effects of rapid reduction in carbon dioxide partial pressure in submarine tower escape,"Geoffrey A M Loveman, Fiona M Seddon, Julian C Thacker, M Graham White, Karen M Jurd, Geoffrey A M Loveman, Fiona M Seddon, Julian C Thacker, M Graham White, Karen M Jurd",2014 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to determine whether adverse effects from a rapid drop in inspired carbon dioxide partial pressure (PiCO₂) in the breathing gas could hinder or prevent submarine tower escape.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 34 male volunteers, mean (SD) age 33.8 (7.5) years, completed the trial. They breathed air for five minutes then 5% CO₂/16% O₂, 79% N₂ (5CO₂/16O₂) for 60 minutes before switching to breathing 100% O₂ for 15 minutes and then returned to air breathing. Breathing gases were supplied from cylinders via scuba regulators and mouthpieces. Blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity, electrocardiogram and end-tidal CO₂ and end-tidal O₂ were monitored throughout. Subjects were asked at intervals to indicate symptom type and severity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Symptoms whilst breathing 5CO₂/16O₂ included breathlessness and headache. Following the switch to 100% O₂ seven subjects reported mild to moderate faintness, which was associated with a significant drop in cerebral blood flow compared to those who did not feel faint (P < 0.02). No subject vomited or fainted following this breathing-gas switch.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study shows that the risk of fainting, sudden collapse or vomiting on switching to 100% O₂ following acute exposures to hypercapnia at a PiCO₂ of up to 5.0 kPa is less than 8%.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24986726/,2022-11-28 02:46:45 AM
Poorly designed research does not help clarify the role of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of chronic diabetic foot ulcers,"Mesut Mutluoglu, Gunalp Uzun, Michael Bennett, Peter Germonpré, David Smart, Daniel Mathieu, Mesut Mutluoglu, Gunalp Uzun, Michael Bennett, Peter Germonpré, David Smart, Daniel Mathieu",2016 Sep,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the most common indications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). The role of HBOT in DFUs is often debated. Recent evidence based guidelines, while recommending its use, urge further studies to identify the patient subgroups most likely to benefit from HBOT. A recent study in Diabetes Care aimed to assess the efficacy of HBOT in reducing the need for major amputation and improving wound healing in patients with chronic DFUs. In this study, patients with Wagner grade 2-4 diabetic foot lesions were randomly assigned to have HBOT (30 sessions/90 min/244 kPa) or sham treatment (30 sessions/90 min/air/125 kPa). Six weeks after the completion of treatment (12 weeks after randomization) neither the fulfillment of major amputation criteria (11/49 vs. 13/54, odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.37, 2.28], P = 0.846) nor wound-healing rates (20% vs. 22%, 0.90 [0.35, 2.31], P = 0.823) significantly differed between groups. The authors concluded that HBOT does not offer any additional advantage over comprehensive wound care. Since this paper was published in Diabetes Care, one of the most prestigious diabetes journals, it is likely it will have a major impact on the clinical practice of many physicians dealing with diabetic foot problems. Although from a methodological standpoint the conduct of the study (prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled) seems to be close to ideal, several significant flaws render the conclusions weak. Firstly, there were some problems with the assessment of the primary outcome of ""meeting the criteria for amputation"". In their published protocol paper, the trial lists indicated that ""At the end of the 6-week follow-up phase……, the patient is sent to the participating vascular surgeon for an amputation evaluation"". However, in the published report in Diabetes Care, it is evident that patients were not assessed in a face-to-face consultation, but rather by the remote examination of wound photographs and clinical data ""Participant clinical data together with digital photographs of the study wound progress were presented to the vascular surgeon"". This departure from the original intent undermines the primary outcome of the study significantly. Fedorko et al claim this method of assessment has been validated, but neither of their supporting citations appear to substantiate this claim. Wirthlin et al assessed the level of agreement about a collection of wounds between surgeons who were present at the bedside and a remote group who assessed the wounds using a short clinical account and digital photography. There was reasonable agreement between onsite and remote, although the specificity for particular signs ranged from just 27% (erythema) to 100% (ischaemia). Importantly, only a subset of eight of the 24 included patients had non-healing wounds and the proportion of those that were associated with diabetes mellitus is unknown. Further, the need for amputation was not among the management decisions examined. Wirthlin et al concluded ""a prospective trial of remote wound management …. is needed to further validate this technology."" The authors of the second supposedly supporting citation were mainly interested in the assessment of pressure ulcers by digital photography using the Photographic Wound Assessment Tool (PWAT) compared to the Pressure Sore Status Tool (PSST). Of the 81 included lower leg ulcers, it is not clear how many were associated with diabetes mellitus. Indications for amputation were not considered. The authors concluded ""The PWAT may be valuable when a bedside assessment cannot be made. However, the size of circular wounds, wound depth, undermining/tunneling, and odor cannot be assessed using photographs."" In the Fedorko paper, the decision that there was an indication for amputation was made by the remote vascular surgeon by meeting any of the following criteria: ""persistent deep infection involving bone and tendons (antibiotics required, hospitalization required, pathogen involved); ongoing risk of severe systemic infection related to the wound; inability to bear weight on the affected limb; or pain causing significant disability"". We are particularly concerned that the criteria, ""persistent deep infection involving bone and tendons"", is subjective. Recent studies have demonstrated that diabetic foot osteomyelitis may not necessarily require amputation and some cases may be cured with antibiotic therapy alone. It is interesting to note that despite the high numbers of participants assessed as fitting the requirements for amputation (23% overall), no patient actually had a major amputation. The amputation outcome is inappropriately assessed, done at the wrong time, and the study is grossly underpowered to find any difference in the rate of true major amputation. Finally, whether the surgeon performed a baseline assessment of amputation prior to the randomised intervention is unknown. A comparison between the pre- and post-study estimates of amputation rates could have contributed to the interpretation of the results. Secondly, the authors fail to provide a clear comparison of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) between the groups. Although patients were randomized and those who were possible candidates for major vessel revascularization were excluded from the study, microvascular status was not assessed. No transcutaneous oxygen measurements were made on any of the patients. Given that, firstly, the risk of microvascular vessel compromise increases with diabetes duration, and secondly, transcutaneous oxygen measurements correlate with the possibility of good response to HBOT, it is possible that clinically significant differences between groups were undetected. As an example, patients in the HBOT group had a markedly longer mean duration of diabetes (19.1 vs. 12.4 years) and would be likely to have more severe microvascular disease. Thirdly, the follow-up period of six weeks after completion of treatment is very short. The study to which the authors refer to justify this follow-up period enrolled only patients with ulcers of Wagner grade 1 or 2 and specifically excluded patients with infection or ischaemia. These are not representative of the patient population treated with HBOT. The outcomes in patients with DFUs treated with HBOT should be assessed over a longer period. One such randomized controlled study demonstrated that patients receiving HBOT had significantly higher healing rates than placebo at one-year follow-up (25/48 (52%) versus 12/42 (29%); P 〈 0.03), but not at 12 weeks. Fourthly, the authors also failed to describe the experience of the vascular surgeon who adjudicated the wounds for amputation; how many years he was involved in the management of diabetic foot wounds or how specialized his practice was with these patients. Objective and universally recognized indications for amputation are yet to be established. Therefore, a multidisciplinary decision-making approach, rather than a single physician's decision, would have increased the credibility of the conclusion the authors reached. Notably, all previous studies of HBOT in this area have used actual amputation rates in order to have a clear clinical endpoint. Careful patient selection is paramount for the cost-effective use of HBOT as an adjunct to normal wound care in diabetic wounds. As it is possible to identify wounds that have no potential to heal despite HBOT, all studies should incorporate transcutaneous oxygen measurements in their baseline evaluation. As the wounds in this study tended to be small (6.1cm² and 5.8cm² on average) and had persisted for (on average) one year despite state-of-the-art previous wound care, it is likely that at least some of these would not meet the predictive minimal criteria for healing potential with HBOT. The findings of this study do indeed show that the indiscriminate treatment of all diabetic wounds with HBOT is probably not (cost-) effective; however, the study conclusion that ""HBO has no benefit in the treatment of chronic diabetic foot wounds"" is erroneous.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723012/,2022-11-28 02:46:45 AM

Preventing diseases in round-the-world travelers: a contemporary challenge for travel medicine advice,"Karis Maria de Pinho Rodrigues, Beatriz Meurer Moreira, Karis Maria de Pinho Rodrigues, Beatriz Meurer Moreira",2018 Mar-Apr,"Providing advice for travelers embarking on long-term trips poses a challenge in travel medicine. A long duration of risk exposure is associated with underuse of protective measures and poor adherence to chemoprophylaxis, increasing the chances of acquiring infections. Recently, in our clinic, we observed an increase in the number of travelers undertaking round-the-world trips. These individuals are typically aged around 32 years and quit their jobs to embark on one-to-two-year journeys. Their destinations include countries in two or more continents, invariably Southeast Asia and Indonesia, and mostly involve land travel and visiting rural areas. Such trips involve flexible plans, increasing the challenge, especially with regard to malaria prophylaxis. Advising round-the-world travelers is time-consuming because of the amount of information that must be provided to the traveler. Advisors must develop strategies to commit the traveler to his/her own health, and verify their learnings on disease-prevention measures. Contacting the advisor after the appointment or during the trip can be helpful to clarify unclear instructions or diagnosis made and prescriptions given abroad. Infectious diseases are among the most frequent problems affecting travelers, many of which are preventable by vaccines, medicines, and precautionary measures. The dissemination of counterfeit medicines, particularly antibiotics and antimalarial medicines, emphasizes the need for travelers to carry medicines that they may possibly need on their trip. Additional advice on altitude, scuba diving, and other possible risks may also be given. Considering the difficulties in advising this group, we present a review of the main recommendations on advising these travelers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768543/,2022-11-28 02:46:47 AM
Cardiovascular risk in high-hazard occupations: the role of occupational cardiology,"Iain T Parsons, Edward D Nicol, David Holdsworth, Norbert Guettler, Rienk Rienks, Constantinos H Davos, Martin Halle, Gianfranco Parati, Iain T Parsons, Edward D Nicol, David Holdsworth, Norbert Guettler, Rienk Rienks, Constantinos H Davos, Martin Halle, Gianfranco Parati",2022 Mar 30,"Work is beneficial for health, but many individuals develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) during their working lives. Occupational cardiology is an emerging field that combines traditional cardiology sub-specialisms with prevention and risk management unique to specific employment characteristics and conditions. In some occupational settings incapacitation through CVD has the potential to be catastrophic due to the nature of work and/or the working environment. These are often termed 'hazardous' or 'high-hazard' occupations. Consequently, many organizations that employ individuals in high-hazard roles undertake pre-employment medicals and periodic medical examinations to screen for CVD. The identification of CVD that exceeds predefined employer (or regulatory body) risk thresholds can result in occupational restriction, or disqualification, which may be temporary or permanent. This article will review the evidence related to occupational cardiology for several high-hazard occupations related to aviation and space, diving, high altitude, emergency workers, commercial transportation, and the military. The article will focus on environmental risk, screening, surveillance, and risk management for the prevention of events precipitated by CVD. Occupational cardiology is a challenging field that requires a broad understanding of general cardiology, environmental, and occupational medicine principles.

EMS Pneumothorax Identification Without Ancillary Testing,"Matthew M. Talbott, Abraham Campos, Onyinyechukwu Okorji, Thomas J. Martel, Matthew M. Talbott, Abraham Campos, Onyinyechukwu Okorji, Thomas J. Martel",,"Pneumothorax is a principal diagnosis for emergency medical services (EMS) providers to identify, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is commonly associated with complaints such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and trauma. The condition spans all age groups, and EMS providers should, therefore, maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax for any patient with a sudden onset of acute respiratory distress and ipsilateral chest pain.
    

      
      Pneumothorax is the entry of air into the potential space between the parietal and visceral pleura. Air can enter the chest cavity from a disrpution in the lung tissue or trauma to the pleura. Lung tissue can spontaneously rupture in patients with risk factors such as tobacco use, Marfan’s syndrome, underwater diving, airplane travel, and male gender. It can also occur secondarily as a part of a chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, or pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to the destruction of lung tissue. EMS providers may also encounter several different mechanisms of injury that violate the pleura creating a pneumothorax, such as penetrating trauma to the chest or blunt trauma with a rib fracture. EMS providers may be called to the outpatient setting where medical procedures involving the chest or neck may cause an iatrogenic pneumothorax, such as central venous catheter placement, thoracentesis, and lung biopsies.
    

      
      EMS providers are challenged in making the diagnosis for several reasons. They do not have access to emergency department diagnostic equipment such as chest radiographs and point of care thoracic ultrasound which may clinch the diagnosis. Many patients will have comorbid conditions that may mimic a pneumothorax including COPD/asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), and pleural effusions, which may cause decreased breath sounds during acute exacerbations and acute dyspnea. A hemothorax will have a similar presentation as a pneumothorax, with symptoms such as dyspnea, hypoxia, decreased breath sounds, and chest pain. A key clinical finding that separates these two is that a pneumothorax will have hyper-resonance to percussion, but a hemothorax will have a hypo-resonance to percussion. Definitive treatment of both conditions may require a chest tube depending on the level of severity, but only a tension pneumothorax will require needle decompression.
    

      
      Ambient noise in the field may drown out differences in lateralized breath sounds. Low light, body fluid, and other environmental factors may make otherwise obvious chest wall openings unapparent in emergencies. In the appropriate clinical setting of acute dyspnea, but equivocal breath sounds, EMS providers may percuss the thorax for unilateral hyper-resonance and asymmetric tactile fremitus in making the diagnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30422463/,2022-11-28 02:46:48 AM
Interobserver Agreement in Pediatric Cervical Spine Injury Assessment Between Prehospital and Emergency Department Providers,"Lorin R Browne, Hamilton Schwartz, Fahd A Ahmad, Michael Wallendorf, Nathan Kuppermann, E Brooke Lerner, Julie C Leonard, Lorin R Browne, Hamilton Schwartz, Fahd A Ahmad, Michael Wallendorf, Nathan Kuppermann, E Brooke Lerner, Julie C Leonard",2017 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Investigators have derived cervical spine injury (CSI) decision support tools from physician observations. There is a need to demonstrate that prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) providers can use these tools to appropriately determine the need for spinal motion restrictions and make field disposition decisions.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The objective was to determine the interobserver agreement between EMS and emergency department (ED) providers for CSI risk assessment variables and overall gestalt for CSI in children after blunt trauma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a planned, substudy of a four-site, prospective cohort of children < 18 years transported by EMS to pediatric EDs for evaluation of CSI after blunt trauma. Inclusion criteria were trauma team activation and/or EMS-initiated spinal motion restriction. Exclusion criteria were penetrating trauma, transfer to another facility for definitive care, state custody, or substantial language barrier. For each eligible child, the transporting EMS provider and treating ED provider independently recorded their clinical assessment for CSI. This included mechanism of injury and patient history and physical examination findings. We assessed each paired variable for interobserver agreement between EMS and ED provider using kappa (κ) analysis. We considered variables with κ lower confidence interval values ≥0.4 to have moderate or better agreement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We obtained 1,372 paired observations for 29 variables. After finding prevalence and observer bias were adjusted for, all variables achieved moderate to better agreement including eight variables previously shown to be independently associated with CSI in children: diving mechanism, high-risk motor vehicle collision, altered mental status, focal neurologic findings, neck pain, torticollis, substantial torso injury, and predisposing medical condition. EMS and ED providers, however, showed less than moderate agreement for their overall gestalt for CSI in children. Of note, both EMS and ED providers did not assess for neck pain, inability to move the neck, and/or cervical spine tenderness in more than 10% of study patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Emergency medical services and ED providers achieved at least moderate agreement in the assessment of CSI risk factors in children after blunt trauma. However, EMS and ED providers did not achieve moderate agreement on gestalt for CSI and some risk factors went unassessed by providers. These findings support the development of a pediatric CSI risk assessment tool for EMS and ED providers to reduce interventions for those children at very low risk for CSIs while still identifying all children with injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28921731/,2022-11-28 02:46:49 AM

The natural history of this subtype is poorly understood. Incomplete literature in the era of rituximab suggests that patients with EBV-positive DLBCL have similar outcomes to patients with EBV-negative DLBCL when treated with rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens; however, there are few prospective studies on this subtype and little is known about the risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse with EBV-positive DLBCL. Herein, we describe the case of a 64-year-old man who presented with stage IIA EBV-positive DLBCL. His international age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) was 2. He achieved a complete response to 6 cycles of rituximab combined with chemotherapy consisting of dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. After 10 days of completion of chemotherapy, he had a fulminant neurologic decline manifested by diffuse weakness followed by a locked-in syndrome; he could only communicate by moving his eyes. He had been deemed at low risk for CNS relapse based on the application of the recently developed CNS-IPI score of 2 (1 point for age >60 years and 1 point for lactate dehydrogenase higher than normal) and consequently did not receive therapy for CNS prophylaxis. A limited postmortem autopsy revealed extensive lymphoma throughout the brain, particularly in the deep basal nuclei, midbrain, pons, centrum semiovale, and corpus callosum. This presentation of CNS relapse is rare and has not yet been described in EBV-positive DLBCL. We discuss some of the unique aspects of this case including the clinical manifestations of locked-in syndrome and its differential diagnosis and the uncertain benefits of CNS prophylaxis in this clinical context.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29623003/,2022-11-28 02:46:50 AM
Ovine plasma dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine does not predict decompression bubbling,"Ran Arieli, Soliman Khatib, Jacob Vaya, Ran Arieli, Soliman Khatib, Jacob Vaya",2019 Jan,"Decompression illness (DCI) is the main risk associated with scuba diving. Some divers (""bubblers"") are more sensitive to DCI than others (""non-bubblers""). We found that there are active hydrophobic spots (AHS) on the luminal aspect of ovine blood vessels, which contain the surfactant dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). DPPC leaks from the lung into the plasma, settling on the blood vessel to create AHS. These are the main source of gas micronuclei from which bubbles develop after decompression. A correlation between bubbling ovine blood vessels and the animal's plasma DPPC might lead to the development of a blood test for vulnerability to DCI. Samples from ovine blood vessels were stretched on microscope slides, placed anaerobically in saline at the bottom of a Pyrex bowl, and exposed to high pressure. Automated photography was used after decompression to reveal AHS by visualising their bubble production. Phospholipids were extracted from the AHS and plasma for determination of DPPC. Bubbling was unrelated to the concentration of DPPC in the plasma (2.15 ± 0.87 μg/ml). Bubble production from the AHS (n = 130) as a function of their DPPC content yielded two groups, one unrelated to DPPC and the other which demonstrated increased bubbling with elevation of DPPC. We suggest this may be related to alternate layering with hydrophobic and hydrophilic phospholipids. This study reinforces the connection between DPPC and DCI. However, a blood test for diver vulnerability to decompression stress is not recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29969702/,2022-11-28 02:46:51 AM

This is crucial in selecting a safe refuge during a predatory attack and may strongly affect predator-prey interactions. We explored the possible presence of lateralization in the anti-predatory behaviour of European pond turtles, considering their escape facing a possible predatory attack. Thirty individuals (17 males, 13 females) were exposed to three different environmental situations of gradually increasing predatory threat: escape underwater from an unsafe shelter, diving into the water from a basking site and righting after being overturned. All turtles were tested 20 times for each of the three experiments (60 trials per individual; 1800 overall trials). We recorded multiple behavioural responses in the general context of predation risk. This was done in order to assess both the existence of lateralization and possible correlations among different behaviours as function of lateralization. The number of significant responses to the left side was always prevalent in each of the three simulated anti-predatory situations, suggesting the existence of a lateralized behaviour in this species. At the individual level, the differences we found in the three experiments could be related to different ecological contexts and consequent risk of predation. Our findings, among the few on chelonians, support the possible involvement of right hemisphere activity and, most importantly, reveal how the complexity of a general predatory context can affect the laterality of escape behaviour.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30127081/,2022-11-28 02:46:51 AM

One theory is that venous gas emboli crossing the PFO can be minimized by avoiding lifting, straining and Valsalva maneuvers. Alternatively, we hypothesized that mild increases in external inspiratory and expiratory resistance, similar to that provided by a SCUBA regulator, recruit the PFO. Nine healthy adults with a Valsalva-proven PFO completed three randomized trials (inspiratory, expiratory, and combined external loading) with six levels of increasing external resistance (2-20 cmH2 O/L/sec). An agitated saline contrast echocardiogram was performed at each level to determine foramen ovale patency. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no relationship between the number of subjects recruiting their PFO and the level of external resistance. In fact, at least 50% of participants recruited their PFO during 14 of 18 trials and there was no difference between the combined inspiratory, expiratory, or combined external resistance trials (P > 0.05). We further examined the relationship between PFO recruitment and intrathoracic pressure, estimated from esophageal pressure. Esophageal pressure was not different between participants with and without a recruited PFO. Intrasubject variability was the most important predictor of PFO patency, suggesting that some individuals are more likely to recruit their PFO in the face of even mild external resistance. Right-to-left bubble passage through the PFO occurs in conditions that are physiologically relevant to divers.

      Middle ear barotrauma (MEBt) is a frequently occurring complication of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). High-grade MEBt may involve tympanic membrane (TM) haemorrhaging. Although many patients undergoing HBOT use antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, it is unknown whether these drugs increase the risk of MEBt and particularly TM bleeding complications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This multicentre, prospective cohort study investigates the prevalence of MEBt and TM bleeding during HBOT in patients using antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs, compared with control patients not on such medications. MEBt was assessed by video otoscopy of the TM pre and post HBOT and scored according to the modified Teed score. Any complications from previous HBOT sessions were retrospectively documented.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 73 patients receiving HBOT, 34 used antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs. Mild MEBt (Teed score 1 or 2) occurred in 23 of these 34 patients and in 31 of the 39 controls. Teed score 3 MEBt occurred in only two of the control-group patients and none of the patients using antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs. Two patients using anticoagulant drugs reported epistaxis during a previous HBOT session, epistaxis was not reported by any control patients.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Low-grade MEBt is common during HBOT, however, high-grade barotrauma is rare with current chamber operating procedures. Patients using antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs potentially may be prone to MEBt-associated haemorrhagic complications, but we did not observe any such increase in this cohort. Only mild epistaxis occurred in patients using anticoagulant drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27044458/,2022-11-28 02:46:53 AM
Body fat does not affect venous bubble formation after air dives of moderate severity: theory and experiment,"Nico A M Schellart, Tjeerd P van Rees Vellinga, Rob A van Hulst, Nico A M Schellart, Tjeerd P van Rees Vellinga, Rob A van Hulst",2013 Mar 1,"For over a century, studies on body fat (BF) in decompression sickness and venous gas embolism of divers have been inconsistent. A major problem is that age, BF, and maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2max) show high multicollinearity. Using the Bühlmann model with eight parallel compartments, preceded by a blood compartment in series, nitrogen tensions and loads were calculated with a 40 min/3.1 bar (absolute) profile. Compared with Haldanian models, the new model showed a substantial delay in N2 uptake and (especially) release. One hour after surfacing, an increase of 14-28% in BF resulted in a whole body increase of the N2 load of 51%, but in only 15% in the blood compartment. This would result in an increase in the bubble grade of only 0.01 Kisman-Masurel (KM) units at the scale near KM = I-. This outcome was tested indirectly by a dry dive simulation (air breathing) with 53 male divers with a small range in age and Vo2max to suppress multicollinearity. BF was determined with the four-skinfold method. Precordial Doppler bubble grades determined at 40, 80, 120, and 160 min after surfacing were used to calculate the Kisman Integrated Severity Score and were also transformed to the logarithm of the number of bubbles/cm(2) (logB). The highest of the four scores yielded logB = -1.78, equivalent to KM = I-. All statistical outcomes of partial correlations with BF were nonsignificant. These results support the model outcomes. Although this and our previous study suggest that BF does not influence venous gas embolism (Schellart NAM, van Rees Vellinga TP, van Dijk FH, Sterk W. Aviat Space Environ Med 83: 951-957, 2012), more studies with different profiles under various conditions are needed to establish whether BF remains (together with age and Vo2max) a basic physical characteristic or will become less important for the medical examination and for risk assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23305985/,2022-11-28 02:46:54 AM
[Fewer cases of decompression sickness in Västra Götaland. Eight years of statistics show a reduced number of consultations and treatments],"Sandra Wenneberg, Per Arnell, Nicklas Oscarsson, Hans Örnhagen, Sandra Wenneberg, Per Arnell, Nicklas Oscarsson, Hans Örnhagen",2014 Sep,"During the period 2005 to 2012, a total of 340 consultations (phone calls and/or visits) regarding possible decompression illness were recorded at the two hospitals with recompression chambers in the Västra Götaland region, Sweden. An analysis of the data showed a trend towards fewer consultations and recompression treatments. A similar trend has been observed in many other countries. Possible reasons for this reduction in the number of cases are discussed. Most of the patients only present relatively mild signs and symptoms at the time of consultation. This, together with the fact that the number of patients is low, involves a risk that awareness and knowledge regarding correct handling and care in diving accidents might be lost. Since rapid and correct care of decompression illness is important to avoid later sequeale it is important that competence in diving medicine is maintained at hospitals Nationwide.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25606654/,2022-11-28 02:46:55 AM
Allometric scaling of decompression sickness risk in terrestrial mammals; cardiac output explains risk of decompression sickness,"Andreas Fahlman, Andreas Fahlman",2017 Feb 2,"A probabilistic model was used to predict decompression sickness (DCS) outcome in pig (70 and 20 kg), hamster (100 g), rat (220 g) and mouse (20 g) following air saturation dives. The data set included 179 pig, 200 hamster, 360 rat, and 224 mouse exposures to saturation pressures ranging from 1.9-15.2 ATA and with varying decompression rates (0.9-156 ATA • min-1). Single exponential kinetics described the tissue partial pressures (Ptiss) of N2: Ptiss = ∫(Pamb - Ptiss) • τ-1 dt, where Pamb is ambient N2 pressure and τ is a time constant. The probability of DCS [P(DCS)] was predicted from the risk function: P(DCS) = 1-e-r, where r = ∫(PtissN2 - Thr - Pamb) • Pamb-1 dt, and Thr is a threshold parameter. An equation that scaled τ with body mass included a constant (c) and an allometric scaling parameter (n), and the best model included n, Thr, and two c. The final model provided accurate predictions for 58 out of 61 dive profiles for pig, hamster, rat, and mouse. Thus, body mass helped improve the prediction of DCS risk in four mammalian species over a body mass range covering 3 orders of magnitude.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150725/,2022-11-28 02:46:56 AM
Aerospace Decompression Illness,"Richard A. de la Cruz, Roselyn W. Clemente Fuentes, Sundonia J. Wonnum, Jeffrey S. Cooper, Richard A. de la Cruz, Roselyn W. Clemente Fuentes, Sundonia J. Wonnum, Jeffrey S. Cooper",,"Decompression illness can occur after exposure to reduced environmental pressure in situations involving diving and aviation as well. High altitudes can expose flight crews and individuals to the risk of decompression illness. The general pathophysiology involves gas, such as nitrogen, forming bubbles in tissue, which is responsible for the symptoms ranging from relatively minor symptoms to profound neurologic manifestations. 
    

      
      Traditionally, decompression sickness (DCS) is categorized as type 1, referring to skin changes and milder symptoms such as joint pain, or type 2, referring to more severe symptoms involving the neurologic, cardiac, and pulmonary systems.

Whole-body active heating does not preserve finger temperature or manual dexterity during cold-water immersion,"Courtney E Wheelock, Hayden W Hess, Zachary J Schlader, Blair Jd Johnson, David Hostler, Courtney E Wheelock, Hayden W Hess, Zachary J Schlader, Blair Jd Johnson, David Hostler",2020 Second Quarter,"Background:
        
      
      Cold-water immersion impairs manual dexterity when finger temperature is below 15°C. This exposes divers to increased risk of error. We hypothesized that whole-body active heating would maintain finger temperatures and dexterity during cold-water immersion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve subjects (six males) (22 ± 2 years old; BMI 23.9 ± 2.5; body fat 16 ± 6%) completed 60-minute head-out water immersion (HOWI) wearing a 7mm wetsuit and 3mm gloves in thermoneutral water (TN 25°C) and cold water (CW 10°C) while wearing a water-perfused suit (WP) with 37°C water circulated over the torso, arms, and legs. Gross (Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test [MMDT]) and fine (modified Purdue Pegboard [PPT]) dexterity were assessed before, during and after immersion. Core body and skin temperatures were recorded every 10 minutes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      MMDT (TN -25 ± 14%; CW -72 ± 23%; WP -67 ± 29%; p<0.05) and PPT (TN -16 ± 9%; CW: -45 ± 10%; WP: -38 ± 13%; p<0.05) performance decreased during immersion. MMDT and PPT did not differ between CW and WP. Immediately following immersion gross dexterity was recovered in all conditions. Post-immersion fine dexterity was still impaired in CW (p<0.01), but not WP or TN. Core and skin temperatures decreased during immersion in CW and WP (p<0.05) but did not differ between CW and WP.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Manual dexterity decreased during immersion. Dexterity was further impaired during cold-water immersion and was not maintained by water perfusion active heating. Warm water perfusion did not maintain finger temperature above 15°C but hand temperature remained above these limits, suggesting a need to reassess thermal thresholds for working divers in cold-water conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32574442/,2022-11-28 02:46:57 AM
"Geographic range size, water temperature, and extrinsic threats predict the extinction risk in global cetaceans","Chuanwu Chen, Thomas A Jefferson, Bingyao Chen, Yanping Wang, Chuanwu Chen, Thomas A Jefferson, Bingyao Chen, Yanping Wang",2022 Nov,"Despite the fact that cetaceans provide significant ecological contributions to the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems, many are highly endangered with nearly one-third of species assessed as threatened with extinction. Nevertheless, to date, few studies have explicitly examined the patterns and processes of extinction risk and threats for this taxon, and even less between the two subclades (Mysticeti and Odontoceti). To fill this gap, we compiled a dataset of six intrinsic traits (active region, geographic range size, body weight, diving depth, school size, and reproductive cycle), six environmental factors relating to sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration, and two human-related threat indices that are commonly recognized for cetaceans. We then employed phylogenetic generalized least squares models and model selection to identify the key predictors of extinction risk in all cetaceans, as well as in the two subclades. We found that geographic range size, sea surface temperature, and human threat index were the most important predictors of extinction risk in all cetaceans and in odontocetes. Interestingly, maximum body weight was positively associated with the extinction risk in mysticetes, but negatively related to that for odontocetes. By linking seven major threat types to extinction risk, we further revealed that fisheries bycatch was the most common threat, yet the impacts of certain threats could be overestimated when considering all species rather than just threatened ones. Overall, we suggest that conservation efforts should focus on small-ranged cetaceans and species living in warmer waters or under strong anthropogenic pressures. Moreover, further studies should consider the threatened status of species when superimposing risk maps and quantifying risk severity. Finally, we emphasize that mysticetes and odontocetes should be conserved with different strategies, because their extinction risk patterns and major threat types are considerably different. For instance, large-bodied mysticetes and small-ranged odontocetes require special conservation priority.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36008887/,2022-11-28 02:46:58 AM
Prehospital Factors Associated With Cervical Spine Injury in Pediatric Blunt Trauma Patients,"Lorin R Browne, Fahd A Ahmad, Hamilton Schwartz, Michael Wallendorf, Nathan Kuppermann, E Brooke Lerner, Julie C Leonard, Lorin R Browne, Fahd A Ahmad, Hamilton Schwartz, Michael Wallendorf, Nathan Kuppermann, E Brooke Lerner, Julie C Leonard",2021 May,"Background:
        
      
      The risk for cervical spine injury (CSI) must be assessed in children who sustain blunt trauma. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) retrospectively derived CSI model identifies CSI risk in children based on emergency department (ED) provider observations. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the univariate association of emergency medical services (EMS) provider-observed historical, mechanistic, and physical examination factors with CSI in injured children. Secondarily, we assessed the performance of the previously identified eight PECARN CSI risk factors (PECARN model) based exclusively on EMS provider observation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a four-center, prospective observational study of children 0 to 17 years old who were transported by EMS after blunt trauma and underwent spinal motion restriction or trauma team activation in the ED. In the ED, EMS providers recorded their observations for a priori determined CSI risk factors. CSIs were classified by reviewing imaging, consultations, and/or telephone follow-up. We calculated bivariable relative risks and test characteristics for the PECARN model based solely on EMS provider observations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1,372 enrolled children, 25 (1.8%) had CSIs. Of the a priori determined CSI risk factors, seven factors had bivariable associations with CSIs: axial load, altered mental status, signs of basilar skull fracture, substantial torso injury, substantial thoracic injury, respiratory distress, and decreased oxygen saturation. The PECARN model (high-risk motor vehicle collision, diving mechanism, predisposing condition, neck pain, decreased neck mobility, altered mental status, neurologic deficits, and/or substantial torso injury) exhibited the following test characteristics when based on EMS provider observations: sensitivity = 96.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.3% to 100.0%); negative predictive value = 99.8% (95% CI = 99.4% to 100.0%); specificity = 38.5% (95% CI = 35.9% to 41.1%); and positive predictive value = 2.8% (95% CI = 1.7% to 3.9%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      EMS providers can identify risk factors associated with CSI in injured children who experience blunt trauma. These risk factors may be considered for inclusion in a pediatric CSI decision rule specific to the prehospital setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33217762/,2022-11-28 02:46:58 AM

This process requires exclusion of significant underlying cardiopulmonary disease and this consensus statement (from experts across the field) outlines the appropriate screening and investigative processes that should be undertaken. The recommended response is based on simple screening in primary healthcare to determine those at risk, followed by first line investigations, including an exercise capacity assessment, to identify the small proportion of individuals who may have circulatory, pulmonary, or mixed disease. These individuals can then receive more advanced, targeted investigations. This statement provides a pragmatic, evidence-based approach for those (in all occupations) to assess employee health and capacity prior to a return to work following severe disease, or while continuing to experience significant post-COVID-19 symptoms (so-called 'long-COVID' or post-COVID-19 syndrome).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35266533/,2022-11-28 02:46:59 AM
Radiocesium in migratory aquatic game birds using contaminated U.S. Department of Energy reactor-cooling reservoirs: A long-term perspective,"Robert A Kennamer, Ricki E Oldenkamp, James C Leaphart, Joshua D King, A Lawrence Bryan Jr, James C Beasley, Robert A Kennamer, Ricki E Oldenkamp, James C Leaphart, Joshua D King, A Lawrence Bryan Jr, James C Beasley",2017 May,"Low-level releases of radiocesium into former nuclear reactor cooling-reservoirs on the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA, dating primarily to the late 1950s and early 1960s, have allowed examination of long-term contaminant attenuation in biota occupying these habitats. Periodic collections of migratory game birds since the 1970s have documented 137Cs (radiocesium) activity concentrations in birds of SRS reservoirs, including mainly Par Pond and Pond B. In this study, during 2014 and 2015 we released wild-caught American coots (Fulica americana) and ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris) onto Pond B. We made lethal collections of these same birds with residence times ranging from 32 to 173 days to examine radiocesium uptake and estimate the rate of natural attenuation. The two species achieved asymptotic whole-body activity concentrations of radiocesium at different times, with ring-necked ducks requiring almost three times longer than the 30-35 days needed by coots. We estimated ecological half-life (Te) for Pond B coots over a 28-yr period as 16.8 yr (95% CI = 12.9-24.2 yr). Pond B coot Te was nearly four times longer than Te for coots at nearby Par Pond where radiocesium bioavailability had been constrained for decades by pumping of potassium-enriched river water into that reservoir. Te could not be estimated from long-term data for radiocesium in Pond B diving ducks, including ring-necked ducks, likely because of high variability in residence times of ducks on Pond B. Our results highlight the importance: (1) for risk managers to understand site-specific bio-geochemistry of radiocesium for successful implementation of countermeasures at contaminated sites and (2) of residence time as a critical determinant of observed radiocesium activity concentrations in highly mobile wildlife inhabiting contaminated habitats.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28273599/,2022-11-28 02:47:00 AM

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Model Systems and Shriners Hospital SCI units. Participants: Data were analyzed from 42,627 cases in the SCI Model System Collaborative Survival Study Database from 1973 to 2017. Those with SCI etiologies categorized as vehicular, violent, sports, falls, pedestrian, and medical were included. Interventions: Not applicable. Outcome Measure: Time to mortality after SCI. Results: Relative to the sports related etiology category, those with medical, pedestrian, violence, falls, and vehicular related SCIs had a 2.00 (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.79-2.24), 1.57 (CIs: 1.34-1.83), 1.54 (CIs: 1.41-1.68), 1.35 (CIs: 1.25-1.45), and 1.26 (CIs: 1.17-1.35) higher hazard for mortality, respectfully. Persons with SCIs from automobile crashes had a 1.38 (CIs: 1.23-1.56) higher hazard for mortality, whereas those with SCIs from motorcycle crashes had a 1.21 (CIs: 1.04-1.39) higher hazard for mortality, relative to other etiologies within the vehicular category. Those with SCIs from diving had a 1.37 (CIs: 1.18-1.59) higher hazard for mortality relative to other etiologies within the sports category. Conclusions: Injury etiology categories and certain sub-categories were associated with a higher risk for early mortality.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for intensive care patients: position statement by the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine,"Daniel Mathieu, Beatrice Ratzenhofer-Komenda, Jacek Kot, Daniel Mathieu, Beatrice Ratzenhofer-Komenda, Jacek Kot",2015 Mar,"Many of the accepted indications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may occur in critically ill patients. HBOT itself may cause a number of physiological changes which may further compromise the patient's state. Guidelines on the management of critically ill patients in a hyperbaric facility have been founded on the conclusions of the 2007 European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine (ECHM) meeting. With regard to patient management, HBOT should be included in the overall care of ICU patients only after a risk/benefit assessment related to the specifics of both the hyperbaric centre and the patient's clinical condition and should not delay or interrupt their overall management. Neither patient monitoring nor treatment should be altered or stopped due to HBOT, and any HBOT effects must be strictly evaluated and appropriately mitigated. With regard to the hyperbaric facility itself, the hyperbaric chamber should be specifically designed for ICU patients and should be fully equipped to allow continuation of patient monitoring and treatment. The hyperbaric chamber ideally should be located in, or around the immediate vicinity of the ICU, and be run by a sufficiently large and well-trained team of physicians, nurses, chamber operators and technicians. All devices to be introduced into the chamber should be evaluated, tested and acknowledged as safe for use in a hyperbaric environment and all procedures (standard and emergency) should be tested and written before being implemented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964038/,2022-11-28 02:47:02 AM

Caloric restriction decreases orthostatic tolerance independently from 6° head-down bedrest,"John P Florian, Friedhelm J Baisch, Martina Heer, James A Pawelczyk, John P Florian, Friedhelm J Baisch, Martina Heer, James A Pawelczyk",2015 Apr 27,"Astronauts consume fewer calories during spaceflight and return to earth with an increased risk of orthostatic intolerance. Whether a caloric deficiency modifies orthostatic responses is not understood. Thus, we determined the effects of a hypocaloric diet (25% caloric restriction) during 6° head down bedrest (an analog of spaceflight) on autonomic neural control during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Nine healthy young men completed a randomized crossover bedrest study, consisting of four (2 weeks each) interventions (normocaloric bedrest, normocaloric ambulatory, hypocaloric bedrest, hypocaloric ambulatory), each separated by 5 months. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was recorded at baseline following normocaloric and hypocaloric interventions. Heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure were recorded before, during, and after 3 consecutive stages (7 min each) of LBNP (-15, -30, -45 mmHg). Caloric and posture effects during LBNP were compared using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. There was a strong trend toward reduced basal MSNA following caloric restriction alone (normcaloric vs. hypocaloric: 22±3 vs. 14±4 burst/min, p = 0.06). Compared to the normocaloric ambulatory, both bedrest and caloric restriction were associated with lower systolic blood pressure during LBNP (p<0.01); however, HR responses were directionally opposite (i.e., increase with bedrest, decrease with caloric restriction). Survival analysis revealed a significant reduction in orthostatic tolerance following caloric restriction (normocaloric finishers: 12/16; hypocaloric finishers: 6/16; χ2, p = 0.03).

Achondroplasia,"Janet M Legare, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Janet M Legare, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature. Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal bossing and midface retrusion. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed. Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy. Additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or who have atypical findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Vosoritide, a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, was recently approved to enhance height in individuals with achondroplasia from age five years until growth plates close. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required for increased intracranial pressure; suboccipital decompression as indicated for signs and symptoms of craniocervical junction compression; adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, and, rarely, tracheostomy to correct obstructive sleep apnea; pressure-equalizing tubes for middle ear dysfunction; monitor and treat obesity; evaluation and treatment by an orthopedist if progressive bowing of the legs arises; spinal surgery may be needed for severe, persistent kyphosis; surgery to correct spinal stenosis in symptomatic adults; modification in the school and work setting to optimize function; educational support in socialization and school adjustment.
    

Surveillance: Monitor height, weight, and head circumference in childhood using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia; evaluation of developmental milestones throughout infancy and childhood using achondroplasia-specific standards; baseline neuroimaging of craniocervical junction and brain in infancy; neurologic examinations monitoring for signs of cervical myelopathy; monitor for signs and symptoms of sleep apnea; hearing evaluation as a newborn and tympanometric and behavioral audiometric evaluation by age approximately one year; monitor for middle ear problems or evidence of hearing loss in childhood; clinical assessment for kyphosis and bowed legs, with radiographic evaluation and referral to an orthopedist if necessary; in adults, clinical history and neurologic examination to screen for spinal stenosis with development of any new signs or symptoms or at least every three to five years; discuss social adjustment at each visit with primary care provider.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Rear-facing car seats should be used as long as possible to avoid injury from motor vehicle accident. Avoid soft-back infant seats and front carriers without a firm back. Avoid activities in which there is risk of injury to the craniocervical junction, such as collision sports; use of a trampoline; diving from diving boards; vaulting in gymnastics; and hanging upside down from the knees or feet on playground equipment (due to risk of falling onto the head or neck).
    

Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section delivery because of small pelvic size.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner with average stature is at 50% risk in each pregnancy of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their offspring of having average stature is 25%; of having achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition), 25%. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias. If the FGFR3 pathogenic variant has been identified in the affected parent or parents, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for achondroplasia is possible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301331/,2022-11-28 02:47:04 AM
Alternative responses to predation in two headwater stream minnows is reflected in their contrasting diel activity patterns,"Wilbert T Kadye, Anthony J Booth, Wilbert T Kadye, Anthony J Booth",2014 Apr 1,"Animals exhibit diel periodicity in their activity in part to meet energy requirements whilst evading predation. A competing hypothesis suggests that partitioning of diel activities is less important because animals capitalise on opportunity. To test these hypotheses we examined the diel activity patterns for two cyprinid minnows, chubbyhead barb Barbus anoplus and the Eastern Cape redfin minnow Pseudobarbus afer that both occur within headwater streams in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Chubbyhead barbs exhibited consistent nocturnal activity based on both field and laboratory observations. Due to the absence of fish predators within its habitat, its nocturnal behaviour suggests a response to the cost associated with diurnal activity, such as predation risk by diving and wading birds. In contrast, redfin minnows showed high diurnal activity and a shoaling behaviour in the wild, whereas, in the laboratory, they showed high refuge use during the diel cycle. Despite their preference for refuge in the laboratory, they were diurnally active, a behaviour that was consistent with observations in the wild. The diurnal activity of this species suggests a response to the cost associated with nocturnal activity. Such a cost could be inferred from the presence of the longfin eel, a native predator that was active at night, whereas the daytime shoaling behaviour suggests an anti-predator mechanism to diurnal visual predators. The implications of these findings relate to the impacts associated with the potential invasions by non-native piscivores that occur in the mainstem sections. Diurnal activity patterns for redfin minnows, that are IUCN-listed as endangered, may, in part, explain their susceptibility to high predation by visual non-native piscivores, such as bass and trout. In contrast, the nocturnal habits of chubbyhead barbs suggest a probable pre-adaptation to visual predation. The likelihood of invasion by nocturnally-active sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus, however, may compromise this prior advantage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24691382/,2022-11-28 02:47:05 AM
Interobserver agreement in retrospective chart reviews for factors associated with cervical spine injuries in children,"Cody S Olsen, Nathan Kuppermann, David M Jaffe, Kathleen Brown, Lynn Babcock, Prashant V Mahajan, Julie C Leonard, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Cervical Spine Injury Study Group, Cody S Olsen, Nathan Kuppermann, David M Jaffe, Kathleen Brown, Lynn Babcock, Prashant V Mahajan, Julie C Leonard, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Cervical Spine Injury Study Group",2015 Apr,"Objectives:
        
      
      The objective was to describe the interobserver agreement between trained chart reviewers and physician reviewers in a multicenter retrospective chart review study of children with cervical spine injuries (CSIs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medical records of children younger than 16 years old with cervical spine radiography from 17 Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) hospitals from years 2000 through 2004 were abstracted by trained reviewers for a study aimed to identify predictors of CSIs in children. Independent physician-reviewers abstracted patient history and clinical findings from a random sample of study patient medical records at each hospital. Interobserver agreement was assessed using percent agreement and the weighted kappa (κ) statistic, with lower 95% confidence intervals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Moderate or better agreement (κ > 0.4) was achieved for most candidate CSI predictors, including altered mental status (κ = 0.87); focal neurologic findings (κ = 0.74); posterior midline neck tenderness (κ = 0.74); any neck tenderness (κ = 0.89); torticollis (κ = 0.79); complaint of neck pain (κ = 0.83); history of loss of consciousness (κ = 0.89); nonambulatory status (κ = 0.74); and substantial injuries to the head (κ = 0.50), torso/trunk (κ = 0.48), and extremities (κ = 0.59). High-risk mechanisms showed near-perfect agreement (diving, κ = 1.0; struck by car, κ = 0.93; other motorized vehicle crash, κ = 0.93; fall, κ = 0.92; high-risk motor vehicle collision, κ = 0.89; hanging, κ = 0.80). Fair agreement was found for clotheslining mechanisms (κ = 0.36) and substantial face injuries (κ = 0.40).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most retrospectively assessed variables thought to be predictive of CSIs in blunt trauma-injured children had at least moderate interobserver agreement, suggesting that these data are sufficiently valid for use in identifying potential predictors of CSI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25779540/,2022-11-28 02:47:06 AM
Investigation of Brain Impairment Using Diffusion-Weighted and Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Experienced Healthy Divers,"Mehmet Hakan Seyithanoğlu, Anas Abdallah, Tolga Turan Dündar, Serkan Kitiş, Ayşe Aralaşmak, Meliha Gündağ Papaker, Hadi Sasani, Mehmet Hakan Seyithanoğlu, Anas Abdallah, Tolga Turan Dündar, Serkan Kitiş, Ayşe Aralaşmak, Meliha Gündağ Papaker, Hadi Sasani",2018 Nov 17,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to understand the changes of decompression illness in healthy divers by comparing diffusion-weighted (DWI) and diffusion tensor MRI findings among healthy professional divers and healthy non-divers with no history of diving. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 26 people were recruited in this prospective study: 11 experienced divers with no history of neurological decompression disease (cohort) and 15 healthy non-divers (control). In all study subjects, we evaluated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and type of diffusion tensor metric fractional anisotropy (FA) values of different brain locations (e.g., frontal and parieto-occipital white matter, hippocampus, globus pallidus, putamen, internal capsule, thalamus, cerebral peduncle, pons, cerebellum, and corpus callosum). RESULTS ADC values of hippocampus were high in divers but low in the control group; FA values of globus pallidus and putamen were lower in divers compared to the control group. DWI depicted possible changes due to hypoxia in different regions of the brain. Statistically significant differences in ADC values were found in hypoxia, particularly in the hippocampus (p=0.0002), while FA values in the globus pallidus and putamen were statistically significant (p=0.015 and p=0.031, respectively). We detected forgetfulness in 6 divers and deterioration in fine-motor skills in 2 divers (p=0.002 and p=0.17, respectively). All of them were examined using neuro-psychometric tests. CONCLUSIONS Repeated hyperbaric exposure increases the risk of white matter damage in experienced healthy divers without neurological decompression illness. The hippocampus, globus pallidus, and putamen are the brain areas responsible for memory, learning, navigation, and fine-motor skills and are sensitive to repeated hyperbaric exposure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30447152/,2022-11-28 02:47:07 AM
"Softball injuries treated in US EDs, 1994 to 2010","John C Birchak, Lynne M Rochette, Gary A Smith, John C Birchak, Lynne M Rochette, Gary A Smith",2013 Jun,"Background:
        
      
      Softball is a popular participant sport in the United States. This study investigated the epidemiology of softball injuries with comparisons between children and adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for patients 7 years and older treated in an emergency department (ED) for a softball injury from 1994 through 2010 were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An estimated 2107823 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1736417-2479229) patients were treated in US EDs for a softball injury during the 17-year study period. The annual number of injuries decreased by 23.0% from 1994 to 2010 (P < .001); however, during the last 6 years of the study, injuries increased by 11.7% (P = .008). The annual rate of softball injuries increased significantly during the study period (P = .035). The most commonly injured body regions were the hand/wrist (22.2%) and face (19.3%). Being hit by a ball was the most common mechanism of injury (52.4%) and accounted for most of face (89.6%) and head (75.7%) injuries. Injuries associated with running (relative risk, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.97-2.82) and diving for a ball (relative risk, 4.61; 95% CI, 3.50-6.09) were more likely to occur among adult than pediatric patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate softball injuries using a nationally representative sample. Softball is a common source of injury among children and adults. Increased efforts are needed to promote safety measures, such as face guards, mouth guards, safety softballs, and break-away bases, to decrease these injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23602754/,2022-11-28 02:47:07 AM
Medical expenditures in division I collegiate athletics: an analysis by sport and gender,"Christopher C Kaeding, James Borchers, Janine Oman, Angela Pedroza, Christopher C Kaeding, James Borchers, Janine Oman, Angela Pedroza",2014 Sep,"Objective:
        
      
      Medical expenses for collegiate athletics include providing a training room with its supplies, equipment, personnel costs, and insurance coverage. Additional expenses beyond the training room include imaging, diagnostic testing, specialty consultations, and surgeries. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in average expenses or number of claims between male and female athletes over a 5-year period.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective patient cohort.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      A sports medicine center serving athletes in Big 10 Conference intercollegiate sports.
    


          Assessment of risk factors:
        
      
      All medical claims and charges for 36 varsity teams were analyzed from 2005 to 2010. The teams were categorized into 3 groups: female-only teams, male-only teams, and coed teams. Analysis of sports with corresponding male and female teams was also performed.
    


          Main outcome measurements:
        
      
      Claims and charges for medical care for 36 intercollegiate athletic teams over 5 years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Individual team claims and charges were stable over the study period. In 11 of the 14 sex-matched sports, the female teams had higher average annual charges. After normalizing for roster size in the sex-matched sports, females had 0.97 more average annual claims (P < 0.01) and $1459 higher annual charges (P = 0.001) than their male counterparts. The charges per claim were similar between the sexes. The 5 teams with the highest average annual charges were football, wrestling, softball, women's crew, and men's lacrosse. When normalized for roster size, the 5 sports with the highest average annual charges per athlete were softball, women's diving, men's basketball, wrestling, and men's gymnastics.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Charges per claim were similar between the sex-matched sports, but the female sports had a higher number of annual claims per athlete and thus higher total charges per athlete/year. Football had the highest average annual total charges as a team, but when normalized for roster size football charges per athlete/year were similar to those of other sports.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25295769/,2022-11-28 02:47:08 AM

The present work intended to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations. Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption responsible for the effects observed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31561291/,2022-11-28 02:47:09 AM

The sightings, behaviours, and pictures used for photographic identification were obtained during August to November 2012-2014 onboard tourist boats in Guadalupe Island, Mexico. Four types of baits were used: (1) frozen bait; (2) frozen bait and natural chum; (3) fresh fish bait; and (4) mackerel bags. Data were analysed according to sex, maturity and the total of sharks using 6,145 sightings of 121 white sharks. The type of bait showed no significant difference on the effectiveness to attracting sharks. Ethological analysis showed that the type of bait had a significant effect on the shark's surface behaviour during its interactions with boats. Natural chum and fresh baits showed short term behavioural patterns constituted by increased number of violent interactions with the bait, while the frozen bait did not generate a defined behavioural pattern. Conditioning of white sharks was determined by the number of interactions and the consumption frequency of the bait. Fifty nine percent of sharks (n = 41) showed no conditioning, 36% (n = 25) showed a low risk and only 5% (n = 3) were found to have a high risk of conditioning. The results suggest that current ecotourism has no effect on the conditioning of the white sharks, and that all baits have a similar effectiveness for attracting the sharks. However, a different behavioural pattern was observed when fresh bait and chum were used, which could increase the potential of accidents during ecotourism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32636493/,2022-11-28 02:47:10 AM
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS FOR NONFATAL DROWNING IN THE MIGRANT CHILDREN,"Yinchao Zhu, Guozhang Xu, Hui Li, Yaqin Huang, Ke Ding, Jieping Chen, Yinchao Zhu, Guozhang Xu, Hui Li, Yaqin Huang, Ke Ding, Jieping Chen",2015 Nov,"The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and potential risk factors for nonfatal drowning among migrant workers' children in China. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of students from third to ninth grade at five Migrant Workers' Children schools in Ningbo, China in 2014. General information and a history of nonfatal drowning was obtained from self-reported questionnaires by migrant students. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify potential risk factors. A total 3,859 students were included in the current study. Of these, 13.4% had experienced a nonfatal drowning accident (15.2% for males, 11.2% for females). Most nonfatal drowning occurred in natural water settings. Diving into unknown water without adult supervision had the greatest association with history of nonfatal drowning [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidential interval (CI): 1.31-2.95], followed by fishing in water (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05-2.14), swimming or playing in water (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.02-2.12), and trying to rescue peers in the water if they were drowning (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.64). There were factors associated with a lower risk of drowing: having a parent accompany the child to school (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51-0.93),understanding the the danger of swimming alone (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48-0.99) and having a knowledge about water safety (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99). The study population was at inceased risk for nonfatal drowning. Preventive measures, such as improved water-safety knowledge, decreasing risky water-related activities and better supervision of children need to be developed and tested to decrease the risk of nonfatal drowning among the study population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26867370/,2022-11-28 02:47:10 AM
Uncommon Occurrences of Air Embolism: Description of Cases and Review of the Literature,"Giorgio Berlot, Adriano Rinaldi, Marco Moscheni, Massimo Ferluga, Perla Rossini, Giorgio Berlot, Adriano Rinaldi, Marco Moscheni, Massimo Ferluga, Perla Rossini",2018 Jul 8,"Many different risk factors have been associated with the occurrence of gas embolism making this potentially lethal complication easily avoidable. However, this condition can occur in circumstances not commonly reported. Three different and extremely uncommon cases of gas embolism are presented and discussed: the first was caused by the voluntary ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, the second occurred during a retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and the last followed the intrapleural injection of Urokinase. Whereas in the first patient the gas embolism was associated with only relatively mild digestive symptoms, in the remaining two it caused a massive cerebral ischemia and an extended myocardial infarction, respectively. Despite a hyperbaric oxygen therapy performed timely in each case, only the first patient survived. The classical risk factors associated with gas embolism like indwelling central venous catheters, diving accidents, etc. are rather well known and thus somewhat preventable; however, a number of less common and difficult-to-recognize causes can determine this condition, making the correct diagnosis elusive and delaying the hyperbaric oxygen therapy, whose window of opportunity is rather narrow.

Comparison of Reef Fish Survey Data Gathered by Open and Closed Circuit SCUBA Divers Reveals Differences in Areas With Higher Fishing Pressure,"Andrew E Gray, Ivor D Williams, Kostantinos A Stamoulis, Raymond C Boland, Kevin C Lino, Brian B Hauk, Jason C Leonard, John J Rooney, Jacob M Asher, Keolohilani H Lopes Jr, Randall K Kosaki, Andrew E Gray, Ivor D Williams, Kostantinos A Stamoulis, Raymond C Boland, Kevin C Lino, Brian B Hauk, Jason C Leonard, John J Rooney, Jacob M Asher, Keolohilani H Lopes Jr, Randall K Kosaki",2016 Dec 9,"Visual survey by divers using open-circuit (OC) SCUBA is the most widely used approach to survey coral reef fishes. Therefore, it is important to quantify sources of bias in OC surveys, such as the possibility that avoidance of OC divers by fishes can lead to undercounting in areas where targeted species have come to associate divers with a risk of being speared. One potential way to reduce diver avoidance is to utilize closed circuit rebreathers (CCRs), which do not produce the noise and bubbles that are a major source of disturbance associated with OC diving. For this study, we conducted 66 paired OC and CCR fish surveys in the Main Hawaiian Islands at locations with relatively high, moderate, and light fishing pressure. We found no significant differences in biomass estimates between OC and CCR surveys when data were pooled across all sites, however there were differences at the most heavily fished location, Oahu. There, biomass estimates from OC divers were significantly lower for several targeted fish groups, including surgeonfishes, targeted wrasses, and snappers, as well as for all targeted fishes combined, with mean OC biomass between 32 and 68% of mean CCR biomass. There were no clear differences between OC and CCR biomass estimates for these groups at sites with moderate or low fishing pressure, or at any location for other targeted fish groups, including groupers, parrotfishes, and goatfishes. Bias associated with avoidance of OC divers at heavily fished locations could be substantially reduced, or at least calibrated for, by utilization of CCR. In addition to being affected by fishing pressure, the extent to which avoidance of OC divers is problematic for visual surveys varies greatly among taxa, and is likely to be highly influenced by the survey methodology and dimensions used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27936044/,2022-11-28 02:47:12 AM
Rescue of drowning victims and divers: is mechanical ventilation possible underwater? A pilot study,"Bernd E Winkler, Claus Martin Muth, Wataru Kaehler, Gebhard Froeba, Michael Georgieff, Andreas Koch, Bernd E Winkler, Claus Martin Muth, Wataru Kaehler, Gebhard Froeba, Michael Georgieff, Andreas Koch",2013 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      In-water resuscitation has recently been proposed in the European resuscitation guidelines. Initiation of mechanical ventilation underwater might be considered when an immediate ascent to the surface is impossible or dangerous. The present study evaluated the feasibility of such ventilation underwater.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A resuscitation manikin was ventilated using an Interspiro® MK II full-face mask or with an Oxylator® ventilator via a facemask or a laryngeal tube, or with mouth-to-tube inflation. Tidal volumes achieved by the individual methods of ventilation were assessed. The ventilation tests were performed during dives in the wet compartment of a recompression chamber and in a lake. Ventilation was tested at 40, 30, 20, 12, 9 and 6 metres' depth.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ventilation was impossible with the cuffed mask and only sufficient after laryngeal intubation for a small number of breaths. Laryngeal tube ventilation was associated with the aspiration of large amounts of water and the Oxylator failed during the ascent. Efficient ventilation with the MK II full-face mask was also possible only for a short period. An absolutely horizontal position of the manikin was required for successful ventilation, which is likely to be difficult to achieve in open water. Leakage at the sealing lip of the full-face mask and the cuff of the laryngeal tube led to intrusion of water and resulted in subsequent complete failure of ventilation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The efficacy of underwater ventilation seems to be poor with any of the techniques trialed. Water aspiration frequently makes ventilation impossible and might foster emphysema aquosum-like air trapping and, therefore, increase the risk of pulmonary barotrauma during ascent. Because the limitations of underwater ventilation are substantial even under ideal conditions, it cannot be recommended presently for real diving conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813460/,2022-11-28 02:47:13 AM
Assessing ecological correlates of marine bird declines to inform marine conservation,"L Ignacio Vilchis, Christine K Johnson, Joseph R Evenson, Scott F Pearson, Karen L Barry, Peter Davidson, Martin G Raphael, Joseph K Gaydos, L Ignacio Vilchis, Christine K Johnson, Joseph R Evenson, Scott F Pearson, Karen L Barry, Peter Davidson, Martin G Raphael, Joseph K Gaydos",2015 Feb,"Identifying drivers of ecosystem change in large marine ecosystems is central for their effective management and conservation. This is a sizable challenge, particularly in ecosystems transcending international borders, where monitoring and conservation of long-range migratory species and their habitats are logistically and financially problematic. Here, using tools borrowed from epidemiology, we elucidated common drivers underlying species declines within a marine ecosystem, much in the way epidemiological analyses evaluate risk factors for negative health outcomes to better inform decisions. Thus, we identified ecological traits and dietary specializations associated with species declines in a community of marine predators that could be reflective of ecosystem change. To do so, we integrated count data from winter surveys collected in long-term marine bird monitoring programs conducted throughout the Salish Sea--a transboundary large marine ecosystem in North America's Pacific Northwest. We found that decadal declines in winter counts were most prevalent among pursuit divers such as alcids (Alcidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae) that have specialized diets based on forage fish, and that wide-ranging species without local breeding colonies were more prone to these declines. Although a combination of factors is most likely driving declines of diving forage fish specialists, we propose that changes in the availability of low-trophic prey may be forcing wintering range shifts of diving birds in the Salish Sea. Such a synthesis of long-term trends in a marine predator community not only provides unique insights into the types of species that are at risk of extirpation and why, but may also inform proactive conservation measures to counteract threats--information that is paramount for species-specific and ecosystem-wide conservation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25195954/,2022-11-28 02:47:14 AM

Athletes in leanness-demanding sports have an increased risk for RED-S and for developing EDs/DE. Special risk factors in aquatic sports related to weight and body composition management include the wearing of skimpy and tight-fitting bathing suits, and in the case of diving and synchronized swimming, the involvement of subjective judgments of performance. The reported prevalence of DE and EDs in athletic populations, including athletes from aquatic sports, ranges from 18 to 45% in female athletes and from 0 to 28% in male athletes. To prevent EDs, aquatic athletes should practice healthy eating behavior at all periods of development pathway, and coaches and members of the athletes' health care team should be able to recognize early symptoms indicating risk for energy deficiency, DE, and EDs. Coaches and leaders must accept that DE/EDs can be a problem in aquatic disciplines and that openness regarding this challenge is important.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24667155/,2022-11-28 02:47:15 AM
Epidemiology of concussion in sport: a literature review,"Michael B Clay, Kari L Glover, Duane T Lowe, Michael B Clay, Kari L Glover, Duane T Lowe",2013 Dec,"Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to summarize sport concussion incidence data, identify sports that present higher injury frequency, reveal the degree of risk in some lesser-known sports, and outline specific details within the sports literature that raise additional concerns, such as helmet-to-helmet contact and player positions that experience frequent impact.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature review of Pub Med using keyword search on injury, concussion, and sports was performed through May 2012. Abstracts were identified, selections were made based upon inclusion criteria, and full-length articles were obtained. Additional articles were considered following review of reference sections. Articles were reviewed and tabulated according to sport.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two hundred eighty-nine articles were screened, and 62 articles were reviewed. The overall incidence of concussion in sport ranged from 0.1 to 21.5 per 1000 athletic exposures. The lowest incidence was reported in swimming and diving. Concussion incidence was highest in Canadian junior ice hockey, but elevated incidence in American football remains a concern because of the large number of participants.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The literature reviewed included incidence of concussion on the field of play under real-world conditions and influenced by the current culture of sport. The studies examined in this article show that there is risk of concussion in nearly every sport. Some sports have higher concussion frequency than others, which may depend upon the forces and roles of the positions played in these sports. Younger athletes have a higher incidence of concussion, and female incidence is greater than male in many comparable sports. Headgear may reduce concussion in some sports but may also give athletes a false sense of protection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24396326/,2022-11-28 02:47:16 AM
Microplastic study reveals the presence of natural and synthetic fibres in the diet of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) foraging from South Georgia,"Camille Le Guen, Giuseppe Suaria, Richard B Sherley, Peter G Ryan, Stefano Aliani, Lars Boehme, Andrew S Brierley, Camille Le Guen, Giuseppe Suaria, Richard B Sherley, Peter G Ryan, Stefano Aliani, Lars Boehme, Andrew S Brierley",2020 Jan,"Marine ecosystems are experiencing substantial disturbances due to climate change and overfishing, and plastic pollution is an additional growing threat. Microfibres are among the most pervasive pollutants in the marine environment, including in the Southern Ocean. However, evidence for microfibre contamination in the diet of top predators in the Southern Ocean is rare. King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feed on mesopelagic fish, which undergo diel vertical migrations towards the surface at night. Microfibres are concentrated in surface waters and sediments but can also be concentrated in fish, therefore acting as contamination vectors for diving predators feeding at depth. In this study, we investigate microfibre contamination of King Penguin faecal samples collected in February and March 2017 at South Georgia across three groups: incubating, chick-rearing and non-breeding birds. After a KOH digestion to dissolve the organic matter and a density separation step using a NaCl solution, the samples were filtered to collect microfibres. A total of 77% of the penguin faecal samples (36 of 47) contained microfibres. Fibres were measured and characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy to determine their polymeric identity. Most fibres (88%) were made of natural cellulosic materials (e.g. cotton, linen), with only 12% synthetic (e.g. polyester, nylon) or semi-synthetic (e.g. rayon). An average of 21.9 ± 5.8 microfibres g-1 of faeces (lab dried mass) was found, with concentrations more than twice as high in incubating penguins than in penguins rearing chicks. Incubating birds forage further north at the Antarctic Polar Front and travel longer distances from South Georgia than chick-rearing birds. This suggests that long-distance travelling penguins are probably more exposed to the risk of ingesting microfibres when feeding north of the Antarctic Polar Front, which might act as a semi-permeable barrier for microfibres. Microfibres could therefore provide a signature for foraging location in King Penguins.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31726359/,2022-11-28 02:47:17 AM
Medical devices and procedures in the hyperbaric chamber,"Jacek Kot, Jacek Kot",2014 Dec,"The aim of this paper is to present current controversies concerning the safety of medical devices and procedures under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber including: defibrillation in a multiplace chamber; implantable devices during hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) and the results of a recent European questionnaire on medical devices used inside hyperbaric chambers. Early electrical defibrillation is the only effective therapy for cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The procedure of defibrillation under hyperbaric conditions is inherently dangerous owing to the risk of fire, but it can be conducted safely if certain precautions are taken. Recently, new defibrillators have been introduced for hyperbaric medicine, which makes the procedure easier technically, but it must be noted that sparks and fire have been observed during defibrillation, even under normobaric conditions. Therefore, delivery of defibrillation shock in a hyperbaric environment must still be perceived as a hazardous procedure. Implantable devices are being seen with increasing frequency in patients referred for HBOT. These devices create a risk of malfunction when exposed to hyperbaric conditions. Some manufacturers support patients and medical practitioners with information on how their devices behave under increased pressure, but in some cases an individual risk-benefit analysis should be conducted on the patient and the specific implanted device, taking into consideration the patient's clinical condition, the indication for HBOT and the capability of the HBOT facility for monitoring and intervention in the chamber. The results of the recent survey on use of medical devices inside European hyperbaric chambers are also presented. A wide range of non-CE-certified equipment is used in European chambers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25596835/,2022-11-28 02:47:18 AM
Reduction of bacterial load with the addition of ultraviolet-C disinfection inside the hyperbaric chamber,"Katrina Browne, Danielle Wood, Kate Clezy, Jan Lehm, William R Walsh, Katrina Browne, Danielle Wood, Kate Clezy, Jan Lehm, William R Walsh",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      Healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) are associated with increased mortality, morbidity and prolonged hospital stays. Microbiological contamination of the hospital environment directly contributes to HAIs. Optimising environmental cleaning reduces transmission of HAIs. The hyperbaric chamber poses a specific challenge for infection control as certain disinfectants and alcohol-based hand sanitisers are prohibited due to fire risk. Patients often possess multiple risk factors for HAIs. This study compared the bacteria remaining on a surface (bioburden) after a standard clean and after adjunctive disinfection with an ultraviolet-C (UV-C) robot.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Internal hyperbaric chamber surfaces were first manually cleaned with Clinell® universal wipes and the floor was mopped with Whiteley neutral detergent. Allocated surfaces were swabbed using sterile cotton swabs and processed using a standard microbial culture and a bacteria-specific rapid metabolic assay. Bacterial contamination was also measured by direct contact plating on flat surfaces. The plexiglass ports were covered to protect from potential UV-C mediated damage and used as a negative control. A UV-C disinfection robot was then used to disinfect the chamber for 30 min, whereafter surfaces were swabbed again.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was a significantly greater mean reduction in bioburden following adjunctive UV-C disinfection than with standard cleaning alone. The surfaces not routinely manually cleaned (e.g., bench, phone) showed greatest reduction in bacterial load following UV-C cleaning.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There was a significant reduction in the bacterial load in the chamber following an adjunctive UV-C clean compared with that of a standard clean. Adjunctive cleaning of the hyperbaric chamber environment with a non-touch UV-C device shows promise as a method to reduce HAIs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325012/,2022-11-28 02:47:19 AM
Hyperbaric oxygen treatment for mastectomy flap ischaemia: A case series of 50 breasts,"Nicole E Spruijt, Lisette T Hoekstra, Johan Wilmink, Maarten M Hoogbergen, Nicole E Spruijt, Lisette T Hoekstra, Johan Wilmink, Maarten M Hoogbergen",2021 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been suggested as an effective intervention to limit necrosis of ischaemic skin flaps after mastectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of HBOT in the largest series of patients to date with mastectomy flap ischaemia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis was performed of 50 breasts requiring HBOT for mastectomy flap ischaemia. The severity of the ischaemia or necrosis was evaluated by four independent observers using the skin ischaemia necrosis (SKIN) score. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between risk factors and re-operation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      HBOT was started a median of 3 days (range 1-23) after surgery and continued for a median of 12 sessions (range 6-22). The breast SKIN surface area scores (n = 175 observations by the independent observers) improved in 34% (of observations) and the depth scores deteriorated in 42% (both P < 0.01). Both the surface area and depth scores were associated with the need for re-operation: higher scores, reflecting more severe necrosis of the mastectomy flap, were associated with increased need for re-operation. Twenty-nine breasts (58%) recovered without additional operation. Pre-operative radiotherapy (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.4-37.3) and postoperative infection (OR 15.4, 95% CI 2.6-89.7) were risk factors for re-operation in multivariate analyses.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this case series, the surface area of the breast affected by ischaemia decreased during HBOT, and most breasts (58%) did not undergo an additional operation. A randomised control trial is needed to confirm or refute the possibility that HBOT improves outcome in patients with mastectomy flap ischaemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761535/,2022-11-28 02:47:20 AM
Perioperative hyperbaric oxygen treatment and postoperative complications following secondary breast reconstruction after radiotherapy: a case-control study of 45 patients,"Eva L Meier, Stefan Hummelink, Nina Lansdorp, Onno Boonstra, Dietmar Jo Ulrich, Eva L Meier, Stefan Hummelink, Nina Lansdorp, Onno Boonstra, Dietmar Jo Ulrich",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Radiotherapy reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence of breast cancer. As a side-effect, tissue can become hypocellular, hypovascular, and hypoxic and late radiation tissue injury can develop months or years later. Radiotherapy increases the risk of complications following secondary breast reconstruction. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) improves oxygenation of irradiated tissue and induces neovascularisation. This study evaluated whether the incidence of complications following secondary breast reconstruction after radiotherapy is decreased with perioperative HBOT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this retrospective case-control chart review study, patients who underwent perioperative HBOT (n = 15) were compared to lifestyle-matched (n = 15) and radiation damage-matched (n = 15) patients who underwent secondary breast reconstruction without HBOT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The HBOT group had significantly more severe radiation damage of the breast than the lifestyle- and radiation-damage-matched control groups (scoring grade 1-4, mean 3.55 versus 1.75 and 2.89 respectively, P = 0.001). Patients underwent on average 33 sessions of HBOT (18 sessions preoperatively and 15 sessions postoperatively). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the HBOT group, lifestyle-matched group and radiation damage-matched group. Logistic regression analysis showed a lower risk of postoperative complications in patients who underwent HBOT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although the HBOT group had more radiation damage than the control groups, the incidence of postoperative complications was not significantly different. This implied a beneficial effect of HBOT, which was supported by the logistic regression analysis. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn due to the small sample size. Future research is justified, preferably a large randomised controlled trial.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547780/,2022-11-28 02:47:21 AM
Malnutrition screening in outpatients receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy: an opportunity for improvement?,"Oana A Tatucu-Babet, Emma J Ridley, Oana A Tatucu-Babet, Emma J Ridley",2018 Dec 24,"Outpatients who receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may represent a group at significant risk of malnutrition owing to the underlying conditions that are often treated with HBOT (e.g., non-healing diabetic wounds and radiation-induced skin injury). In this issue, See and colleagues provide new, preliminary evidence of the prevalence of malnutrition in a small group of HBOT outpatients treated in an Australian hospital, reporting that approximately one-third of patients receiving HBOT were at risk of malnutrition. To our knowledge, routine malnutrition screening is not available in HBOT centres providing outpatient treatment, which may be a key gap in the nutrition care of these patients. Malnutrition screening was developed to identify those at risk of malnutrition across the healthcare continuum. In the outpatient setting, it is recommended that patients are screened at their first clinic appointment and that screening is repeated when there is clinical concern. Malnutrition screening tools are designed to be quick and simple to complete by trained healthcare staff and include questions relating to appetite, oral intake and recent weight loss. The early identification of patients at risk of malnutrition using validated screening tools enables the appropriate and timely referral of patients to dietetic services for assessment and treatment. Why might malnutrition screening in HBOT services be important? It is well documented that the consequences of malnutrition are systemic, with increased morbidity and mortality attributed to malnutrition. Beyond the detrimental impact of malnutrition to the individual, malnutrition also has significant economic ramifications, with medical costs significantly higher in severely malnourished compared to well-nourished patients. Of particular relevance, malnutrition is associated with impaired and prolonged wound healing. This may influence the effectiveness and success of HBOT treatment, although studies in the area of HBOT and concurrent nutrition therapy are lacking. Furthermore, there are no reliable markers of nutrition status that are easily obtainable in the healthcare setting. In the past, prealbumin (transthyretin) and albumin have been used as surrogate markers of nutritional status. However, these serum proteins are acute-phase proteins and, therefore, are reduced during acute inflammation and infection, making them unreliable indicators of nutrition status. Transferrin, retinol binding protein and C-reactive protein are similarly not recommended as markers of nutrition status and malnutrition. Therefore, the implementation of malnutrition screening may be the most practical and validated method of identifying patients who would benefit from a comprehensive assessment of their nutrition status and provision of nutrition support in the HBOT setting. The assessment of nutrition status involves the collective evaluation of anthropometric data, biochemical markers, clinical symptoms impacting on nutrition (e.g., nausea) and oral intake. Tools such as the subjective global assessment have been developed and validated to assess nutrition status and diagnose malnutrition by trained staff. In contrast to other outpatient services, HBOT presents a unique opportunity to complete both malnutrition screening and engage a relevant dietetic service for nutrition assessment early in the course of treatment. The frequent contact with outpatients would also lend itself well to group nutrition education sessions to address important nutrition information related to wound healing. Although there is a paucity of data to support the use of malnutrition screening and dietetic assessments in HBOT, current best practice guidelines recommend these services in outpatient settings. The implementation of routine malnutrition screening and referral processes to dietetic services warrants consideration in the HBOT outpatient setting. If going down this path, careful consideration of available resources, how referral systems can be incorporated into current procedures as well as partnership with dietetic departments is integral. In the interim, the referral of patients to dietetic departments who are suspected to be at risk of poor wound healing due to nutrition factors and those failing treatment should be considered by treating hyperbaric physicians. Although further research is required to assess the effectiveness of malnutrition screening and nutrition intervention in the HBOT outpatient population, the data by See and colleagues provides an important starting point in unpacking malnutrition risk in this population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517951/,2022-11-28 02:47:22 AM
Diving medicine,"Alfred A Bove, Alfred A Bove",2014 Jun 15,"Exposure to the undersea environment has unique effects on normal physiology and can result in unique disorders that require an understanding of the effects of pressure and inert gas supersaturation on organ function and knowledge of the appropriate therapies, which can include recompression in a hyperbaric chamber. The effects of Boyle's law result in changes in volume of gas-containing spaces when exposed to the increased pressure underwater. These effects can cause middle ear and sinus injury and lung barotrauma due to lung overexpansion during ascent from depth. Disorders related to diving have unique presentations, and an understanding of the high-pressure environment is needed to properly diagnose and manage these disorders. Breathing compressed air underwater results in increased dissolved inert gas in tissues and organs. On ascent after a diving exposure, the dissolved gas can achieve a supersaturated state and can form gas bubbles in blood and tissues, with resulting tissue and organ damage. Decompression sickness can involve the musculoskeletal system, skin, inner ear, brain, and spinal cord, with characteristic signs and symptoms. Usual therapy is recompression in a hyperbaric chamber following well-established protocols. Many recreational diving candidates seek medical clearance for diving, and healthcare providers must be knowledgeable of the environmental exposure and its effects on physiologic function to properly assess individuals for fitness to dive. This review provides a basis for understanding the diving environment and its accompanying disorders and provides a basis for assessment of fitness for diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24869752/,2022-11-28 02:47:23 AM
Odontoideum Bone Revealed by c1-c2 Dislocation of the Cervical Spine during a Diving Accident,"Lassaad Hassini, Mohamed Ali Khalifa, Zeineb Alaya, Mohamed Laaziz Ben Ayeche, Walid Osman, Mourad Mtaoumi, Lassaad Hassini, Mohamed Ali Khalifa, Zeineb Alaya, Mohamed Laaziz Ben Ayeche, Walid Osman, Mourad Mtaoumi",2017 Jul-Aug,"Introduction:
        
      
      Odontoideum bone or the mobile odontoid process is one of the rarest malformations of the cervico-occipital hinge. It exposes to the atlo-axial instability and to the risk of bulbo-medullary compression threatening then the vital and functional prognosis. We report the case of a 16-year-old patient who was the victim of a raod accident resulting in acervical spine injury. Radiological investigation found an odontoideum bone malformation associated with C1C2 dislocation.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      A 16-year-old patient with no medical history had a road accident. Clinical evaluation found an incomplete tetraplegia.The imaging has revealed an atlo-axoidal dislocation with aspinal cord compression. Furthermore, radiological exams relvealed an odentoideum bone. A transcranial traction by a Gardner stirrup was set for 15 days to obtain a progressive reduction of the displacement. A full neurological recovery (FB-FD) was obtained.The patient was then operated to stabilize the reduction. A C1-C2 posterior zygapophyseal arthrodesis was performed. An autograft harvested from the iliac crest was used. Complementary open reduction and fixation of the cervico-occipital hinge was made using lamellar hooks and compression rods. At the 18-month follow-up, the clinical examination found no neurological deficiency and the plain radiography showed a complete fusion of the arthrodesis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Odontoideum bone is a rare and potentially life-threatening malformation. It is most often asymptomatic but symptoms could occur any time after a benign trauma.

Cervical spine immobilisation is only required in drowning patients at high risk of axial loading of the spine,"Ogilvie Thom, Kym Roberts, Peter A Leggat, Susan Devine, Amy E Peden, Richard Franklin, Ogilvie Thom, Kym Roberts, Peter A Leggat, Susan Devine, Amy E Peden, Richard Franklin",2022 Jul 25.,"Objectives:
        
      
      Wave forced impacts are known to result in cervical spine injuries (CSI) and approximately 20% of drownings in Australia occur at the beach. The most common mechanism of injury in studies examining the frequency of CSI in drowning patients is shallow water diving. The aim of the present study was to determine what proportion of CSIs occurring in bodies of water experienced a concomitant drowning injury in a location where wave forced impacts are likely to be an additional risk factor.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic medical records at the Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service EDs, Queensland Ambulance Service case records and Surf Life Saving Queensland data between 1 January 2015 and 21 April 2021 were manually linked. Outcomes recorded included victim demographics, scene information, hospital course and patient disposition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety-one of 574 (15.9%) CSIs occurred in a body of water with risk of drowning. However, only 4 (4.3%) had a simultaneous drowning injury, representing 0.8% (4/483) of drowning presentations. Ten (10.9%) patients reported loss of consciousness, including the four with drowning. The principal mechanism of CSI was a wave forced impact (71/91, 78%). Most injuries occurred at the beach (79/91, 86.8%). Delayed presentation was common (28/91, 31%). A history of axial loading was 100% sensitive when indicating imaging.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The combination of CSI and drowning is uncommon. Cervical spine precautions are only required in drowning patients with signs or a history, or at high risk of, axial loading of the spine. This paper supports the move away from routine cervical spine precautions even in a high-risk population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35878883/,2022-11-28 02:47:24 AM
Pain-Coping Traits of Nontraditional Women Athletes: Relevance to Optimal Treatment and Rehabilitation,"Michael C Meyers, Robert Higgs, Arnold D LeUnes, Anthony E Bourgeois, C Matthew Laurent, Michael C Meyers, Robert Higgs, Arnold D LeUnes, Anthony E Bourgeois, C Matthew Laurent",2015 Oct,"Context:
        
      
      The primary goal of traditional treatment and rehabilitation programs is to safely return athletes to full functional capacity. Nontraditional activities such as rock climbing or rodeo are typically less training structured and coach structured; individualism, self-determination, and autonomy are more prevalent than observed in athletes in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-sponsored sports. The limited research available on nontraditional athletes has provided the athletic trainer little insight into the coping skills and adaptations to stressors that these athletes may bring into the clinical setting, especially among the growing number of women participating in these types of activities. A better understanding of the pain-coping traits of nontraditional competitors would enhance insight and triage procedures while heading off potential athlete-related risk factors in the clinical setting.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To quantify and compare pain-coping traits among individual-sport women athletes participating in nontraditional versus traditional NCAA-structured competition, with relevance to optimal treatment and rehabilitation.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Cross-sectional study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Data collected during each participant's respective group meeting before seasonal activity. Participants or Other Participants : A total of 298 athletes involved in either nontraditional, non-NCAA individual sports (n = 152; mean age = 20.2 ± 1.3 years; downhill skiing, martial arts, rock climbing, rodeo, skydiving, telemark skiing) or traditional NCAA sports (n = 146; mean age = 20.3 ± 1.4 years; equestrian, golf, swimming/diving, tennis, track).
    


          Main outcome measure(s):
        
      
      All participants completed the Sports Inventory for Pain, a sport-specific, self-report instrument that measures pain-coping traits relevant to competition, treatment, and rehabilitation. Trait measures were direct coping, cognitive, catastrophizing, avoidance, body awareness, and total coping response. Data were grouped for analyses by type of athlete (nontraditional, traditional).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found a significant main effect for type of athlete (Wilks' λ F6,291 = 12.922; P = .0001). Nontraditional sport athletes scored lower on direct coping (P = .0001), cognitive (P = .0001), catastrophizing (P = .0001), and total coping response (P = .0001) than traditional athletes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Women participating in nontraditional individual-sport activity revealed less pronounced pain-coping traits than women participating in more coach-structured, traditional NCAA sports. Sport and medical personnel should consider the type of athlete when prescribing training, treatment, and rehabilitation for optimal performance and return to play.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26381368/,2022-11-28 02:47:25 AM

However, there is little knowledge on occurrence and detrimental impacts of marine debris in cetaceans. To partially fill in this gap of knowledge, we aimed to investigate the occurrence and pathologies associated with foreign bodies (FBs) in a large cohort of cetaceans (n = 465) stranded in the Canary Islands. The Canary Islands shelter the greatest cetacean biodiversity in Europe, with up to 30 different species, of which nine are regularly present year around. We found at least one ingested FB in 36 out of 465 (7.74%) studied cetaceans, involving 15 different species, including eight out of the nine (80%) cetacean species present year-round in the Canary Islands. Risso's dolphin was the species most affected, followed by sperm whale, beaked whale and mysticetes. Plastic FB were the most common item found (80.56%). FB was directly associated with death in 13/36 (36.11%) animals. Poor body condition and deep diving behavior were found to be risk factors for FB ingestion, whereas the adult age was a protective factor. To the authors knowledge this is the first study that use statistical analysis to investigate risk and protective factors for FB ingestion.

Dangers beyond drowning: craniomaxillofacial trauma in adult water activities,"Sammy Othman, Samuel Bosco, Jason E Cohn, Tom Shokri, Yadranko Ducic, Sammy Othman, Samuel Bosco, Jason E Cohn, Tom Shokri, Yadranko Ducic",2020 Dec,"Purpose:
        
      
      Water recreation is one of the most popular activities for both fitness and leisure. The dangers of water activities have mostly been examined in the context of drowning and general bodily injuries. Despite the existing research, little is known about adult maxillofacial injuries in these settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We accessed the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System in order to identify adult patients presenting to emergency departments with traumatic maxillofacial injuries secondary to a water-based sport or activity over the most recent 10-year period (2009-2018). Data collected included demographical information, anatomical location, mechanism of injury, and visit circumstances, as well as visit disposition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1350 total patients were identified as appropriate for study inclusion. Young, Caucasian male adults were the most common age group to present with maxillofacial injuries secondary to water sport activities. Surfing and water skiing were associated with lacerations, while diving board incidents posed a higher fracture risk. Patients participating in all water activities were more likely to be treated and released rather than admitted.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There appears to be a distinct pattern profile for individuals who sustain maxillofacial trauma while participating in water sports: young, Caucasian males in particular. Additionally, specific activities may be associated with varying injury types. The results of this study may increase interest in legislature and patient counseling when seeking such activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601833/,2022-11-28 02:47:27 AM
"Marine Scorpaenidae Envenomation in Travelers: Epidemiology, Management, and Prevention","James H Diaz, James H Diaz",2015 Jul-Aug,"Background:
        
      
      The Scorpaenidae are a large family of venomous marine fish that include scorpionfish, lionfish, and stonefish. Although most stonefish are confined to the Indo-Pacific, scorpionfish are distributed in the tropics worldwide, and two species of Indo-Pacific lionfish were inadvertently introduced into the Eastern Atlantic in the 1990s. Since then, lionfish have invaded shallow reef systems in the Eastern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. All of these regions are popular travel destinations for beachcombing, fishing, swimming, and scuba diving-recreational activities that increase risks of Scorpaenidae envenomation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To meet the objectives of describing species-specific presenting clinical manifestations, diagnostic and treatment strategies, and outcomes of Scorpaenidae envenomation in travelers, Internet search engines were queried with the key words.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Well-conducted, retrospective epidemiological investigations of Scorpaenidae envenomation case series concluded: (1) most cases occurred in young adult male vacationers visiting endemic regions; (2) victims sought medical attention for pain control within 2 hours of injury and presented with intense pain, edema, and erythema in affected extremities; (3) systemic manifestations and surgical interventions were relatively uncommon following initial management with hot water soaks and parenteral analgesics; (4) all cases required tetanus prophylaxis; deeply penetrating, lacerated, and necrotic wounds required antibiotic prophylaxis; and (5) equine Fab stonefish antivenom does have antigen-neutralizing cross-reactivities with both Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Scorpaenidae species and is indicated in severe scorpionfish and stonefish envenomation worldwide.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Travel medicine practitioners should counsel their patients about Scorpaenidae envenomation risks in endemic regions and maintain a high index of suspicion regarding Scorpaenidae envenomation in all travelers returning from tropical beach and ocean holidays and reporting painful fish sting injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25884785/,2022-11-28 02:47:28 AM
"Distribution, ecological risk, and source analysis of heavy metals in recent beach sediments of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt","Hamdy El Sayed Nour, Hamdy El Sayed Nour",2019 Aug 7,"To study the distribution of the concentrations and the sources of pollutants and their environmental assessment in the Sharm El-Sheikh coastal area, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, and Co concentrations were analyzed in the beach sediments of Sharm El-Sheikh harbor and Sharm El-Maya bay by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results revealed that Sharm El-Sheikh harbor has higher concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ni, and Cd than in Sharm El-Maya bay. Meanwhile, the environmental pollution indicators as enrichment factors, metal pollution index, contamination factors, sediments pollution index, geo-accumulation index, ecological risk factor, and the potential contamination index reported that Sharm El-Sheikh harbor has a higher degree of pollution (MPI = 43.4) than Sharm El-Maya bay (MPI = 38.2). Moreover, both of the studied areas have shown very high contamination of Cd and moderate to high contamination of Pb, Mn, Cu, and Zn. Furthermore, the concentrations of Mn, Cu, Ni, and Cd in the studied area are higher than those in the coasts of Hurghada, Shalateen, Red Sea of Saudi Arabia, and the Russian Caspian Sea. The main sources of the metals in the studied area are the human impacts as tourist activities, boat navigation, large numbers of anchored tourist boats, diving operations, and car fuel combustion products. In addition, the natural weathering of Gabal El-Safra and basement rocks can be counted as natural sources of metals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31392419/,2022-11-28 02:47:28 AM
How effectively do horizontal and vertical response strategies of long-finned pilot whales reduce sound exposure from naval sonar?,"Paul J Wensveen, Alexander M von Benda-Beckmann, Michael A Ainslie, Frans-Peter A Lam, Petter H Kvadsheim, Peter L Tyack, Patrick J O Miller, Paul J Wensveen, Alexander M von Benda-Beckmann, Michael A Ainslie, Frans-Peter A Lam, Petter H Kvadsheim, Peter L Tyack, Patrick J O Miller",2015 May,"The behaviour of a marine mammal near a noise source can modulate the sound exposure it receives. We demonstrate that two long-finned pilot whales both surfaced in synchrony with consecutive arrivals of multiple sonar pulses. We then assess the effect of surfacing and other behavioural response strategies on the received cumulative sound exposure levels and maximum sound pressure levels (SPLs) by modelling realistic spatiotemporal interactions of a pilot whale with an approaching source. Under the propagation conditions of our model, some response strategies observed in the wild were effective in reducing received levels (e.g. movement perpendicular to the source's line of approach), but others were not (e.g. switching from deep to shallow diving; synchronous surfacing after maximum SPLs). Our study exemplifies how simulations of source-whale interactions guided by detailed observational data can improve our understanding about motivations behind behaviour responses observed in the wild (e.g., reducing sound exposure, prey movement).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25795075/,2022-11-28 02:47:29 AM

"Aquatic Activity-Related Craniofacial Injuries Presenting to United States Emergency Departments, 2010 to 2019","Stephen C Yang, Drake G Johnson, Susan H Keefe, Brian T Bast, Stephen C Yang, Drake G Johnson, Susan H Keefe, Brian T Bast",2021 Dec,"Purpose:
        
      
      Aquatic activities are some of the most widely enjoyed sports and recreational activities in the United States. This study aimed to analyze the risks and types of craniofacial injuries associated with various aquatic activities.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively analyzed aquatic activity-related craniofacial injuries between 2010 and 2019 using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database. Aquatic activities included swimming, diving, surfing, water skiing, and water tubing. Risks and types of craniofacial injuries were analyzed according to the types of aquatic activities, age, and sex.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 48,112 patients with aquatic activity-related injuries, 9,529 (19.8%) had craniofacial injuries. In decreasing order of frequency, the causes of craniofacial injuries were swimming (79.6%), diving (7.5%), surfing (5.9%), water skiing (3.6%), and water tubing (3.5%). The proportion of craniofacial injuries among all injuries was higher in males than in females (22.8 vs 16.3%, P < .001), and decreased with age: 27.7% in 0 to 5 years, 21.5% in 6 to 11 years, 20.5% in 12 to 17 years, and 15.2% in ≥18 years (P < .001). Additionally, the proportion of craniofacial injuries was highest in diving (38.7%), and lowest in swimming (18.1%, P < .001). The male-to-female ratio in the proportion of patients with craniofacial injuries was highest in swimming at 1.42, and close to unity (0.97-1.13) in other activities. The most common type of craniofacial injury was laceration (43.5%), followed by concussion/internal organ injury (38.9%), contusion/abrasion (11.3%), and fracture (3%). Among all craniofacial injuries, the proportion of craniofacial fractures was highest in water tubing (8.5%) and lowest in swimming (2.2%, P < .001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Craniofacial injuries are a frequent cause of morbidity related to aquatic activities. Substantial variability exists in the risk and pattern of craniofacial injuries depending on the type of activity, age, and sex. These findings may aid in instituting educational programs and preventive measures against aquatic activity-related craniofacial injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34453914/,2022-11-28 02:47:32 AM
Injuries and Fatalities Related to Freediving: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Michael F Allen, Deborah E Allen, Michael F Allen, Deborah E Allen",2022 Oct 16,"This case report and literature review aim to explore the range of injuries sustained in the sport of freediving. The case report involves a 37-year-old patient who sustained a pneumothorax secondary to freediving. We conducted the literature review to analyse the injuries associated with freediving. We used the combination of search terms 'freediving"", ""injuries"", and ""breath-hold diving"" on the database PubMed®. A total of 40 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The search revealed a wide range of ophthalmological, pulmonary, neurological, ear, nose, and throat injuries, along with several fatalities. Freediving is a sport performed in extreme environments and, if undertaken by inexperienced, untrained, or competition divers, can lead to severe injury or even death. However, the risk of damage can be reduced by performing it responsibly with the appropriate training and by using proper safety measures.

Do skin rash and cutis marmorata stem from lamellar bodies within the skin?,"Ran Arieli, Ran Arieli",2018 Jun 30,"Cutis marmorata (CM) manifests as bluish-red spots on the skin following decompression. These are often itchy or painful to touch, and appear half to one hour after surfacing. The pathogenesis of skin lesions in decompression illness (DCI) remains unresolved. The common belief has been that bubbles that shunted to the arterial circulation reached the skin and clogged blood vessels. An alternative explanation from studies in which air was injected into the internal carotid artery of swine is that arterial bubbles at the brain stem disturb the control of skin blood flow, causing CM. Other brain syndromes have also been seen to cause CM. It was suggested that bubbles affecting the brain stem result in the release of neuropeptides in the skin which control vasodilatation and vasoconstriction. However, this does not explain the inflammation in the skin lesions, with red blood cells, haemorrhage and neutrophil infiltrates. The percentage of right-to-left circulatory shunts in divers who suffered CM was 77% compared with 28% in divers with no record of CM, a finding which supports either of these explanations. Another study in swine concluded that there was ""strong evidence to support autochthonous bubbles as the etiology of skin lesions"". Lesions appeared without right-to-left shunting. Skin thickness from the squamous keratin to the dermis increased by 10% in the affected areas. The lesions showed congestion, haemorrhage and neutrophil infiltrates. Superficial counter-diffusion as a cause of CM, the increased risk of CM in a dry as opposed to a wet dive and the prevalence of CM in proximity to subcutaneous fat (which acts as a nitrogen reservoir), all support an autochthonous origin. Decompression bubbles can develop and expand only from pre-existing gas micronuclei. It is known that nanobubbles form spontaneously when a smooth hydrophobic surface is submerged in water containing dissolved gas. We have shown that these nanobubbles are the gas micronuclei underlying decompression bubbles and DCI. After decompression, bubbles evolved at definite hydrophobic sites composed of the lung surfactant dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Nanobubbles are formed on the surface of these lamellar layers of phospholipids, and on decompression expand into venous and arterial bubbles. Lamellar bodies of phospholipids produced in the granular layer of the skin are used for the formation of a hydrophobic barrier at the cornified layer. We suggest that the hydrophobic layers in the skin may be the site at which bubbles develop from nanobubbles and cause CM, just as occurs at the active hydrophobic spots on the luminal aspect of a blood vessel. This is the reason no bubbles were observed in the skin microcirculation. Unlike bubbles on the inner wall of venous blood vessels, which are supplied with high quantities of nitrogen from the incoming venous blood, the expansion of skin bubbles will be limited due to a low supply of nitrogen (possibly from the nearby subcutaneous fat). Therefore, skin bubbles should be small and have a short life span, which may be why they have hitherto remained undetected. The sensitivity of some divers to CM and its localization to specific skin areas may be related to individual variability in the lamellar bodies and phospholipid skin barriers. Support for the present hypothesis may be found in the observation in some cases (though not all) of the movement of gas under the skin by means of echography (Balestra C, personal communication, 2018). CM is more frequent in female divers, and more so in subtropical than in cold European waters (van Ooij P-JAM, personal communication, 2018). This may be explained by women having more subcutaneous fat than men, coupled with the higher skin perfusion (and nitrogen loading) in warm water. This suggestion of possible autochthonous bubble formation in the skin does not exclude other causes, but may open a window for further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888386/,2022-11-28 02:47:33 AM
Addressing the taboo of medical error through IGBOs: I got burnt once!,"Anda Dumitrescu, C Anthony Ryan, Anda Dumitrescu, C Anthony Ryan",2014 Apr,"Background:
        
      
      An I Got Burnt Once (IGBO) is a near-miss or actual clinical event, related to patient safety, that leaves a lasting impact on the health professional (HP) involved. The purpose of this study was to collect and categorize IGBOs from a variety of pediatric HPs and to determine whether the individual's clinical practice was altered as a result.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Semistructured interviews involved recollection of an IGBO and subsequent changes in clinical practice. The IGBOs were classified into one of the seven Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) roles and outcome of the event.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 38 pediatric HPs approached (25 doctors and 13 female nurses), 35 recalled an IGBO. Most (74 %) were classified to the CanMEDS Medical Expert role (with subcategorization into diagnostics (37 %), treatment (34 %), and clinical management (31 %) followed by communicator (14 %) and collaborator (12 %) roles). Half (55 %) of the respondents considered the IGBO event to be potentially life threatening event to the patient, resulting in no harm (63 %), disability (14 %), and fatality in 17 % of the cases. Most respondents (92 %) stated that IGBOs affected their medical practice for months and sometimes years after the event.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most practitioners can recall an IGBO in their clinical practice. IGBOs may be a potential source of medical risk avoidance and reduction strategies, and worthy of further investigation by ""deep dives"" or root cause analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24240665/,2022-11-28 02:47:34 AM
Impact of Fire Suit Ensembles on Firefighter PAH Exposures as Assessed by Skin Deposition and Urinary Biomarkers,"Håkan Wingfors, Jenny Rattfelt Nyholm, Roger Magnusson, Cecilia Hammar Wijkmark, Håkan Wingfors, Jenny Rattfelt Nyholm, Roger Magnusson, Cecilia Hammar Wijkmark",2018 Feb 13,"Over the past 10 years, a number of safety measures for reducing firefighters' exposure to combustion particles have been introduced in Sweden. The most important measure was the reduction in the time firefighters wear suits and handle contaminated equipment after turn-outs involving smoke diving. This study was divided into two parts, those being to investigate the level of protection obtained by multiple garment layers and to assess exposure during a standardized smoke diving exercise. First, realistic work protection factors (WPFs) were calculated by comparing air concentrations of the full suite of gaseous and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) inside and outside structural ensembles, including jacket and thick base layer, during a tough fire extinguishing exercise using wood as the fuel. Second, during a standardized smoke diving exercise, exposure was assessed by measuring PAH skin deposition and levels of eight urinary PAH metabolites in 20 volunteer student firefighters before and after the exercise. The average WPF for the sum of 22 PAHs was 146 ± 33 suggesting a relatively high protective capacity but also indicating a substantial enrichment of contaminants with a risk of prolonged dermal exposure. Accordingly, in the second exercise, the median levels of skin-deposited Σ14-PAHs and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene significantly increased 5-fold (21 to 99 ng/wipe) and 8-fold (0.14 to 1.1 µmol mol-1 creatinine), respectively, post exposure. Among the PAH metabolites investigated, 1-hydroxypyrene proved to be the most useful indicator of exposure, with significantly elevated urinary levels at both 6 h and 20 h after the exercise and with the strongest correlation to dermal exposure. Metabolites from two-ring and three-ring PAHs were eliminated faster while levels of 3-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene did not meet the detection criteria. The results from correlation studies indicated that dermal uptake was a major route of exposure in accordance with previous findings. To summarize, this study shows that some of the newly adopted protective measures were correctly implemented, and should continue to be followed and be more widely adopted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29236997/,2022-11-28 02:47:35 AM

Wilderness medicine,"Douglas G Sward, Brad L Bennett, Douglas G Sward, Brad L Bennett",2014,"Background:
        
      
      Human activity in wilderness areas has increased globally in recent decades, leading to increased risk of injury and illness. Wilderness medicine has developed in response to both need and interest.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The field of wilderness medicine encompasses many areas of interest. Some focus on special circumstances (such as avalanches) while others have a broader scope (such as trauma care). Several core areas of key interest within wilderness medicine are discussed in this study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Wilderness medicine is characterized by remote and improvised care of patients with routine or exotic illnesses or trauma, limited resources and manpower, and delayed evacuation to definitive care. Wilderness medicine is developing rapidly and draws from the breadth of medical and surgical subspecialties as well as the technical fields of mountaineering, climbing, and diving. Research, epidemiology, and evidence-based guidelines are evolving. A hallmark of this field is injury prevention and risk mitigation. The range of topics encompasses high-altitude cerebral edema, decompression sickness, snake envenomation, lightning injury, extremity trauma, and gastroenteritis.

Diving and antidepressants,"Abraham L Querido, Abraham L Querido",2017 Dec,"Psychoactive drugs pose a risk to both the diver and his or her buddy. Little is known about the safety of diving with antidepressants. Amongst the potential interactions with the diving environment are: somnolence; convulsions; a bleeding tendency (potentially worsening decompression illness, DCI), alterations to glucose metabolism and psychiatric side effects. Fluoxetine may potentially reduce the inflammatory process associated with DCI. This article presents guidelines for recreational diving in combination with antidepressants. These guidelines were endorsed at a meeting of the Dutch Association for Diving Medicine in 2015 and are solely based on 'expert' opinion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29241236/,2022-11-28 02:47:37 AM
"Human forced expiratory noise. Origin, apparatus and possible diagnostic applications","Vladimir I Korenbaum, Irina A Pochekutova, Anatoly E Kostiv, Veronika V Malaeva, Maria A Safronova, Oksana I Kabantsova, Svetlana N Shin, Vladimir I Korenbaum, Irina A Pochekutova, Anatoly E Kostiv, Veronika V Malaeva, Maria A Safronova, Oksana I Kabantsova, Svetlana N Shin",2020 Dec,"Forced expiratory (FE) noise is a powerful bioacoustic signal containing information on human lung biomechanics. FE noise is attributed to a broadband part and narrowband components-forced expiratory wheezes (FEWs). FE respiratory noise is composed by acoustic and hydrodynamic mechanisms. An origin of the most powerful mid-frequency FEWs (400-600 Hz) is associated with the 0th-3rd levels of bronchial tree in terms of Weibel [(2009). Swiss Med. Wkly. 139(27-28), 375-386], whereas high-frequency FEWs (above 600 Hz) are attributed to the 2nd-6th levels of bronchial tree. The laboratory prototype of the apparatus is developed, which includes the electret microphone sensor with stethoscope head, a laptop with external sound card, and specially developed software. An analysis of signals by the new method, including FE time in the range from 200 to 2000 Hz and band-pass durations and energies in the 200-Hz bands evaluation, is applied instead of FEWs direct measures. It is demonstrated experimentally that developed FE acoustic parameters correspond to basic indices of lung function evaluated by spirometry and body plethysmography and may be even more sensitive to some respiratory deviations. According to preliminary experimental results, the developed technique may be considered as a promising instrument for acoustic monitoring human lung function in extreme conditions, including diving and space flights. The developed technique eliminates the contact of the sensor with the human oral cavity, which is characteristic for spirometry and body plethysmography. It reduces the risk of respiratory cross-contamination, especially during outpatient and field examinations, and may be especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33379875/,2022-11-28 02:47:38 AM
Loeys-Dietz Syndrome,"Bart L Loeys, Harry C Dietz, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Bart L Loeys, Harry C Dietz, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is characterized by vascular findings (cerebral, thoracic, and abdominal arterial aneurysms and/or dissections), skeletal manifestations (pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum, scoliosis, joint laxity, arachnodactyly, talipes equinovarus, cervical spine malformation and/or instability), craniofacial features (widely spaced eyes, strabismus, bifid uvula / cleft palate, and craniosynostosis that can involve any sutures), and cutaneous findings (velvety and translucent skin, easy bruising, and dystrophic scars). Individuals with LDS are predisposed to widespread and aggressive arterial aneurysms and pregnancy-related complications including uterine rupture and death. Individuals with LDS can show a strong predisposition for allergic/inflammatory disease including asthma, eczema, and reactions to food or environmental allergens. There is also an increased incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation including eosinophilic esophagitis and gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Wide variation in the distribution and severity of clinical features can be seen in individuals with LDS, even among affected individuals within a family who have the same pathogenic variant.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of LDS is established in individuals based on characteristic clinical findings in the proband and family members and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Important considerations when managing cardiovascular features of LDS: aortic dissection can occur at smaller aortic diameters and at younger ages than observed in Marfan syndrome; vascular disease is not limited to the aortic root; angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, or other medications are used to reduce hemodynamic stress; and aneurysms are amenable to early and aggressive surgical intervention. Surgical fixation of cervical spine instability may be necessary to prevent spinal cord damage. Treatment is standard for clubfeet and severe pes planus. Management by a craniofacial team is preferred for treatment of cleft palate and craniosynostosis. Standard treatment for allergic complications with consideration of referral to an allergy/immunology specialist in severe cases. Careful and aggressive refraction and visual correction is mandatory in young children at risk for amblyopia. Hernias tend to recur after surgical intervention. A supporting mesh can be used during surgical repair to minimize recurrence risk. Optimal management of pneumothorax to prevent recurrence may require chemical or surgical pleurodesis or surgical removal of pulmonary blebs.
    

Prevention of secondary complications: Consider subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) prophylaxis in those undergoing dental work or other procedures expected to contaminate the bloodstream with bacteria. Because of high risk for cervical spine instability, a flexion/extension x-ray of the cervical spine should be performed prior to intubation or any other procedure involving manipulation of the neck.
    

Surveillance: All individuals with LDS require echocardiography at frequent intervals to monitor the status of the ascending aorta; the frequency of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) evaluation to image the entire arterial tree depends on clinical findings. Individuals with cervical spine instability and severe or progressive scoliosis should be followed by an orthopedist.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system including routine use of decongestants or triptan medications for the management of migraine headache; activities that cause joint injury or pain; for individuals at risk for recurrent pneumothorax, breathing against a resistance (e.g., playing a brass instrument) or positive pressure ventilation (e.g., SCUBA diving).
    

Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the proband is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify genetic status of at-risk family members; if the pathogenic variant is not known, relatives at risk should be evaluated for signs of LDS, including echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging if findings suggest LDS or if findings were subtle in the index case.
    

Pregnancy management: Pregnancy and the postpartum period can be dangerous for women with LDS because of increased risk of aortic dissection/rupture and uterine rupture. Increased frequency of aortic imaging is recommended, both during pregnancy and in the weeks following delivery.
    

Therapies under investigation: The safety and efficacy of angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) has not been addressed for persons with LDS in a clinical trial setting, but ARBs have proven safe and comparable or superior to beta blockers in treating other vascular connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      LDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 25% of individuals diagnosed with LDS have an affected parent; approximately 75% of probands have LDS as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with LDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and the disorder. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for LDS is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301312/,2022-11-28 02:47:38 AM
"How do the new Olympic sports compare with the traditional Olympic sports? Injury and illness at the 2018 Youth Olympic Summer Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina","Kathrin Steffen, Torbjørn Soligard, Margo Mountjoy, Ignacio Dallo, Alan Maximiliano Gessara, Hernan Giuria, Leonel Perez Alamino, Joaquin Rodriguez, Natalia Salmina, Daniel Veloz, Richard Budgett, Lars Engebretsen, Kathrin Steffen, Torbjørn Soligard, Margo Mountjoy, Ignacio Dallo, Alan Maximiliano Gessara, Hernan Giuria, Leonel Perez Alamino, Joaquin Rodriguez, Natalia Salmina, Daniel Veloz, Richard Budgett, Lars Engebretsen",2020 Feb,"Objective:
        
      
      To describe injuries and illnesses across traditional and new sports among the participating athletes of the Buenos Aires 2018 Youth Olympic Summer Games (BA YOG) (6-18 October 2018).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We recorded the daily number of athlete injuries and illnesses (1) through the reporting of all National Olympic Committee (NOC) medical teams and (2) in the polyclinic and medical venues manned by the BA YOG 2018 medical staff.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 3.984 athletes from 206 NOCs were observed. NOCs and BA YOG 2018 medical staff reported 619 injuries and 334 illnesses, equalling 15.5 injuries and 8.4 illnesses per 100 athletes over the 13-day period. The eight new sports on the Youth Olympic programme (futsal, beach handball, karate, roller speed skating, kitesurfing, BMX freestyle, climbing and break dancing) fell in between the other sports with respect to injury and illness risk. Injury incidence was highest in rugby (43% of all rugby players), followed by boxing (33%) and badminton (24%), and lowest in swimming, archery, roller speed skating, equestrian, climbing and rowing (<5%). The highest incidences of illness were recorded in golf (20%), followed by triathlon (16%), beach volleyball and diving (both 14%). Of the illnesses, 50% affected the respiratory system and 15% the gastrointestinal system. Injury and illness incidences varied between continents with athletes representing Europe having significantly fewer injuries and illnesses compared with other continents, apart from a similar illness incidence to Asian athletes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The overall injury incidence of 15.5 injuries per 100 athletes was higher, while the overall illness incidence of 8.4 illnesses per 100 athletes was similar to previous youth and Olympic Games. The new sports did not differ significantly compared with the other sports with respect to injury and illness risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31796464/,2022-11-28 02:47:39 AM
Utility of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging for detecting changes in the femoral head in divers with hip pain at risk for dysbaric osteonecrosis,"Tsung-Tai Lin, Cheng-Chuan Hu, Yi-Chih Hsu, Chih-Chien Wang, Shih-Wei Chiang, Chao-Ying Wang, Wei-Chou Chang, Guo-Shu Huang, Tsung-Tai Lin, Cheng-Chuan Hu, Yi-Chih Hsu, Chih-Chien Wang, Shih-Wei Chiang, Chao-Ying Wang, Wei-Chou Chang, Guo-Shu Huang",2022 Jan,"Background:
        
      
      Ischemia before the development of dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON) in femoral heads has never been investigated. We assessed whether quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) could detect dysbaric changes in divers with hip pain.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This IRB-approved exploratory study recruited 17 divers [9 with hip pain (Group 1); 8 asymptomatic (Group 2)] with normal findings on radiographs and conventional magnetic resonance imaging scans were age-, gender- and body-mass-index matched to 17 non-divers as controls (Group 1C, 2C). Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and MRS spectra were obtained from regions/voxels of interest on the femoral heads of all subjects. LCModel was used to determine water content, lipid composition, and the unsaturation index in bone marrow. Mann-Whitney non-parametric test was used to compare results of quantitative MRS and ADCs of ipsilateral femoral heads between divers and controls.
    


          Results:
        
      
      MRS of the ipsilateral femoral heads revealed higher water (peak: 4.7 ppm) content, lower total lipid fraction (TLF), and higher unsaturation index (UI) of lipids in Group 1 than in Group 2 (water: P=0.040; UI: P=0.022) and Group 1C (water: P=0.027; TLF: P=0.039; UI: P=0.009). In contrast, femoral head ADCs were comparable between divers and controls. Five out of nine symptomatic divers were contacted for follow-up MRS and DWI studies, and the mean difference in water content in the femoral heads of patients with osteonecrosis was also higher than that in patients with symptom relief (osteonecrosis: 0.077±0.130 vs. symptom relief: 0.003±0.010).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Dysbaric change in the femoral heads of divers with hip pain can be detected using quantitative MRS, which reveals increases in water content and UI of lipids, and a decrease in TLF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993059/,2022-11-28 02:47:40 AM
Adapting classic paradigms to analyze alterations of shoal-wide behavior in early-life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) - A case study with fluoxetine,"Lukas Frese, Thomas Braunbeck, Lukas Frese, Thomas Braunbeck",2022 Nov 21,"Given the strong increase in prescription of neuroactive pharmaceuticals, neurotoxicity has received growing concern in science and the public. Regulatory requirements stimulated the development of new methods to evaluate the risk of neurotoxic substances for humans and the environment, and, with respect to potential damage to aquatic ecosystems, a variety of behavior-based assays have been proposed for neurotoxicity testing, most of which, however, are restricted to changes in the behavior of individual fish. Since many fish species form shoals under natural conditions, this may cause important aspects of behavior to be overlooked and there is a need for behavior assays integrating individual behavior with behavior of the entire swarm. In order to combine more environmentally realistic sub-chronic exposure scenarios with undistorted social behavior and animal welfare considerations, two behavioral assays are proposed that might be integrated into early-life stage toxicity studies according to OECD TG 210, which are commonly run for a multitude of regulations: To this end, protocols for a novel tank test and a predator response assay were adapted to also record the behavior of free-swimming zebrafish (Danio rerio) juveniles within shoals. Comparisons of the diving response (novel tank) or the shoal's coherence and position relative to the stimulus (predator) with control groups allow conclusions about the anxiety state of the fish, which might well have an impact on survival chances in the wild. As a model substance, the antidepressant fluoxetine ((RS)-N-Methyl-3-phenyl-3-(4-trifluoromethylphenoxy)propylamine) produced adverse effects down to concentrations three orders of magnitude below the EC10 from acute fish embryo toxicity tests according to OECD TG 236. With the integration of such behavior tests into OECD TG 210, important population-relevant information on potential neurotoxicity can be collected without increasing the number of experimental animals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36423854/,2022-11-28 02:47:40 AM
Pre- and post-operative clinical findings of tympanomastoid surgery in female divers (Haenyeo) of Jeju Island with chronic otitis media,"Se-Hyung Kim, Se-Hyung Kim",2015,"Conclusions:
        
      
      A tympanomastoid surgery can control chronic otitis media (COM) and improve hearing effectively in Jeju women divers (Haenyeo) without any complications.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the long-term results of tympanomastoid surgery in Haenyeo patients with COM to determine any link between their diving behavior and COM.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The medical records of 207 COM patients who underwent tympanomastoid surgery were reviewed for demographic characteristics, etiologic analyses, pre- and post-operative hearing levels, types of tympanomastoid surgery with ossiculoplasty, and post-operative complications. The patients were divided into a 'Haenyeo COM group' of 98 patients and a 'general COM group' of 109, and followed up for at least 3 years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the audiologic study, the Haenyeo COM group showed a relatively larger pre-operative air-bone gap than the general COM group. There were no statistically significant differences in middle ear swab culture results, the rates of re-perforation of the tympanic membrane or re-operation, or the risk of post-operative complications between the two groups. However, the possibility of COM accompanying cholesteatoma was higher and the canal wall down mastoidectomy was more frequently performed in the Haenyeo COM group (both p < 0.05).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224115/,2022-11-28 02:47:41 AM
Injury rate in a helicopter underwater escape trainer (HUET) from 2005-2012,"Christopher J Brooks, Conor V MacDonald, Peter N A Gibbs, Christopher J Brooks, Conor V MacDonald, Peter N A Gibbs",2014 Aug,"Background:
        
      
      Helicopter underwater escape training (HUET) carries a potential for injury and this paper identifies the injury rate.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A marine survival training school registry of all students trained between 2005-2012 in HUET and the coinciding accident records were examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 8902 students trained in a helicopter underwater escape simulator for a total of 59,245 underwater escapes. There were 40 cases where only first-aid was required and 3 serious injuries (a laceration requiring 5 sutures, 1 dislocated shoulder, and 1 water aspiration requiring hospitalization). There were no deaths and no problems reported with using the Emergency Breathing System (EBS) or Air Pocket. Of the injuries, 11 were due to the student using a poor escape technique. The overall probability of injury was 0.74 per 1000 ascents.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In HUET training, there is a very low injury rate with almost no significant severity. Although not scientifically proven, this would suggest that the low incident rate is due to good medical screening and the attention given by instructors to anxious students. Compared to other training such as diving, parachute jumping, and submarine escape training, the rate of injury was considerably lower.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25199130/,2022-11-28 02:47:42 AM
Swimming-Induced Pulmonary Edema: Pathophysiology and Risk Reduction With Sildenafil,"Richard E Moon, Stefanie D Martina, Dionne F Peacher, Jennifer F Potter, Tracy E Wester, Anne D Cherry, Michael J Natoli, Claire E Otteni, Dawn N Kernagis, William D White, John J Freiberger, Richard E Moon, Stefanie D Martina, Dionne F Peacher, Jennifer F Potter, Tracy E Wester, Anne D Cherry, Michael J Natoli, Claire E Otteni, Dawn N Kernagis, William D White, John J Freiberger",2016 Mar 8,"Background:
        
      
      Swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs during swimming or scuba diving, often in young individuals with no predisposing conditions, and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressures are higher in SIPE-susceptible individuals during submerged exercise than in the general population and are reduced by sildenafil.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Ten study subjects with a history of SIPE (mean age, 41.6 years) and 20 control subjects (mean age, 36.2 years) were instrumented with radial artery and pulmonary artery catheters and performed moderate cycle ergometer exercise for 6 to 7 minutes while submersed in 20°C water. SIPE-susceptible subjects repeated the exercise 150 minutes after oral administration of 50 mg sildenafil. Work rate and mean arterial pressure during exercise were similar in controls and SIPE-susceptible subjects. Average o2 and cardiac output in controls and SIPE-susceptible subjects were: o2 2.42 L·min(-1) versus 1.95 L·min(-1), P=0.2; and cardiac output 17.9 L·min(-1) versus 13.8 L·min(-1), P=0.01. Accounting for differences in cardiac output between groups, mean pulmonary artery pressure at cardiac output=13.8 L·min(-1) was 22.5 mm Hg in controls versus 34.0 mm Hg in SIPE-susceptible subjects (P=0.004), and the corresponding pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 11.0 mm Hg versus 18.8 mm Hg (P=0.028). After sildenafil, there were no statistically significant differences in mean pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure between SIPE-susceptible subjects and controls.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These observations confirm that SIPE is a form of hemodynamic pulmonary edema. The reduction in pulmonary vascular pressures after sildenafil with no adverse effect on exercise hemodynamics suggests that it may be useful in SIPE prevention.

Association of Predominantly Peripheral Lesions on Ultra-Widefield Imaging and the Risk of Diabetic Retinopathy Worsening Over Time,"Dennis M Marcus, Paolo S Silva, Danni Liu, Lloyd Paul Aiello, Andrew Antoszyk, Michael Elman, Scott Friedman, Adam R Glassman, Joseph M Googe, Lee Merrill Jampol, Daniel F Martin, Michele Melia, Carin M Preston, Charles C Wykoff, Jennifer K Sun, DRCR Retina Network",2022 Oct 1,"Importance:
        
      
      Ultra-widefield (UWF) imaging improves the ability to identify peripheral diabetic retinopathy (DR) lesions compared with standard imaging. Whether detection of predominantly peripheral lesions (PPLs) better predicts rates of disease worsening over time is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether PPLs identified on UWF imaging are associated with increased disease worsening beyond the risk associated with baseline Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) score.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This cohort study was a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal observational study conducted at 37 US and Canadian sites with 388 participants enrolled between February and December 2015. At baseline and annually through 4 years, 200° UWF-color images were obtained and graded for DRSS at a reading center. Baseline UWF-color and UWF-fluorescein angiography (FA) images were evaluated for the presence of PPL. Data were analyzed from May 2020 to June 2022.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Treatment of DR or diabetic macular edema was at investigator discretion.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Predominantly peripheral lesions were defined as DR lesions with a greater extent outside vs inside the 7 standard ETDRS fields. Primary outcome was disease worsening defined as worsening 2 steps or more on the DRSS or receipt of DR treatment. Analyses were adjusted for baseline DRSS score and correlation between 2 study eyes of the same participant.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data for 544 study eyes with nonproliferative DR (NPDR) were analyzed (182 [50%] female participants; median age, 62 years; 68% White). The 4-year disease worsening rates were 45% for eyes with baseline mild NPDR, 40% for moderate NPDR, 26% for moderately severe NPDR, and 43% for severe NPDR. Disease worsening was not associated with color PPL at baseline (present vs absent: 38% vs 43%; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.08; P = .13) but was associated with FA PPL at baseline (present vs absent: 50% vs 31%; HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.25-2.36; P < .001).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Although no association was identified with color PPL, presence of FA PPL was associated with greater risk of disease worsening over 4 years, independent of baseline DRSS score. These results suggest that use of UWF-FA to evaluate retinas peripheral to standard ETDRS fields may improve the ability to predict disease worsening in NPDR eyes. These findings support use of UWF-FA for future DR staging systems and clinical care to more accurately determine prognosis in NPDR eyes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35980608/,2022-11-28 02:47:43 AM
Seeing is believing: information content and behavioural response to visual and chemical cues,"Francisco G Gonzálvez, Miguel A Rodríguez-Gironés, Francisco G Gonzálvez, Miguel A Rodríguez-Gironés",2013 May 22,"Predator avoidance and foraging often pose conflicting demands. Animals can decrease mortality risk searching for predators, but searching decreases foraging time and hence intake. We used this principle to investigate how prey should use information to detect, assess and respond to predation risk from an optimal foraging perspective. A mathematical model showed that solitary bees should increase flower examination time in response to predator cues and that the rate of false alarms should be negatively correlated with the relative value of the flower explored. The predatory ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, and the harmless ant, Polyrhachis dives, differ in the profile of volatiles they emit and in their visual appearance. As predicted, the solitary bee Nomia strigata spent more time examining virgin flowers in presence of predator cues than in their absence. Furthermore, the proportion of flowers rejected decreased from morning to noon, as the relative value of virgin flowers increased. In addition, bees responded differently to visual and chemical cues. While chemical cues induced bees to search around flowers, bees detecting visual cues hovered in front of them. These strategies may allow prey to identify the nature of visual cues and to locate the source of chemical cues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23698013/,2022-11-28 02:47:44 AM

          Objectives:
        
      
      The intent of this study was to investigate the relationships between vertebral degenerative changes resulting in spinal canal stenosis, spinal cord lesions and the development of spinal cord decompression sickness (DCS) in scuba divers.
    


          Setting:

          Methods:
        
      
      We examined 33 injured divers less than 50 years old by cervical and thoracic MRI and compared them with 34 matched control divers. The number of intervertebral disk abnormalities and the degree of canal compression were analyzed on T2-weighted sagittal images using a validated grading system developed recently. The presence and the distribution of hyperintense cord lesions in relation with the accident and the recovery status at 6 months were also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Canal spinal narrowing was more common in injured divers than in controls (79% vs. 50%, OR=3.7 [95% CI, 1.3-10.8], P=0.021). We found a significant linear association between the extent of canal stenosis, multisegmental findings and the development of spinal cord decompression sickness. MRI intramedullary lesions were significantly more frequent in divers with incomplete recovery (OR=16 [95% CI, 2.6-99], P=0.0014), but statistical analysis failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between canal compression, signal cord abnormalities and a negative clinical outcome.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that divers with cervical and thoracic spinal canal stenosis, mainly due to disk degeneration, are at increased risk for the occurrence of spinal cord decompression sickness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126850/,2022-11-28 02:47:46 AM
Injuries in underwater rugby: a retrospective cross-sectional epidemiological study,"Heinz-Lothar Meyer, Felicitas Minnemann, Christina Polan, Manuel Burggraf, Marcel Dudda, Max D Kauther, Heinz-Lothar Meyer, Felicitas Minnemann, Christina Polan, Manuel Burggraf, Marcel Dudda, Max D Kauther",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Underwater rugby (UWR) is a team sport which combines swimming sprints, apnoea diving, a good overview of the three-dimensional underwater space and wrestling for the ball.This was the first epidemiological study of UWR injuries in a large international collective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A questionnaire containing 124 questions was distributed to 198 active UWR players and completed under the supervision of medical staff. Demographic data and information about injuries in ten different body regions were collected.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 198 respondents, 106 (53.5%) were male and 92 (46.5%) were female. On average, each UWR player suffered a median of 19.5 (IQR 44) injuries. Based on the exposure time, means of 37.7 (SD 90.0) injuries per 1000 playing hours per player and 9.9 (20.1) injuries per year were found. Significant injuries mainly occurred to the head region (45.7%). Bruises and sprains were observed more often than fractures and dislocations. Male athletes had a longer total injury break time (median 4.8 [IQR 10.5] days), than female athletes (4 [8.6] days). Female athletes had more injuries (median 20 [IQR 26.8]) than male athletes (18.5 [63]). The length of the injury-related break time increased with the rise in body mass index.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The risk of severe injury in UWR is low compared to other ball sports like water polo and rugby. UWR is played under water and the impact of tackles is lessened by the water. Further studies should record chronic injuries in UWR and establish measures to prevent injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547779/,2022-11-28 02:47:47 AM
Hyperoxia and lack of ascorbic acid deplete tetrahydrobiopterin without affecting NO generation in endothelial cells,"Ronja Hesthammer, Torunn Eide, Einar Thorsen, Asboørn M Svardal, Rune Djurhuus, Ronja Hesthammer, Torunn Eide, Einar Thorsen, Asboørn M Svardal, Rune Djurhuus",2019,"Nitric oxide (NO) may protect against gas bubble formation and risk of decompression sickness. We have previously shown that the crucial co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is oxidized in a dose-dependent manner when exposed to hyperoxia similar to diving conditions but with minor effects on the NO production by nitric oxide synthase. By manipulating the intracellular redox state, we further investigated the relationship between BH4 levels and production of NO in human endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were cultured with and without ascorbic acid (AA) and the glutathione (GSH) synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine, prior to hyperoxic exposure. The levels of biopterins and GSH were determined in cell lysates while the production of NO was determined in intact cells. Omitting AA resulted in a 91% decrease in BH4 levels (0.49 ± 0.08 to 0.04 ± 0.01 pmol/10⁶ cells, p⟨0.001) at 20 kPa oxygen (O2), and 88% decrease (0.24 ± 0.03 to 0.03 ± 0.01 pmol/10⁶ cells, p=0.01) after exposure to 60 kPa O2. The NO generation was decreased by 23% (74.5 ± 2.2 to 57.3 ± 5.6 pmol/min/mg protein, p⟨0.001) at 20 kPa O2, but no significant change was observed at 60 kPa O2. GSH depletion had no effects on the NO generation. No correlation was found between NO generation and the corresponding intracellular BH4 concentration (p=0.675, r=-0.055) or the BH4 to BH2 ratio (p=0.983, r=0.003), determined across 18 in vitro experiments. Decreased BH4 in HUVECs, due to hyperoxia or lack of ascorbic acid, does not imply corresponding decreases in NO generation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509907/,2022-11-28 02:47:48 AM
Effect of multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation on the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy,"Pieter Martens, Guy Jacobs, Matthias Dupont, Wilfried Mullens, Pieter Martens, Guy Jacobs, Matthias Dupont, Wilfried Mullens",2018 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Both cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and Multidisciplinary Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) beneficially influence symptomatic status, exercise capacity, quality of life, and heart failure readmission rates. However, the interaction between both therapies remain incompletely addressed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive CRT patients implanted in a single tertiary care center were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were dived according to the participation in a structured CR-program following CRT-implant. The effect on functional status (New York Heart Association; NYHA-class), reverse remodeling (change in left ventricular ejection fraction; LVEF), and the combined endpoint of heart failure readmission and all-cause mortality was assessed after multivariate correction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 655 patients were analyzed of whom 223(34%) did and 432(66%) did not participate in a structured multidisciplinary CR-program following implant. No adverse events relating to exercise training occurred during the CR-program. Patients who participated in the CR-program had a more pronounced improvement in NYHA-class at 6-months (P = 0.006), even after multivariate correction (β = -0.144; 95% CI = [-0.270; -0.018]; P = 0.025). Maximal workload and VO2max on CPET at 6 months improved significantly even after adjustment (P < 0.001, respectively P = 0.017). At 6-months, CR associated with more improvement in LVEF (+11.9 ± 13 vs +14.5 ± 11; P = 0.008), however, this relationship was lost after multivariate correction (P = 0.136). During 36 ± 22 months follow-up, patients in the CR group had a higher event-free survival for the combined endpoint (P = 0.001), even after multivariate correction (adjusted HR = 0.547; CI = 0.366-0.818; P = 0.003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Following CRT-implant, the participation in a structured CR-program is safe and beneficially influences symptomatic response and clinical outcome. The beneficial effects of exercise training are potentially independent and additive to the beneficial reverse remodeling effect induced by CRT itself.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239134/,2022-11-28 02:47:48 AM
Risk factors for fatal drowning in a Greek region: a retrospective case-control study,"Dimitrios Phaedon Kevrekidis, Evdokia Brousa, Orthodoxia Mastrogianni, Amvrosios Orfanidis, Helen G Gika, Nikolaos Raikos, Dimitrios Phaedon Kevrekidis, Evdokia Brousa, Orthodoxia Mastrogianni, Amvrosios Orfanidis, Helen G Gika, Nikolaos Raikos",2021 Aug,"Background:
        
      
      Fatal drowning is one of the leading causes of unintentional injury mortality worldwide and a persistent public health concern in Greece. While several pathologic and sociodemographic contributing factors have been previously identified, these have not been extensively investigated in conjunction with the effects of psychoactive substances.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective case-control study of drowning deaths was conducted in the Greek regions of Northern Greece and Thessaly during a 10-year period. A regression model was constructed examining differences in detected substances, autopsy findings and sociodemographic characteristics between 240 victims of unintentional fatal submersion and 480 victims of other causes of sudden or violent death.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The majority of victims were males (69.4%) and foreign nationality was associated with increased odds of drowning. Cardiomegaly and coronary bypass grafts were significantly more likely to have been recorded among drowning victims, while the frequency of other circulatory system disorders was also elevated. Several of these findings were potential arrhythmogenic substrates which could adversely interact with the diving reflex. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the most commonly detected pharmacological group (9.0%), and along with tramadol, there was an increased likelihood of exposure to them. These drugs have been previously associated with QT prolongation and other adverse effects which may contribute to fatal outcomes in a seawater environment. In contrast, there was a decreased risk of exposure to dependence-inducing drugs and paracetamol.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Male sex, older age, foreign nationality and cardiovascular disease predisposed individuals to an elevated risk of fatal submersion. SSRI antidepressants and tramadol may contribute to this outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769124/,2022-11-28 02:47:49 AM
Intrapulmonary shunt and SCUBA diving: another risk factor?,"Dennis Madden, Marko Ljubkovic, Zeljko Dujic, Dennis Madden, Marko Ljubkovic, Zeljko Dujic",2015 Feb,"Laboratory and field investigations have demonstrated that intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA) may provide an additional means for venous gas emboli (VGE) to cross over to the arterial circulation due to their larger diameter compared to pulmonary microcirculation. Once thought to be the primary cause of decompression sickness (DCS), it has been demonstrated that, even in large quantities, their presence does not always result in injury. Normally, VGE are trapped in the site of gas exchange in the lungs and eliminated via diffusion. When VGE crossover takes place in arterial circulation, they have the potential to cause more harm as they are redistributed to the brain, spinal column, and other sensitive tissues. The patent foramen ovale (PFO) was once thought to be the only risk factor for an increase in arterialization; however, IPAVAs represent another pathway for this crossover to occur. The opening of IPAVAs is associated with exercise and hypoxic gas mixtures, both of which divers may encounter. The goal of this review is to describe how IPAVAs may impact diving physiology, specifically during decompression, and what this means for the individual diver as well as the future of commercial and recreational diving. Future research must continue on the relationship between IPAVAs and the environmental and physiological circumstances that lead to their opening and closing, as well as how they may contribute to diving injuries such as DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25693625/,2022-11-28 02:47:50 AM
Occupational Safety and Health in a Community of Shellfish Divers: A Community-Based Participatory Approach,"Marie A Garrido, Manuel Parra, Juana Díaz, Julia Medel, Dennis Nowak, Katja Radon, Marie A Garrido, Manuel Parra, Juana Díaz, Julia Medel, Dennis Nowak, Katja Radon",2020 Jun,"In artisanal fishing communities in Chile, the access to occupational safety and health (OSH) is limited by factors such as the informality of employment. Our objective was to analyze the working and health conditions of workers in a coastal town in Southern Chile, under a community-based participatory approach. We carried out two independent social dialogue workshops within the community. The first one (N of participants = 25) was aimed to identify the strengths, weaknesses and challenges for preventing decompression sickness among divers. The second workshop (N of participants = 10) was set to identify the work processes and to map the occupational risks during seafood harvesting and processing in the community. Community members' training for handling and preventing decompression sickness among divers, and the collaboration between a local health representative, stakeholders and authorities, were identified as contributing factors in reducing fatalities and sequels among divers in the past. Technology and safety on board the vessels, training of healthcare personnel in OSH, and access to health programs, were identified as remaining challenges. Through risk mapping, the participants identified the relationship between working and health conditions in the community, reinforcing the necessity of improving access to health and social security. The community participation in identifying and analyzing working and health conditions could be the first step for a strategy to address OSH through primary health care in rural communities. Community empowerment and involvement in action plans, training on basic OSH for health care workers, and public policies are required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31728798/,2022-11-28 02:47:51 AM
Dead or Alive? Factors Affecting the Survival of Victims during Attacks by Saltwater Crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Australia,"Yusuke Fukuda, Charlie Manolis, Keith Saalfeld, Alain Zuur, Yusuke Fukuda, Charlie Manolis, Keith Saalfeld, Alain Zuur",2015 May 11,"Conflicts between humans and crocodilians are a widespread conservation challenge and the number of crocodile attacks is increasing worldwide. We identified the factors that most effectively decide whether a victim is injured or killed in a crocodile attack by fitting generalized linear models to a 42-year dataset of 87 attacks (27 fatal and 60 non-fatal) by saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Australia. The models showed that the most influential factors were the difference in body mass between crocodile and victim, and the position of victim in relation to the water at the time of an attack. In-water position (for diving, swimming, and wading) had a higher risk than on-water (boating) or on-land (fishing, and hunting near the water's edge) positions. In the in-water position a 75 kg person would have a relatively high probability of survival (0.81) if attacked by a 300 cm crocodile, but the probability becomes much lower (0.17) with a 400 cm crocodile. If attacked by a crocodile larger than 450 cm, the survival probability would be extremely low (<0.05) regardless of the victim's size. These results indicate that the main cause of death during a crocodile attack is drowning and larger crocodiles can drag a victim more easily into deeper water. A higher risk associated with a larger crocodile in relation to victim's size is highlighted by children's vulnerability to fatal attacks. Since the first recently recorded fatal attack involving a child in 2006, six out of nine fatal attacks (66.7%) involved children, and the average body size of crocodiles responsible for these fatal attacks was considerably smaller (384 cm, 223 kg) than that of crocodiles that killed adults (450 cm, 324 kg) during the same period (2006-2014). These results suggest that culling programs targeting larger crocodiles may not be an effective management option to improve safety for children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961294/,2022-11-28 02:47:51 AM
"Early Sport Specialization Among Former National Collegiate Athletic Association Athletes: Trends, Scholarship Attainment, Injury, and Attrition","Caitlin M Rugg, Monica J Coughlan, Justine N Li, Sharon L Hame, Brian T Feeley, Caitlin M Rugg, Monica J Coughlan, Justine N Li, Sharon L Hame, Brian T Feeley",2021 Mar,"Background:
        
      
      Many youth athletes focus on 1 sport to gain a competitive advantage, but early sport specialization may increase risk of overuse injuries and burnout. College athletes have successfully achieved advanced status; therefore, the study of their specialization patterns is a method to assess how specialization affects an athletic career.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To determine trends in sport specialization by sex, sport, and decade of participation in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes and assess the effect of specialization on scholarship attainment, injury, and attrition.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An electronic survey was distributed to NCAA athletes who participated from 1960 to 2018. Survey topics included sex, sport, decade of participation, scholarship status, ≥30-day time-loss injuries sustained in college, orthopaedic surgery in college, career length, and age of single-sport specialization. Early specialization was defined as specialization in a single sport before age 15 years. Rates of early specialization were calculated for each sport, sex, individual and team sports, and decade of participation. Rates of scholarship attainment, injury, and attrition were compared between groups. Univariate associations were queried with logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of specialization, scholarship attainment, injury, and early attrition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1550 athletes who participated (17% response rate), 544 (35.1%) were women. Overall, 18.1% of athletes specialized before age 15 years (n = 281). Athletes in gymnastics, tennis, swimming and diving, and soccer were significantly more likely to specialize early, whereas football and baseball athletes were more likely to specialize late (P < .05 for all groups). Early specialization was more common among women (23.4% vs 15.2%; odds ratio, 1.72; P < .01). There was a trend toward earlier specialization for recent college graduates, with graduates from the last decade more likely to be classified as early specialization than those from previous decades (P = .036). Scholarship attainment was overall equivalent between groups. Time-loss injuries, lower extremity injuries, and orthopaedic surgery in college were not statistically different between groups. Career lengths were similar, but burnout was more common among early specialization athletes (10.5% vs 7.0%; odds ratio, 3.76; P < .01).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Less than one-fifth of NCAA athletes surveyed specialized before age 15 years, and neither scholarship attainment nor time-loss injury rate was affected by early specialization. Early specialization is on the rise but is associated with increased burnout.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33719607/,2022-11-28 02:47:52 AM
Hyperbaric oxygen-associated seizure leading to stroke,"Jordan M Warchol, Jeffrey S Cooper, Thomas S Diesing, Jordan M Warchol, Jeffrey S Cooper, Thomas S Diesing",2017 Dec,"Oxygen toxicity seizures are a well-known complication of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). Until now, there have not been any reported cases of an acute ischaemic event (stroke) as the result of a HBOT-associated oxygen toxicity seizure. We report an event in which a seizure and stroke occurred together and consider that the stroke may have been caused by seizure-induced demand ischaemia. This challenges the generally held view that oxygen toxicity seizures in the clinical hyperbaric setting are benign. A discussion of the literature on the subject of seizure-induced brain injury is included. Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease should be taken into consideration in determining treatment pressures for HBOT, as reducing pressure reduces seizure risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29241238/,2022-11-28 02:47:53 AM
Association of the Functional Movement Screen with injuries in division I athletes,"Meghan Warren, Craig A Smith, Nicole J Chimera, Meghan Warren, Craig A Smith, Nicole J Chimera",2015 May,"Context:
        
      
      The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) evaluates performance in 7 fundamental movement patterns using a 4-point scale. Previous studies have reported increased injury risk with a composite score (CS) of 14/21 or less; these studies were limited to specific sports and injury definition.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To examine the association between FMS CS and movement pattern scores and acute noncontact and overuse musculoskeletal injuries in division I college athletes. An exploratory objective was to assess the association between injury and FMS movement pattern asymmetry.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective cohort.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      College athletic facilities.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      167 injury-free, college basketball, football, volleyball, cross country, track and field, swimming/ diving, soccer, golf, and tennis athletes (males = 89).
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      The FMS was administered during pre-participation examination.
    


          Main outcome measure:
        
      
      Noncontact or overuse injuries that required intervention from the athletic trainer during the sport season.
    


          Results:
        
      
      FMS CS was not different between those injured (n = 74; 14.3 ± 2.5) and those not (14.1 ± 2.4; P = .57). No point on the ROC curve maximized sensitivity and specificity; therefore previously published cut-point was used for analysis with injury (≤ 14 [n = 92]). After adjustment, no statistically significant association between FMS CS and injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, 95% CI 0.53-1.91) existed. Lunge was the only movement pattern that was associated with injury; those scoring 2 were less likely to have an injury vs those who scored 3 (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.59). There was also no association between FMS movement pattern asymmetry and injury.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      FMS CS, movement patterns, and asymmetry were poor predictors of noncontact and overuse injury in this cohort of division I athletes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25203695/,2022-11-28 02:47:53 AM
Cecal bascule after spinal cord injury: A case series report,"Yuichi Ishida, Susan F McLean, Alan H Tyroch, Yuichi Ishida, Susan F McLean, Alan H Tyroch",2016,"Introduction:
        
      
      Cecal bascule is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction associated with upward and anterior folding of the ascending colon. We report three patients who presented with spinal cord injury complicated with a cecal bascule. Diagnosis and management of cecal bascule is discussed.
    


          Presentation of cases:
        
      
      Patient 1: 59-year-old male sustained a traumatic brain injury and cervical spinal cord injury after a motorcycle crash. He had abdominal distension and the diagnosis of cecal bascule was made. Cecopexy was performed. Patient 2: 51-year-old male sustained an unstable C7 vertebral fracture with a cord contusion and quadriplegia after a diving incident. After an unsuccessful medical management of the colonic distension, the patient was taken for a laparotomy and cecal bascule was found. A cecostomy and a cecopexy were performed. Patient 3: 63-year-old male was transferred after a fall. He had diffuse degenerative changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine. He was found to have a perforated cecal bascule. He had a right hemicolectomy with an ileocolic anastomosis.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      We suggest the possibility of spinal cord injury being a risk factor for cecal bascule. Currently, right hemicolectomy is recommended for the treatment of cecal bascule. Cecopexy is also acceptable treatment option for a case in which the patient will be undergoing an operation with an insertion of hardware.
    


          Conclusion:

DSM-5 paraphilic disorders criteria in the light of autoerotic asphyxiophilia and non-sexual form of oxygen restriction,"Marta Dora, Magdalena Mijas, Bartłomiej Dobroczyński, Marta Dora, Magdalena Mijas, Bartłomiej Dobroczyński",2019 Oct 30,"The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published in 2013 has proved to be particularly interesting in the field of sexuality. It introduced a number of significant changes in the definition of sexual norms, among them a widely discussed distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders. The key criterion separating the abnormal sexual interests from the disordered ones is clinically significant distress resulting directly from sexual behavior and/or the risk of suffering or harm to another person as a result of one's sexual behavior. In the case of masochism - which addresses the phenomenon of suffering quite particularly - this distinction is troublesome. Using the example of autoerotic asphyxia - a behavior from the masochism spectrum - the authors critically examine the proposed DSM-5 method of defining the standards of sexual behavior. Interesting in this regard has been a comparison between autoerotic asphyxia and free diving - a nonsexual activity which, although also associated with possible loss of life by reduction of oxygen, has not been pathologized.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31955188/,2022-11-28 02:47:55 AM
Hydrodisplacement of sural nerve for safety and efficacy of endovenous thermal ablation for small saphenous vein incompetence,"Omar Rodriguez-Acevedo, Kristen E Elstner, Kui Martinic, Aaron Zea, Jenny Diaz, Rodrigo T Martins, Fernando Arduini, Alexandra Hodgkinson, Nabeel Ibrahim, Omar Rodriguez-Acevedo, Kristen E Elstner, Kui Martinic, Aaron Zea, Jenny Diaz, Rodrigo T Martins, Fernando Arduini, Alexandra Hodgkinson, Nabeel Ibrahim",2017 Aug,"Background Endovenous radio frequency ablation for small saphenous vein incompetence by and large appears to be superior and safer than conventional open surgery. Small saphenous vein ablation from approximately mid-calf to the point proximally where the small saphenous vein dives into the popliteal fossa is considered to be safe, as the sural nerve is in most cases separated from this segment of the small saphenous vein by the deep fascia. The outcome of the distal incompetent small saphenous vein remains unclear. Efficacy of the endovenous radio frequency ablation can be enhanced by increasing the length of the ablatable small saphenous vein segment. Methodology To optimise endovenous radio frequency ablation outcome, the distal small saphenous vein may be made amenable to ablation if safety of the sural nerve can be assured. The sural nerve was successfully located using duplex ultrasound in 100% of our cohort in this study. The standard entry point for venous access was just above the lateral malleolus. After introduction of the introducer sheath, the radio frequency catheter was advanced proximally; the sural nerve was displaced from the small saphenous vein by approximately 1 cm with the administration of tumescent anaesthesia ( hydrodisplacement). A total of 118 patients underwent extended endovenous radio frequency ablation of 124 incompetent small saphenous vein trunks using the method described. Results Successful extended ablation of the small saphenous vein was achieved in 100% of cases and it was confirmed by duplex scanning at one and six weeks. Two neurological events were recorded during the study: 1. One patient with temporary foot drop lasting for less than 6 h with complete recovery. 2. A second patient with a sural nerve sensory deficit reported by the patient at day 2-3, which remains current at six weeks. Conclusions Extended endovenous radio frequency ablation of the small saphenous vein to optimise length of the ablatable vein segment is feasible with careful identification and hydrodisplacement of the sural nerve. This method is shown to be associated with fewer neurological complications than other methods reported in the literature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27688037/,2022-11-28 02:47:56 AM
Cardiovascular risk assessment in divers: Toward safer diving,"Rienk Rienks, Mattijn Buwalda, Jeroen Bucx, Emile Dubois, Thijs Wingelaar, Rob van Hulst, Rienk Rienks, Mattijn Buwalda, Jeroen Bucx, Emile Dubois, Thijs Wingelaar, Rob van Hulst",2022 Third Quarter,"Similar to aviation, diving is performed in an environment in which acute incapacitation may lead to a fatal outcome. In aeromedicine, a pilot is considered ""unfit to fly"" when the cardiovascular event risk exceeds one percent per annum, the so-called 1% rule. In diving no formal limits to cardiovascular risk have been established. Cardiovascular risk of divers can be calculated using the modified Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Risk of Harm formula: risk of harm (RH: cardiovascular fatality rate per year during diving: number × 10-⁵/divers/year) = time diving (TD: number of dives × 10-⁴) × sudden cardiac incapacitation (SCI: cardiovascular diver event rate per year (number × 10-⁵/year). The SCI and thus the RH are strongly dependent on age. Using the CCS criterion for RH, 5 × 10-⁵ divers/year, and considering an average of 25 dives per year per diver, the calculated maximum acceptable SCI is 2%/year, consistent with current practice for dive medical examinations. If the SCI were to exceed 2%/year, a diver could be considered ""unfit to dive,"" which could particularly benefit older (≥ 50 years) divers, in whom cardiovascular risk factors are often not properly treated. For the prevention of fatal diving accidents due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a dive medical examination is of limited value for young (≺ 50 years) divers who have no cardiovascular risk factors. Introducing a cardiovascular risk management system for divers may achieve a reduction in fatal diving accidents that result from cardiovascular disease in older divers engaged in both recreational and professional diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36001568/,2022-11-28 02:47:56 AM
Deep Learning-Based Venous Gas Emboli Grade Classification in Doppler Ultrasound Audio Recordings,"Arian Azarang, David Q Le, Andrew Hoang, Lesley S Blogg, Paul A Dayton, Rachel M Lance, Michael Natoli, Alan Gatrell, Frauke Tillmans, Richard E Moon, Peter Lindholm, Virginie Papadopoulou, Arian Azarang, David Q Le, Andrew Hoang, Lesley S Blogg, Paul A Dayton, Rachel M Lance, Michael Natoli, Alan Gatrell, Frauke Tillmans, Richard E Moon, Peter Lindholm, Virginie Papadopoulou",2022 Oct 27,"Objective:
        
      
      Doppler ultrasound (DU) is used to detect venous gas emboli (VGE) post dive as a marker of decompression stress for diving physiology research as well as new decompression procedure validation to minimize decompression sickness risk. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning model for VGE grading in DU audio recordings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A database of real-world data was assembled and labeled for the purpose of developing the algorithm, totaling 274 recordings comprising both subclavian and precordial measurements. Synthetic data was also generated by acquiring baseline DU signals from human volunteers and superimposing laboratory-acquired DU signals of bubbles flowing in a tissue mimicking material. A novel squeeze-and-excitation deep learning model was designed to effectively classify recordings on the 5-class Spencer scoring system used by trained human raters.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On the real-data test set, we show that synthetic data pretraining achieves average ordinal accuracy of 84.9% for precordial and 90.4% for subclavian DU which is a 24.6% and 26.2% increase over training with real-data and time-series augmentation only. The weighted kappa coefficients of agreement between the model and human ground truth were 0.74 and 0.69 for precordial and subclavian respectively, indicating substantial agreement similar to human inter-rater agreement for this type of data.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The present work demonstrates the first application of deep-learning for DU VGE grading using a combination of synthetic and real-world data.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      The proposed method can contribute to accelerating DU analysis for decompression research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36301781/,2022-11-28 02:47:57 AM

The relative risk increase, however, is difficult to establish as the PFO status of divers is usually only determined after a DCS occurrence. Methods: This prospective, single-blinded, observational study was designed to collect DCS data from volunteer divers after screening for right-to-left shunt (RLS) using a Carotid Doppler test. Divers were blinded to the result of the test, but all received a standardized briefing on current scientific knowledge of diving physiology and ""low-bubble"" diving techniques; they were then allowed to dive without restrictions. After a mean interval of 8 years, a questionnaire was sent collecting data on their dives and cases of DCS (if any occurred). Results: Data was collected on 148 divers totaling 66,859 dives. There was no significant difference in diving data between divers with or without RLS. Divers with RLS had a 3.02 times higher incidence of (confirmed) DCS than divers without RLS (p = 0.04). When all cases of (confirmed or possible DCS) were considered, the Relative Risk was 1.42 (p = 0.46). DCS occurred mainly in divers who did not dive according to ""low-bubble"" diving techniques, in both groups. Conclusion: This prospective study confirms that DCS is more frequent in divers with RLS (such as a PFO), with a Relative Risk of 1.42 (all DCS) to 3.02 (confirmed DCS). It appears this risk is linked to diving behavior, more specifically diving to the limits of the adopted decompression procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34777020/,2022-11-28 02:47:58 AM
Medical Management and Risk Reduction of the Cardiovascular Effects of Underwater Diving,"Thomas F Whayne, Thomas F Whayne",2018,"Undersea diving is a sport and commercial industry. Knowledge of potential problems began with Caisson disease or ""the bends"", first identified with compressed air in the construction of tunnels under rivers in the 19th century. Subsequently, there was the commercially used old-fashioned diving helmet attached to a suit, with compressed air pumped down from the surface. Breathhold diving, with no supplementary source of air or other breathing mixture, is also a sport as well as a commercial fishing tool in some parts of the world. There has been an evolution to self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving with major involvement as a recreational sport but also of major commercial importance. Knowledge of the physiology and cardiovascular plus other medical problems associated with the various forms of diving have evolved extensively. The major medical catastrophes of SCUBA diving are air embolism and decompression sickness (DCS). Understanding of the essential referral to a hyperbaric recompression chamber for these problems is critical, as well as immediate measures until that recompression is achieved. These include the administration of 100% oxygen and rehydration with intravenous normal saline. Undersea diving continues to expand, especially as a sport, and a basic understanding of the associated preventive and emergency medicine will decrease complications and save lives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28676021/,2022-11-28 02:47:58 AM

Propranolol Effects on Decompression Sickness in a Simulated DISSUB Rescue in Swine,"Angela S Forbes, David P Regis, Aaron A Hall, Richard T Mahon, William A Cronin, Angela S Forbes, David P Regis, Aaron A Hall, Richard T Mahon, William A Cronin",2017 Apr 1,"Introduction:
        
      
      Disabled submarine (DISSUB) survivors may face elevated CO2 levels and inert gas saturation, putting them at risk for CO2 toxicity and decompression sickness (DCS). Propranolol was shown to reduce CO2 production in an experimental DISSUB model in humans but its effects on DCS in a DISSUB rescue scenario are unknown. A 100% oxygen prebreathe (OPB) reduces DCS incidence and severity and is incorporated into some DISSUB rescue protocols. We used a swine model of DISSUB rescue to study the effect of propranolol on DCS incidence and mortality with and without an OPB.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In Experiment 1, male Yorkshire Swine (70 kg) were pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 22 h. Propranolol 1.0 mg · kg-1 (IV) was administered at 21.25 h. At 22 h, the animal was rapidly decompressed and observed for DCS type, onset time, and mortality. Experimental animals (N = 21; 69 ± 4.1 kg), PROP1.0, were compared to PROP1.0-OPB45 (N = 8; 69 ± 2.8 kg) with the same dive profile, except for a 45 min OPB prior to decompression. In Experiment 2, the same methodology was used with the following changes: swine pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 28 h; experimental group (N = 25; 67 ± 3.3 kg), PROP0.5 bis, propranolol 0.5 mg · kg-1 bis (twice) (IV) was administered at 22 h and 26 h. Control animals (N = 25; 67 ± 3.9 kg) received normal saline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      OPB reduced mortality in PROP1.0-OBP45 compared to PROP1.0 (0% vs. 71%). PROP0.5 bis had increased mortality compared to CONTROL (60-% vs. 4%).

Implications of a patent foramen ovale for environmental physiology and pathophysiology: do we know the 'hole' story?,"Andrew T Lovering, Tyler S Kelly, Kaitlyn G DiMarco, Karleigh E Bradbury, Nisha Charkoudian, Andrew T Lovering, Tyler S Kelly, Kaitlyn G DiMarco, Karleigh E Bradbury, Nisha Charkoudian",2022 Apr,"The foramen ovale is an essential component of the fetal circulation contributing to oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination that remains patent under certain circumstances in ∼30% of the healthy adult population, without major negative sequelae in most. Adults with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) have a greater tendency to develop symptoms of acute mountain sickness and high-altitude pulmonary oedema upon ascent to high altitude, and PFO presence is associated with worse cardiopulmonary function in chronic mountain sickness. This increase in altitude illness prevalence may be related to dysregulated cerebral blood flow associated with altered respiratory chemoreflex sensitivity; however, the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, men with a PFO appear to have a shift in thermoregulatory control to higher internal temperatures, both at rest and during exercise, and they have blunted thermal hyperpnoea. The teleological 'reason' for this thermoregulatory shift is unclear, but the shift of ∼0.5°C in core body temperature does not appear to be sufficient to have any significant negative consequences in terms of risk of heat illness. Further work in this area is needed, particularly in women, to evaluate mechanisms of heat storage and dissipation in these individuals compared to people without a PFO. Consequences of a PFO in SCUBA divers include a greater incidence of unprovoked decompression sickness, but whether PFO is beneficial or detrimental to breath hold diving remains unexplored. Whether PFO presence will explain interindividual variability in responses to, and consequences from, other environmental stressors such as spaceflight remain entirely unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35043424/,2022-11-28 02:49:57 AM

Intraoral pain elicited by changes in pressure is referred to as barodontalgia. Dental barotraumas are defined as pressure-induced damages of teeth and restorations. The pathophysiologic background so far is not completely clear. The present study deals with dental and orofacial symptoms which can occur as a result of pressure variations. With the aid of cantonal administrations, diving associations, and tunnel construction firms, 520 pressure-exposed individuals (499 scuba/ professional divers, 21 caisson workers operating at excess pressure) were questioned regarding dental problems. A personal interview was conducted with affected individuals. Problems in the dental area were experienced by 15% of all respondents. Toothaches were suffered by 10.2% of the participants. Tooth injuries occurred in 6.3% of all interviewees (26 fractured amalgam restorations, 4 crown fractures, 3 losses of tooth fragments). A proportion of 11.3% among the respondents complained about temporomandibular joint problems or mucosal irritations (for example aphthae) related to the mouthpieces. Barotraumas outside the dental area were incurred by 31.9% of the divers. Of these, 69.9% concerned the ears and 65.6% occurred during the descent. Based on the results obtained from the survey and taking into account the current literature, recommendations for the prevention of barotraumas in divers and caisson workers were prepared.

      The treatment of divers for decompression illness (DCI) in Auckland, New Zealand, has not been described since 1996, and subsequent trends in patient numbers and demographics are unmeasured.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective audit of DCI cases requiring recompression in Auckland between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2012. Data describing patient demographics, dive characteristics, presentation of DCI and outcomes were extracted from case notes and facility databases. Trends in annual case numbers were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficients (ρ) and compared with trends in entry-level diver certifications. Trends in patient demographics and delay between diving and recompression were evaluated using regression analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 520 DCI cases. Annual caseload decreased over the study period (ρ = 0.813, P < 0.0001) as did entry level diving certifications in New Zealand (ρ = 0.962, P < 0.0001). Mean diver age was 33.6 (95% confidence limits (CI) 32.7 to 34.5) years and age increased (P < 0.0001) over the study period. Median (range) delay to recompression was 2.06 (95% CI 0.02 to 23.6) days, and delay declined over the study period (P = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Numbers of DCI cases recompressed in Auckland have declined significantly over the last 17 years. The most plausible explanation is declining diving activity but improvements in diving safety cannot be excluded.

The leading cause of death is hypoxia, typically from equipment or procedural failures. Hypoxia causes very few symptoms prior to causing loss of consciousness. Additionally, since the electronics responsible for controlling oxygen levels in rebreathers often control their alarm systems, frequently divers do not receive any external warnings. This study investigated the use of a forehead pulse oximeter as an independent warning device in the event of rebreather failure. Ten test subjects (seven male, three female, median age 29, range 26-35) exercised at a targeted rate of 2 L/minute oxygen consumption while on a non-functional rebreather breathing loop (mean consumption achieved 2.09 ± 0.36 L/minute). Each subject was tested both at the surface and at pressurized depth of 77 fsw (starting pO₂=0.7 atm). The data show that a pulse oximeter could be used to provide an Mk 16 rebreather diver with a minimum mean of 49 seconds (± 17 seconds SD) of warning time after a noticeable change in blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂ ≤ 95%) but before any risk of loss of consciousness (calculated SpO₂ ≤ 80%), so that the diver may take mitigating actions. No statistical difference in warning time was found between the tests at surface and at 77 fsw (P=0.46).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29281194/,2022-11-28 02:50:20 AM
Successful treatment of highly recurrent facial baroparesis in a frequent high-altitude traveler: a case report,"Jason P Caffrey, Jason W Adams, Isabel Costantino, Kristin Klepper, Elina Kari, Lori A Brown, Jason P Caffrey, Jason W Adams, Isabel Costantino, Kristin Klepper, Elina Kari, Lori A Brown",2020 Nov 12,"Background:
        
      
      Facial baroparesis is a palsy of the seventh cranial nerve resulting from increased pressure compressing the nerve along its course through the middle ear cavity. It is a rare condition, most commonly reported in barotraumatic environments, in particular scuba diving and high-altitude air travel. We report here an unusual case of highly frequent baroparesis, workup, and successful treatment.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      A 57-year-old Caucasian male frequent commercial airline traveler presented with a 4-year history of recurrent episodes of right-sided facial paralysis and otalgia, increasing in both frequency and severity. Incidents occurred almost exclusively during rapid altitude changes in aircraft, mostly ascent, but also during rapid altitude change in an automobile. Self-treatment included nasal and oral decongestants, nasal corticosteroids, and warm packs. Temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scan revealed possible right-sided dehiscence of the tympanic bone segment; audiogram and magnetic resonance imaging of the internal auditory canals were unremarkable. After a diagnosis of facial nerve baroparesis was made, the patient underwent myringotomy with insertion of a pressure equalization tube (PET) into the right tympanic membrane. Despite re-exposure to altitude change multiple times weekly post-treatment, the patient reported being symptom-free for more than 6 months following intervention.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Prompt PET insertion may represent the preferred treatment for individuals who suffer recurrent episodes of facial baroparesis. Education regarding this rare condition may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of affected patients. Future studies should explore the pathophysiology and risk factors, compare therapeutic options, and provide follow-up data to optimize the management of affected patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33176863/,2022-11-28 02:50:21 AM

      Hyperbaric chambers and underwater environments are challenging and at risk of serious accidents. Personnel aiming to assist patients and subjects should be appropriately trained, and several courses have been established all over the world. In healthcare, simulation is an effective learning technique. However, there have been few peer-reviewed articles published in the medical literature describing its use in diving and hyperbaric medicine.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We implemented the curriculum of the Master's degree in hyperbaric and diving medicine held at the University of Padova with emergency medicine seminars created by the faculty and validated by external experts. These seminars integrated traditional lectures and eight in situ simulation scenarios.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the hyperbaric medicine seminar, simulations were carried out inside a real hyperbaric chamber at the ATIP Hyperbaric Treatment Centre, only using air and reproducing compression noise without pressurization to avoid damages to the manikins. The four scenarios consisted of hyperoxic seizures, pneumothorax, hypoglycemia, and sudden cardiac arrest. Furthermore, we added a hands-on session to instruct participants to prepare an intubated patient undergoing hyperbaric oxygen treatment with a checklist and simulating the patient transfer inside and outside the hyperbaric chamber. The diving medicine seminar was held at the Y-40 The Deep Joy pool in Montegrotto Terme (Italy), also involving SCUBA/breath-hold diving (BHD) instructors to rescue subjects from the water. These diving medicine scenarios consisted of neurologic syndrome (""taravana/samba"") in BHD, drowning of a breath-hold diver, pulmonary barotrauma in BHD, and decompression illness in a SCUBA diver.

Gut fermentation seems to promote decompression sickness in humans,"Sébastien de Maistre, Nicolas Vallee, Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, Claude Duchamp, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Sébastien de Maistre, Nicolas Vallee, Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, Claude Duchamp, Jean-Eric Blatteau",2016 Oct 1,"Massive bubble formation after diving can lead to decompression sickness (DCS) that can result in neurological disorders. In experimental dives using hydrogen as the diluent gas, decreasing the body's H2 burden by inoculating hydrogen-metabolizing microbes into the gut reduces the risk of DCS. In contrast, we have shown that gut bacterial fermentation in rats on a standard diet promotes DCS through endogenous hydrogen production. Therefore, we set out to test these experimental results in humans. Thirty-nine divers admitted into our hyperbaric center with neurological DCS (Affected Divers) were compared with 39 healthy divers (Unaffected Divers). Their last meal time and composition were recorded. Gut fermentation rate was estimated by measuring breath hydrogen 1-4 h after the dive. Breath hydrogen concentrations were significantly higher in Affected Divers (15 ppm [6-23] vs. 7 ppm [3-12]; P = 0.0078). With the use of a threshold value of 16.5 ppm, specificity was 87% [95% confidence interval (CI) 73-95] for association with neurological DCS onset. We observed a strong association between hydrogen values above this threshold and an accident occurrence (odds ratio = 5.3, 95% CI 1.8-15.7, P = 0.0025). However, high fermentation potential foodstuffs consumption was not different between Affected and Unaffected Divers. Gut fermentation rate at dive time seemed to be higher in Affected Divers. Hydrogen generated by fermentation diffuses throughout the body and could increase DCS risk. Prevention could be helped by excluding divers who are showing a high fermentation rate, by eliminating gas produced in gut, or even by modifying intestinal microbiota to reduce fermentation rate during a dive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27633737/,2022-11-28 02:52:34 AM

The purpose of this article is to show the professional adaptations to help him to continue occupational dive and to raise the question of the impact on diving risks of hormonal treatment in this case. He was a 39-year-old man when he began his transition. He had worked as a diver for 9 years before his transition. When he changed to look like a woman, there were a few difficulties in continuing his professional activity. The main difficulty was that he looked like a woman while working with men. Modesty was a crucial issue in the enterprise. There were other problems such as the organisation of premises, the physical workload and the interaction between treatments and diving. There is a lack of a law to guide the employer. French legislation does not address the issue of transsexuals for this profession. The medical recommendations do not specify contraindications or adaptations for diving safely. Because of his transition, he lost muscle mass. The occupational physician helped to adjust his activity: decreasing the weight of his diving suit, creating a female-like locker room etc. Finally, the question of the risk of decompression illness arose. Legal hormonal medication seems not to significantly increase the risk of decompression illness, but this diver was taking illicit treatment to speed up the transition.

Log-binomial regression models estimated associations with infant outcomes (e.g., major structural birth defects, low birthweight). Among 1,148,252 identified singleton infants, 3,843 were considered the offspring of male divers; paternal occupational diving was not positively associated with any adverse infant outcome under study.

A case-control study was conducted at Saad Abualila maternity hospital (Khartoum, Sudan) during the period of March through December 2015. Women who delivered live singleton babies were dived in two groups; the cases were women who had PTB ""delivery before completed 37weeks but after 24 weeks of pregnancy"" and the controls were women who delivered at term (37-42 weeks). Medical and obstetrics history was gathered using questionnaire. Serum folic acid was measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and twelve (56 in arm of the study) women were enrolled to the study. There was no significant difference between the cases and the controls in their age, parity, hemoglobin, body mass index, education and occupation. The median (interquartile) level of folic acid was significantly lower in the cases (PTB) than the level in the controls, 4.8(2.8-8.2) vs. 9.5(8.6-12.0) ng/ml. In binary regression, folic acid level was associated with lower risk of PTB (OR=0.64; 95%=0.53-0.77, P < 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between gestational age and folic acid level (r = 0.447, P<0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Thus serum folic acid level was significantly lower in women with PTB. Folic acid level was associated with lower risk of PTB.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29214043/,2022-11-28 02:52:36 AM
Computer-assisted paranasal sinus operation induces diving bradycardia,"Jochen D Schipke, Sinclair Cleveland, Christian Caspers, Jochen D Schipke, Sinclair Cleveland, Christian Caspers",2013 Jul-Aug,"Unintentional mechanical manipulation anywhere in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve might activate a reflexive bradycardia. Neurosurgeons need to bear in mind detrimental consequences on cardiac function. A female patient (53 years) underwent a computer-assisted (CAS), paranasal sinus operation performed under general anesthesia. During left sided CAS and preparation of the sinus ethmoidalis, heart rate significantly fell from 68 to 32 /min, while systolic arterial blood pressure decreased from 105 to 75 mmHg. Continuation of the preparation again decreased heart rate progressing to transient asystole lasting for 15 s. After removal of the instruments, asystole terminated without medical support. As heart rate decreased after renewed insertion of the CAS probe, sinus ethmoidalis surgery was completed after atropine administration. During neurosurgical procedures, the incidence of the reflex varies between 10 and 18%. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time on a direct stimulation of the ethmoidal nerve with instruments (CAS probe) during paranasal surgery. Although normally cardioprotective, exaggeration of the diving reflex can be detrimental and has been implicated in cardiorespiratory disorders, including sudden death and the sudden infant death syndrome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332411/,2022-11-28 02:52:37 AM
Hypolipidemia in a Special Operations Candidate: Case Report and Review of the Literature,"Jonathan E Strain 2nd, John A Vigilante, Nicholas W DiGeorge, Jonathan E Strain 2nd, John A Vigilante, Nicholas W DiGeorge",2015 Winter,"Background:
        
      
      A 19-year-old male military recruit who presented for a screening physical for US Naval Special Warfare Duty was found to have hypolipidemia. Medical history revealed mildly increased frequency of bowel movements, but was otherwise unremarkable. His presentation was most consistent with heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL), and the patient was cleared for Special Operations duty.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE. Keywords included familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, abetalipoproteinemia, hypolipidemia, diving, special operations, and military. Results that included cases of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Review of the literature reveals that FHBL is a genetic disorder frequently, but not always, due to a mutation in the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene. Those with the condition should be screened for ophthalmologic, neurologic, and gastrointestinal complications. Analysis of the disease, as well as the absence of reported cases of FHBL in diving and Special Operations, suggest there is minimal increased risk in diving and Special Operations for patients who are likely heterozygous, are asymptomatic, and have a negative workup for potential complications from the disease.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Individuals with presumed or proven heterozygous FHBL seeking clearance for Special Operations duty should be given precautions, undergo careful questioning for history of disease-specific complications, and should have a baseline evaluation. If negative, it seems reasonable to clear the patient for Special Operations and diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26630090/,2022-11-28 02:52:37 AM
Impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation in trained breath-hold divers,"M Erin Moir, Stephen A Klassen, Baraa K Al-Khazraji, Emilie Woehrle, Sydney O Smith, Brad J Matushewski, Duško Kozić, Željko Dujić, Otto F Barak, J Kevin Shoemaker, M Erin Moir, Stephen A Klassen, Baraa K Al-Khazraji, Emilie Woehrle, Sydney O Smith, Brad J Matushewski, Duško Kozić, Željko Dujić, Otto F Barak, J Kevin Shoemaker",2019 Jun 1,"Breath-hold divers (BHD) experience repeated bouts of severe hypoxia and hypercapnia with large increases in blood pressure. However, the impact of long-term breath-hold diving on cerebrovascular control remains poorly understood. The ability of cerebral blood vessels to respond rapidly to changes in blood pressure represents the property of dynamic autoregulation. The current investigation tested the hypothesis that breath-hold diving impairs dynamic autoregulation to a transient hypotensive stimulus. Seventeen BHD (3 women, 11 ± 9 yr of diving) and 15 healthy controls (2 women) completed two or three repeated sit-to-stand trials during spontaneous breathing and poikilocapnic conditions. Heart rate (HR), finger arterial blood pressure (BP), and cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) from the right middle cerebral artery were measured continuously with three-lead electrocardiography, finger photoplethysmography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, respectively. End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure was measured with a gas analyzer. Offline, an index of cerebrovascular resistance (CVRi) was calculated as the quotient of mean BP and BFV. The rate of the drop in CVRi relative to the change in BP provided the rate of regulation [RoR; (∆CVRi/∆T)/∆BP]. The BHD demonstrated slower RoR than controls (P ≤ 0.001, d = 1.4). Underlying the reduced RoR in BHD was a longer time to reach nadir CVRi compared with controls (P = 0.004, d = 1.1). In concert with the longer CVRi response, the time to reach peak BFV following standing was longer in BHD than controls (P = 0.01, d = 0.9). The data suggest impaired dynamic autoregulatory mechanisms to hypotension in BHD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Impairments in dynamic cerebral autoregulation to hypotension are associated with breath-hold diving. Although weakened autoregulation was observed acutely in this group during apneic stress, we are the first to report on chronic adaptations in cerebral autoregulation. Impaired vasomotor responses underlie the reduced rate of regulation, wherein breath-hold divers demonstrate a prolonged dilatory response to transient hypotension. The slower cerebral vasodilation produces a longer perturbation in cerebral blood flow velocity, increasing the risk of cerebral ischemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31070952/,2022-11-28 02:52:38 AM
Case Series of Arterial Gas Embolism Incidents in U.S. Navy Pressurized Submarine Escape Training From 2018 to 2019,"Mia Edgar, Michael A Franco, Hugh M Dainer, Mia Edgar, Michael A Franco, Hugh M Dainer",2021 May 3,"The goal of Pressurized Submarine Escape Training (PSET) is to prepare future submariners for the physical and mental challenges of escaping a disabled submarine and promote proper handling of the Beaufort Ltd Mk 11 Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment suit. Training participants are only permitted to enter PSET after strict health screening protocols have been met to optimize trainees' safety. Before PSET, trainees are given detailed, one-on-one instruction on proper ascent mechanics by specially trained Navy Dive instructors. Since the reinstatement of PSET by the U.S. Navy, four incidents of arterial gas embolism (AGE) have occurred in submarine trainees with a 10-year period (2009-2019). Of these four incidents, three were observed within a couple months of each other from 2018 to 2019. A comprehensive review of AGE history, epidemiology, dive physiology, pathophysiology, and management was completed. Prompted by the recent incidents relative to the low reported incidence rate of AGE in historical PSET training, reported potential risk factors were compared with better understand potential etiologies of AGE in already medically screened individuals.

Such modifications can affect endothelial function by exacerbating oxidative stress. This study investigated the effects of saturation diving on oxidative stress damage. Redox status was evaluated through: ROS production; total antioxidant capacity (TAC); nitric oxide metabolites (NOx); nitrotyrosine (3-NT); and lipid peroxidation (8-iso-PGF2α) assessment. Creatinine and neopterin were analyzed as markers of renal function and damage. Measurements were performed on saliva and urine samples obtained at four time points: pre; deep; post; and 24 h post. Four divers were included in the study. After the saturation dive (post), significant (p < 0.05) increases in ROS (0.12 ± 0.03 vs. 0.36 ± 0.06 µmol.min-1), TAC (1.88 ± 0.03 vs. 2.01 ± 0.08 mM), NOx (207.0 ± 103.3 vs. 441.8 ± 97.3 µM), 3-NT (43.32 ± 18.03 vs. 18.64 ± 7.45 nM·L-1), and 8-iso-PGF2α (249.7 ± 45.1 vs. 371.9 ± 54.9 pg·mg-1 creatinine) were detected.

Underwater blast injury: a review of standards,"Rachel M Lance, Cameron R Bass, Rachel M Lance, Cameron R Bass",2015 Sep,"The first cases of underwater blast injury appeared in the scientific literature in 1917, and thousands of service members and civilians were injured or killed by underwater blast during WWII. The prevalence of underwater blast injuries and occupational blasting needs led to the development of many safety standards to prevent injury or death. Most of these standards were not supported by experimental data or testing. In this review, we describe existing standards, discuss their origins, and we comprehensively compare their prescriptions across standards. Surprisingly, we found that most safety standards had little or no scientific basis, and prescriptions across standards often varied by at least an order of magnitude. Many published standards traced back to a US Navy 500 psi guideline, which was intended to provide a peak pressure at which injuries were likely to occur. This standard itself seems to have been based upon a completely unfounded assertion that has propagated throughout the literature in subsequent years. Based on the limitations of the standards discussed, we outline future directions for underwater blast injury research, such as the compilation of epidemiological data to examine actual injury risk by human beings subjected to underwater blasts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415071/,2022-11-28 02:52:41 AM

      To identify the predictors of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) and describe the differences between confirmed and potential TSCI cases in the prehospital setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective cohort study including all adult patients over a six-year period (2007-12) with potential TSCI who were attended and transported by Ambulance Victoria (AV). We extracted potential TSCI cases from the AV data warehouse and linked with the Victorian State Trauma Registry to compare with final hospital diagnosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included a total of 106,059 patients with potential TSCI in the study, with 257 having a spinal cord injury confirmed at hospital (0.2%). The median [First and third Quartiles] age of confirmed TSCI cases was 49 [32-69] years, with males comprising 84.1%. Confirmed TSCI were mainly due to falls (44.8%) and traffic incidents (40.5%). AV spinal care guidelines had a sensitivity of 100% to detect confirmed TSCI. There were several factors associated with a diagnosis of TSCI. These were meeting AV Potential Major Trauma criteria, male gender, presence of neurological deficit, presence of an altered state of consciousness, high falls (> 3 meters), diving, or motorcycle or bicycle collisions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study identified several predictors of TSCI including meeting AV Potential Major Trauma criteria, male gender, presence of neurological deficit, presence of an altered state of consciousness, high falls (> 3 meters), diving, or motorcycle or bicycle collisions. Most of these predictors are included in NEXUS and/or CCR criteria, however, Potential Major Trauma criteria have not previously been linked to the presence of TSCI. Therefore, Emergency Medical Systems are encouraged to integrate similar Potential Major Trauma criteria into their guidelines and protocols to further improve the provider's accuracy in identifying TSCI and to be more selective in their spinal immobilization, thereby reducing unwarranted adverse effects of this practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28414588/,2022-11-28 02:52:42 AM
Oxygen toxicity seizures during United States Navy Treatment Table 6: An acceptable risk in monoplace chambers?,"Samantha Bonnington, Neil Banham, Kevin Foley, Ian Gawthrope, Samantha Bonnington, Neil Banham, Kevin Foley, Ian Gawthrope",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may be complicated by oxygen toxicity seizures, which typically occur with hyperbaric partial pressures of oxygen exceeding 203 kPa (2 atmospheres absolute). All other hyperbaric units in Australia exclusively use a multiplace chamber when treating with United States Navy Treatment Table 6 (USN TT6) due to this perceived risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of a monoplace chamber when treating decompression illness (DCI) with USN TT6.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients treated at Fiona Stanley Hospital Hyperbaric Medicine Unit with USN TT6 between November 2014 and June 2020 was undertaken. These data were combined with previous results from studies performed at our hyperbaric unit at Fremantle Hospital from 1989 to 2014, creating a data set covering a 30-year period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One thousand treatments with USN TT6 were performed between 1989 and 2020; 331 in a monoplace chamber and 669 in a multiplace chamber. Four seizures occurred: a rate of 0.59% (1/167) in a multiplace chamber; and none in a monoplace chamber, indicating no statistically significant difference between seizures in a monoplace versus multiplace chamber (P = 0.31).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The rate of oxygen toxicity seizures in a monoplace chamber is not significantly higher than for treatment in the multiplace chamber. We conclude that using the monoplace chamber for USN TT6 in selected patients poses an acceptably low seizure risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157732/,2022-11-28 02:52:43 AM
Dangers of flying high and diving low! An unusual case of dyspnea,"Poornima Ramadas, Rumon Chakravarty, Prathik Krishnan, Anupa Nadkarni, Poornima Ramadas, Rumon Chakravarty, Prathik Krishnan, Anupa Nadkarni",2016 Nov 1,"Giant bullae are bullae that occupy at least 30 percent of a hemi thorax. This condition can rarely be idiopathic and not usually suspected in young patients with no risk factors. We describe a case of a giant solitary pulmonary bulla in a healthy young female with no known risk factors. 23-year-old female presented to the Emergency department with dyspnea and pleuritic right sided chest pain. She started experiencing these symptoms when she was on a 7-h flight and later experienced similar symptoms when she went scuba diving. Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds on the right and she was saturating well on room air. Chest X-ray done showed a large bleb at the right lung apex. CT angiogram done was negative for pulmonary embolism, but confirmed a large bulla involving the right upper lobe. She had no history of lung diseases, marfanoid features, cigarette smoking, drug use or family history of similar condition. She underwent VAT assisted mini thoracotomy with resection of the right apical bulla and tube thoracostomy. Surgical pathology showed a pulmonary bleb with pleural fibrosis and prominent adhesions with parietal pleura and no evidence of malignancy. She was advised to avoid air travel and diving for 3 months and is doing well. Idiopathic giant pulmonary bullae have rarely been reported.

Cervical Spine Injuries in the Athlete,"Gregory D Schroeder, Alexander R Vaccaro, Gregory D Schroeder, Alexander R Vaccaro",2017 Feb 15,"Cervical spine injuries are common and range from relatively minor injuries, such as cervical muscle strains, to severe, life-threatening cervical fractures with spinal cord injuries. Although cervical spine injuries are most common in athletes who participate in contact and collision sports, such as rugby and American football, they also have been reported in athletes who participate in noncontact sports, such as baseball, gymnastics, and diving. Cervical spine injuries in athletes are not necessarily the result of substantial spine trauma; some athletes have chronic conditions, such as congenital stenosis, that increase their risk for a serious cervical spine injury after even minor trauma. Therefore, physicians who cover athletic events must have a thorough knowledge of cervical spine injures and the most appropriate methods for managing them. Although cervical spine injuries can be career-ending injuries, athletes often are able to return to play after appropriate treatment if the potential for substantial reinjury is minimized.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28594515/,2022-11-28 02:52:44 AM
Incidence and Features of Barodontalgia Among Military Divers,"Mathieu Gunepin, Florence Derache, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik, Mathieu Gunepin, Florence Derache, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik",2016 Feb,"Objective:
        
      
      Divers are vulnerable to barodontalgia (atmospheric pressure change related dental pain), which may jeopardize diving safety and mission completion. Our aim was to investigate the experience of barodontalgia among western military divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      French Armed Forces diving personnel were asked to answer a structured questionnaire including questions regarding their oral health, diving and career features, and barodontalgia while diving. For analysis, the participants were divided into commando/clearance divers (Group A) and ship divers (Group B).
    


          Results:
        
      
      All the requested 1389 divers agreed to participate in the study (100%) and 1317 divers (94.8%) who fully completed the questionnaire were included in the analysis. Of these 1317 individuals, 96 (7.3%) suffered from at least 1 episode of barodontalgia while diving, with a total of 119 episodes of barodontalgia. Barodontalgia was more frequent in the upper (62.2%) than the lower dentition (37.8%) (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) and appeared more common during descent (77.3%) than ascent (22.7%) (OR = 11.6; 95% CI, 6.3-31.3). Barodontalgia experience was higher in divers who have an examination less than once per year (14.5%) in comparison to divers who usually have a dental examination once a year or more (6.3%) (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Barodontalgia mostly appeared in the maxilla and during descent; therefore, a great role for barosinusitis in the etiology of oral pain while diving may be suggested. The infrequent experience of barodontalgia in divers who routinely visit the dentist once a year or more suggests that the risk of barodontalgia might decrease with the maintenance of a good oral status.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26802379/,2022-11-28 02:52:45 AM
Psychological considerations in submarine escape training: brief overview and future directions,"Charles H Van Wijk, Charles H Van Wijk",2017,"The inability of a submarine to surface must rate as one of greatest risks to sailors in peacetime. To prepare for such emergencies, many navies provide training to master the procedures required to escape successfully from disabled submarines.

It further discusses applicable psychological constructs such as positive outcome expectancies, the role of anxiety, and other personal factors mediating outcomes of such training. It concludes with recommendations for future research aimed at enhancing the safety and impact of submarine escape training. These include enhanced detection of psychological risk factors such as anxiety, as well as investigating the relative contribution of personality variables to in-training safety and positive outcome expectancies. These recommendations do not only apply to submarine escape training, but may also be applicable to high fidelity safety training in other off-shore survival contexts, such as helicopter underwater escape training, freefall lifeboat training and smoke diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28952663/,2022-11-28 02:52:45 AM
Repeated hyperbaric exposure and glass ampoule safety,"Soon Yee Teoh, Venkat Narasimham Vangaveti, Soon Yee Teoh, Venkat Narasimham Vangaveti",2018 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      It has been our institution's policy to not place glass medication ampoules inside our hyperbaric chamber for fear of rupture. There is only a small and conflicting amount of data as to whether glass ampoules are safe for use under hyperbaric conditions.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The primary objective of this study was to test the safety and usability of glass medication ampoules inside a hyperbaric chamber.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Repetitive, rapidly staged compressions and decompressions were performed on multiple different glass medications ampoules inside the medical lock of a medical hyperbaric chamber. Medication ampoules of varying sizes (1 ml to 10 ml) of medication that may be required in a hyperbaric emergency were assessed. The ampoules were rapidly compressed 100 times to pressures of 142 kPa, 183 kPa, 300 kPa, 405 kPa and 507 kPa. They were then dropped from a height of 30 cm while compressed at 507 kPa and then half the ampoules were opened while pressurized at 507 kPa.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No ampoules were broken during compression or decompression. No ampoules broke when dropped from 30 cm onto the chamber floor. All ampoules opened at a pressure of 507 kPa functioned normally. No lids/ampoules shattered upon opening.

Pulmonary Barotrauma in a BUD/S Candidate Following Shallow Dives Using the MK 25 Rebreather,"Brian Andrew, Gilbert Boswell, Benjamin Sebreros, Paul Cusmano, Brian Andrew, Gilbert Boswell, Benjamin Sebreros, Paul Cusmano",2022 May 16,"Pulmonary barotrauma of ascent is a well-recognized risk of compressed air diving in the civilian and military diving communities. Chest imaging is a beneficial adjunct to clinical evaluation in screening select individuals for fitness to dive, evaluating dive-related injuries, and safely returning individuals to diving duty. We present a case of a 26-year-old male U.S. Navy Ensign and Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) candidate who experienced pulmonary barotrauma following two shallow dives to a maximum depth of 18 feet of seawater using the MK-25 100% oxygen rebreather. A chest radiograph showed a left upper lobe peripheral wedge-shaped opacity abutting the pleural surface. A subsequent computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed multifocal areas of peripheral pulmonary hemorrhage associated with small pneumatoceles. Two months after the diving injury, chest CT showed resolution of the pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumatoceles. Diving-related pulmonary barotrauma occurs most often secondary to breath-holding on ascent by inexperienced divers and is one of the most common diving injuries seen in BUD/S candidates. The risk of pulmonary barotrauma may be decreased through adequate training and thorough medical screening to include assessing for symptoms of infection before every dive. In cases of acute pulmonary barotrauma, chest radiographs may be used to screen for thoracic injury. Chest CT with inspiratory and expiratory sequences should be used to screen dive candidates on a case-by-case basis and to evaluate lung injury and predisposing pulmonary conditions following pulmonary barotrauma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35575801/,2022-11-28 02:52:47 AM

There were two surface snorkelers, 22 scuba air divers and seven nitrox divers, which included three closed-circuit rebreathers (CCR). The mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years, 58% of victims were females, and the average dive profile was to a maximum depth of 19 msw for 25 minutes. Six victims (19%) had previous episodes of IPE. There were nine recorded fatalities in this cohort. Medical comorbidities were recorded in 68%, with 42% being cardiac. The latter included valvular disease in 29%, transient cardiomyopathies in 26% and dysrhythmias in 16%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      IPE was more likely in middle-aged females, in experienced divers, and during ascent or after surfacing. Commonly reported associations such as exertion, stress, cold exposure, negative inspiratory pressure, hypertension, overhydration, tight wetsuit, aspiration and certain medications were identified. This series supports the hypothesis that the elderly IPE subjects are likely to have comorbidities and be susceptible to IPE recurrences and fatalities unless the contributing factors can be identified and addressed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683357/,2022-11-28 02:52:49 AM
Is more complex safer in the case of bail-out rebreathers for extended range cave diving?,"Derek B Covington, Charlotte Sadler, Anthony Bielawski, Gareth Lock, Andrew Pitkin, Derek B Covington, Charlotte Sadler, Anthony Bielawski, Gareth Lock, Andrew Pitkin",2022 Mar 31,"Nowhere is redundancy more indispensable than extended range cave diving. Training and practice in this discipline ensure divers are equipped with backup regulators, gauges, lights, and adequate breathing gas for a safe exit, emergencies, and decompression. Depending on penetration distances and depth, open circuit cave diving may require carrying more gas cylinders than can be logistically managed by the diver themselves while maintaining safe gas supply margins. Consequently, divers are forced to either stage cylinders in the cave prior to the dive or rely on resupply from support divers. Both scenarios have significant drawbacks. Due to the improved efficiency of breathing gas utilisation and other advantages, closed circuit rebreathers (CCR) have enabled extended range cave diving. With increasing depths, penetration distances, and bottom times, these divers must also plan for an increasing amount of open circuit bail-out gas in the event of CCR failure. Staged cylinders have traditionally been utilised, but this strategy has limitations due to the advanced dives needed to place them and equipment degradation due to prolonged water immersion, which can often result in cylinder and regulator corrosion with consequent leakage of contents over time. Consequently, a growing number of CCR divers are foregoing open-circuit bailout altogether by carrying an additional CCR system for bailout. Although these bailout rebreathers may facilitate further exploration and have certain advantages, the risks of diving with two complex machines remain to be clearly defined.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313373/,2022-11-28 02:52:49 AM
Early detection of diving-related cognitive impairment of different nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures using critical flicker fusion frequency,"Pierre Lafère, Walter Hemelryck, Peter Germonpré, Lyubisa Matity, François Guerrero, Costantino Balestra, Pierre Lafère, Walter Hemelryck, Peter Germonpré, Lyubisa Matity, François Guerrero, Costantino Balestra",2019 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Cognitive impairment related to inert gas narcosis (IGN) is a threat to diving safety and operations at depth that might be reduced by using enriched air nitrox (EANx) mixtures. Using critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), a possible early detection of cognitive abilities/cerebral arousal impairment when breathing different oxygen (O2) fractions was investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight male volunteers performed, in random order, two dry chamber dives breathing either air or EANx40 (40% O₂-60% nitrogen) for 20 minutes (min) at 0.4 MPa. Cognition and arousal were assessed before the dive; upon arrival at 0.4 MPa; after 15 min exposure at 0.4 MPa; on surfacing and 30 min post-dive using behavioural computer-based testing psychology experiment building language (PEBL) and by CFFF while continuously recording brain oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In both breathing conditions, CFFF and PEBL demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (Pearson r of -0.90, P < 0.0001), improved cognitive abilities/cerebral arousal occurred upon arrival at 0.4 MPa followed by a progressive deterioration. Initial brain activation was associated with a significant increase in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) and a simultaneous decrease of deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb). The magnitude of the changes was significantly greater under EANx (P = 0.038).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Since changes were not related to haemodynamic variables, HbO₂ and HHb values indicate a significant, O₂-dependent activation in the prefrontal cortex. Owing to the correlation with some tests from the PEBL, CFFF could be a convenient measure of cognitive performance/ability in extreme environments, likely under the direct influence of oxygen partial pressure, a potent modulator of IGN symptoms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177518/,2022-11-28 02:52:50 AM

      Surf zone injuries include cervical spine injuries (CSI). Risk factors for CSI have not been extensively investigated. The objective was to examine risk factors associated with diagnosed CSI that occurred in a beach setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective case series used manually linked data from Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service Emergency Departments, Queensland Ambulance Service, Surf Life Saving Queensland (SLSQ), and Bureau of Meteorology data from 01/01/2015-21/04/2021. Variables included victim demographics, mechanism of injury, scene information, and patient course.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-nine of the 574 (13.8%) confirmed CSI occurred at the beach. Local residents and visitors were injured equally. Females represented a minority (12.7%) of those diagnosed with CSI but were a higher proportion of suspected spinal incidents reported to SLSQ (45%). Surfers were more likely to be injured through shallow water diving than swimmers (27.6% vs 2.2%). Females were more likely to be injured by shallow water diving than males (30.0% vs 8.7%). Visitors were more likely to be injured swimming and local residents surfing (68.2% vs 77.8% respectively). CSI occurred most commonly (40.0%) with a below average ocean wave height (0.75-1.25 m) and were most likely (45.3%) to occur in the second half of the outgoing tide. One beach had a statistically significant greater incidence of spinal incidents (OR 3.9, 95% CI: 2.1-7.2) and of CSI (OR 10.7, 95% CI: 1.5-79.5).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Risk factors for CSI at the beach include male sex, smaller wave height and an outgoing tide. Shallow water diving among surfers and females should be addressed urgently.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35869457/,2022-11-28 02:52:51 AM
"Frequency of decompression illness among recent and extinct mammals and ""reptiles"": a review","Agnete Weinreich Carlsen, Agnete Weinreich Carlsen",2017 Aug,"The frequency of decompression illness was high among the extinct marine ""reptiles"" and very low among the marine mammals. Signs of decompression illness are still found among turtles but whales and seals are unaffected. In humans, the risk of decompression illness is five times increased in individuals with Patent Foramen Ovale; this condition allows blood shunting from the venous circuit to the systemic circuit. This right-left shunt is characteristic of the ""reptile"" heart, and it is suggested that this could contribute to the high frequency of decompression illness in the extinct reptiles.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656350/,2022-11-28 02:52:52 AM
Postmortem CT appearance of gas collections in fatal diving accidents,"Pierre-Eloi Laurent, Mathieu Coulange, Julien Mancini, Christophe Bartoli, Jacques Desfeux, Marie-Dominique Piercecchi-Marti, Guillaume Gorincour, Pierre-Eloi Laurent, Mathieu Coulange, Julien Mancini, Christophe Bartoli, Jacques Desfeux, Marie-Dominique Piercecchi-Marti, Guillaume Gorincour",2014 Sep,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to define the postmortem CT semiology of gas collections linked to putrefaction, postmortem ""off-gassing,"" and decompression illness after fatal diving accidents and to establish postmortem CT diagnostic criteria to distinguish the different causes of death in diving. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. A 4-year prospective study was conducted including cases of death during diving. A hyperbaric physician analyzed the circumstances of death and the dive profile, and an autopsy was performed. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the analysis from their dive profile: decompression illness, death after decompression dive without decompression illness, and death after nondecompression dive without decompression illness. Full-body postmortem CT was performed before autopsy. RESULTS. The presence of intraarterial gas associated with death by decompression illness had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, but the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 54% because of postmortem off-gassing. The PPV reached 70% when considering pneumatization of the supraaortic trunks. Pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and intraarterial gas, all of which are classic criteria for decompression illness diagnosis, are not specific for decompression illness. CONCLUSION. This study is the first to show that pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and intraarterial gas, all of which are classic criteria for decompression illness diagnosis, are not specific for decompression illness. Complete pneumatization of supraaortic trunks is the best postmortem CT criteria to detect a fatal decompression illness when CT is performed within 24 hours after death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25148148/,2022-11-28 02:52:52 AM

We therefore evaluated the association between decompression illness and executive functioning among artisanal divers in southern Chile. The cross-sectional study included 104 male divers and 58 male non-diving fishermen from two fishing communities. Divers self-reported frequency and severity of symptoms of decompression illness. Executive function was evaluated by perseverative responses and perseverative errors in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Age, alcohol consumption, and symptoms of depression were a-priori defined as potential confounders and included in linear regression models. Comparing divers and non-divers, no differences in the executive function were found. Among divers, 75% reported a history of at least mild decompression sickness. Higher frequency and severity of symptoms of decompression illness were associated with reduced executive function. Therefore, intervention strategies for artisanal divers should focus on prevention of decompression illness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34073026/,2022-11-28 02:52:53 AM
Considerations for scuba and breath-hold divers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A call for awareness,"Antonis Elia, Mikael Gennser, Antonis Elia, Mikael Gennser",2020 Dec 20,"In late 2019, a highly pathogenic novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 emerged from Wuhan, China and led to a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for the pulmonary system and can result in serious pneumonia necessitating hospitalisation. Computed tomography (CT) chest scans of patients with severe symptoms, show signs of multifocal bilateral ground or ground-glass opacities (GGO) associated with consolidation areas with patchy distribution. However, it is less well known that both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients may exhibit similar lung changes. Presumably, the various pathological changes in the lungs may increase the risk of adverse events during diving (e.g., lung barotrauma, pulmonary oedema, etc.), thus these lung manifestations need to be considered prior to allowing resumption of diving. Presently, it is not known how the structural changes in the lungs develop and to what extent they resolve, in particular in asymptomatic carriers and patients with mild disease. However, current evidence indicates that a month of recovery may be too short an interval to guarantee complete pulmonary restitution even after COVID-19 infections not demanding hospital care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325024/,2022-11-28 02:52:54 AM
"Correlation between Patent Foramen Ovale, Cerebral ""Lesions"" and Neuropsychometric Testing in Experienced Sports Divers: Does Diving Damage the Brain?","Costantino Balestra, Peter Germonpré, Costantino Balestra, Peter Germonpré",2016 May 11,"SCUBA diving exposes divers to decompression sickness (DCS). There has been considerable debate whether divers with a Patent Foramen Ovale of the heart have a higher risk of DCS because of the possible right-to-left shunt of venous decompression bubbles into the arterial circulation. Symptomatic neurological DCS has been shown to cause permanent damage to brain and spinal cord tissue; it has been suggested that divers with PFO may be at higher risk of developing subclinical brain lesions because of repeated asymptomatic embolization of decompression-induced nitrogen bubbles. These studies however suffer from several methodological flaws, including self-selection bias. We recruited 200 volunteer divers from a recreational diving population who had never suffered from DCS; we then randomly selected 50 of those for further investigation. The selected divers underwent brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging to detect asymptomatic brain lesions, contrast trans-oesophageal echocardiography for PFO, and extensive neuro-psychometric testing. Neuro-psychometry results were compared with a control group of normal subjects and a separate control group for subjects exposed to neurotoxic solvents. Forty two divers underwent all the tests and are included in this report. Grade 2 Patent Foramen Ovale was found in 16 (38%) of the divers; brain Unidentified Bright Objects (UBO's) were found in 5 (11.9%). There was no association between PFO and the presence of UBO's (P = 0.693) or their size (p = 0.5) in divers. Neuropsychometric testing in divers was significantly worse from controls in two tests, Digit Span Backwards (DSB; p < 0.05) and Symbol-Digit-Substitution (SDS; p < 0.01). Compared to subjects exposed to neurotoxic solvents, divers scored similar on DSB and SDS tests, but significantly better on the Simple Reaction Time (REA) and Hand-Eye Coordination (EYE) tests. There was no correlation between PFO, number of UBO's and any of the neuro-psychometric tests. We conclude that for uneventful recreational diving, PFO does not appear to influence the presence of UBO's. Diving by itself seems to cause some decrease of short-term memory and higher cognitive function, including visual-motor skills; this resembles some of the effects of nitrogen narcosis and we suggest that this may be a prolonged effect of diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27242609/,2022-11-28 02:52:55 AM
"The association of kidney function with repetitive breath-hold diving activities of female divers from Korea, Haenyeo","Yun Jung Oh, Ji Yong Jung, Sung Soo Kim, Kyong-Suk Chae, Jiwon Rhu, Chungsik Lee, Yun Jung Oh, Ji Yong Jung, Sung Soo Kim, Kyong-Suk Chae, Jiwon Rhu, Chungsik Lee",2017 Feb 23,"Background:
        
      
      Voluntary apnea during breath-hold diving (BHD) induces cardiovascular changes including bradycardia, reduced cardiac output, and arterial hypertension. Although the impacts of repetitive BHD on cardiovascular health have been studied previously, the long-term risk for kidney dysfunction has never been investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional propensity score-matched study was performed to evaluate the influence of repetitive long-lasting BHD on kidney function. Using matching propensity scores (PS), 715 breath-hold female divers (Haenyeo) and non-divers were selected for analysis from 1,938 female divers and 3,415 non-divers, respectively. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated to be less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was investigated in both diver and non-diver groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of CKD was significantly higher in breath-hold divers compared with non-divers after PS matching (12.6% vs. 8.0%, P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, BHD activity was significantly associated with the risk of CKD in an unmatched cohort (OR, 1.976; 95% CI, 1.465-2.664). In the PS-matched cohort, BHD remained the independent risk factor for CKD even after adjusting for multiple covariates (OR 1.967; 95% CI, 1.341-2.886).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Shallow but repetitive intermittent apnea by BHD, sustained for a long period of time, may potentially cause a deterioration in kidney function, as a long-term consequence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28228118/,2022-11-28 02:52:56 AM

Age-related differences in factors associated with cervical spine injuries in children,"Julie C Leonard, David M Jaffe, Cody S Olsen, Nathan Kuppermann, Julie C Leonard, David M Jaffe, Cody S Olsen, Nathan Kuppermann",2015 Apr,"Objectives:
        
      
      The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) investigators previously identified risk factors associated with cervical spine injuries (CSIs) in children. Anatomic maturation and age-related variation in mechanisms of injury suggested the need to explore factors separately for younger versus older children. The purpose of this substudy was to investigate CSI risk factors in age subgroups within the PECARN study cohort.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an age-stratified case-control analysis of children younger than 16 years presenting to 17 PECARN hospitals following blunt trauma between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2004. Data were abstracted for children with CSIs and randomly selected CSI-free children. Age-stratified multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with CSI within three age groups: younger than 2, 2 to 7, and 8 to 15 years. Sensitivity and specificity for CSI were estimated for both the age-specific and original (altered mental status, focal neurologic findings, neck pain, torticollis, substantial torso injury, predisposing conditions, diving, and high-risk motor vehicle crash [MVC]) models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 540 children with CSIs, 27 were younger than 2 years, 140 were 2 to 7 years, and 373 were 8 to 15 years. Focal neurologic deficits and high-risk MVC were associated with CSIs in all age-specific models. Other age-specific factors included the following: younger than 2 years, none; 2 to 7 years, altered mental status, neck pain, torticollis; and 8 to 15 years, altered mental status, neck pain, diving. Age-specific models had comparable sensitivity to the original model among the older groups, but had lower sensitivity and higher specificity among the youngest children.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While this analysis supports the original PECARN model for CSI, there were subtle age variations in factors associated with CSIs in children that warrant future investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25779934/,2022-11-28 02:52:58 AM
Knowledge and Behavioral Habits to Reduce Mycotoxin Dietary Exposure at Household Level in a Cohort of German University Students,"Katherine Muñoz, Mara Wagner, Florian Pauli, Juliane Christ, Gerhard Reese, Katherine Muñoz, Mara Wagner, Florian Pauli, Juliane Christ, Gerhard Reese",2021 Oct 26,"Mycotoxins pose a health concern for humans. Therefore, strategies at pre- and post-harvest and maximum levels for food have been implemented, aimed to minimize the risk of dietary exposure. Yet, consumers' dietary habits and life style play a substantial role in overall exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate knowledge of mycotoxins and accordance to behavioral practices or habits that may affect the risk of mycotoxin dietary exposure at the household level or when food commodities are obtained from non-regulated trade markets. For this purpose, an online survey was applied to a university student cohort (n = 186). The survey consisted of 23 questions grouped in five categories: Socio-demographic and income data, general life style and habits, knowledge about mycotoxins, compliance with the ""17 golden rules to prevent mycotoxin contamination"" of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), and measures towards reducing health risks. We paid particular attention to knowledge and compliance of a group acquiring food items in markets outside regulation and surveillance, namely, adherents of food movements such as food sharing or dumpster diving. The results of our study indicate a generally rather low level of knowledge about mycotoxins in the investigated cohort, as well as a weak perception of their associated risks compared to similar studies; around half of the cohort was unfamiliar with the term ""mycotoxin"" and the health risks of mycotoxins were considered comparable to those of pesticides, heavy metals, microplastics and food additives. We observed, in general, a relatively high degree of compliance with the proposed golden rules. The rules with the highest compliance related to deteriorated foods with visible signs of fungal infestation, probably because these are already considered as food waste. Rules that were less followed included those that require a specific knowledge of food storage and early fungal contamination stages, namely preventive measures related to storage of bread. Adherents of food movements did not differ significantly with the control group in terms of knowledge, risk perception and compliance with the 17 golden rules. This may be due to the homogeneity of the cohort in terms of demography, age and educational level. However, significant low compliance in the food movements group was observed with the rules ""Buy fruit and vegetables that are as intact as possible, i.e., without injuries and bruises"" and ""Rotten fruit should neither be eaten nor further processed into compote or jam"", possibly because of ideological convictions around reducing food waste. In conclusion, mycotoxin prevention strategies should not end at the retail level; in particular, clarification and information regarding health risk from mycotoxins are suggested in order to reduce the risk of exposure in private households or in informal trade markets. The results of this study should, however, be interpreted with caution due to the specific characteristics of the cohort in terms of age and educational level and the disparity in size between the control and the food movement group. This study is a starting point for evaluating and understanding the consumer perspective on mycotoxins.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34822544/,2022-11-28 02:52:59 AM
"Social responses of travelling finless porpoises to boat traffic risk in Misumi West Port, Ariake Sound, Japan","Naruki Morimura, Yusuke Mori, Naruki Morimura, Yusuke Mori",2019 Jan 2,"Anthropogenic effects have created various risks for wild animals. Boat traffic is one of the most fatal risks for marine mammals. Individual behavioral responses of cetaceans, including diving behavior such as changing swimming direction and lengthing inter-breath interval, to passing boats is relatively well known; however, the social function of cetacean responses to boat traffic in a natural setting remains poorly understood. We focused on describing the behavioral responses of single and aggregated finless porpoises to boats passing at Misumi West Port, Ariake Sound, Japan, by using a drone characterized with a high-precision bird's-eye angle. During the study period, we collected 25 episodes of finless porpoise responses to boats passing by. A mean (± SEM) of 5.1 ± 1.0 individuals were observed for each episode. The primary response to passing boats was avoidance by dive, which implies boat traffic is a substantial disturbance to finless porpoises that travel along the seawater surface daily. The diving duration decreased significantly with an increase in the number of aggregated individuals. The diving and floating reaction times were 10.9 ± 2.3 s and 18.7 ± 5.0 s, respectively. There was no significant difference between the reaction times indicating that each individual was motivated to keep the group cohesion consistent when floating even after the risk had dissolved, which is comparable to the behavior of porpoises that dive when riskier conditions are present, such as when a boat approaches an aggregation. Our findings provide new insights on the sociality of finless porpoises even though there were limitations, like an inability to identify a specific individual. The drone enabled us to observe the social behavior of finless porpoises and other cetaceans at an unprecedented resolution, which may lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary diversity of intelligence and sociality and the bridge to human evolution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30601827/,2022-11-28 02:52:59 AM

This investigation examined core temperature responses to fatiguing, fully-immersed exercise in extremely warm waters. Twenty-one male U.S. Navy divers (body mass, 87.3 ± 12.3 kg) were monitored during rest and fatiguing exercise while fully-immersed in four different water temperatures (Tw): 34.4, 35.8, 37.2, and 38.6°C (Tw34.4, Tw35.8, Tw37.2, and Tw38.6 respectively). Participants exercised on an underwater cycle ergometer until volitional fatigue or core temperature limits were reached. Core body temperature and heart rate were monitored continuously. Trial performance time decreased significantly as water temperature increased (Tw34.4, 174 ± 12 min; Tw35.8, 115 ± 13 min; Tw37.2, 50 ± 13 min; Tw38.6, 34 ± 14 min). Peak core body temperature during work was significantly lower in Tw34.4 water (38.31 ± 0.49°C) than in warmer temperatures (Tw35.8, 38.60 ± 0.55°C; Tw37.2, 38.82 ± 0.76°C; Tw38.6, 38.97 ± 0.65°C).

Dive-related fatalities among tourist and local divers in the northern Croatian littoral (1980-2010),"Valter Stemberga, Anja Petaros, Veronika Rasic, Josip Azman, Ivan Sosa, Miran Coklo, Ivone Uhac, Alan Bosnar, Valter Stemberga, Anja Petaros, Veronika Rasic, Josip Azman, Ivan Sosa, Miran Coklo, Ivone Uhac, Alan Bosnar",2013 Mar-Apr,"Background:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to retrospectively analyze diving fatalities occurring in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County (northern Croatian littoral), Croatia between 1980 and 2010 in order to identify differences between fatally injured tourist and resident divers, as well as temporal changes in the frequency of diver deaths.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medico-legal and police reports of 47 consecutive fatal diving cases were reviewed to determine the frequency of death among divers in relation to year and month of death, age, sex, nationality, organization of diving, diving type, and health condition.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The majority of victims were foreign citizens (59.6%) most of whom fell victim to scuba diving (70.4%). It was found that 79% of resident divers succumbed during free-diving. The number of diving fatalities increased significantly in the last three decades, especially among free-divers. Of the victims, 93% were males, usually belonging to younger age groups with tourist divers being significantly older than local divers. And 31.9% of divers, mostly tourists, showed signs of acute, chronic, or congenital pathological conditions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Fatally injured foreign divers differ from resident diver fatalities in diving method and age. Tourists are the group most at risk while scuba diving according to the Croatian sample. Occupational scuba divers and free-divers are the group most at risk among resident divers. This study is an important tool in uncovering the most common victims of diving and the related risk factors. It also highlights the problems present in the legal and medical monitoring of recreational divers and discusses possible pre-event, event, and post-event preventive actions that could lead to reduced mortality rates in divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23464717/,2022-11-28 02:53:01 AM

Dehydration is associated with reductions in mental and physical performance, resulting in less effective work and an increased risk of work-related accidents. In this study we examined the hydration status of 11 male divers over 19 days of a commercial saturation diving campaign to a working depth of 74 m, using two non-invasive methods: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and urine specific gravity (USG). Measurements were made daily before and after bell runs, and the BIA data was used to calculated total body water (TBW). We found that BIA and USG were weakly negatively correlated, probably reflecting differences in what they measure. TBW was significantly increased after bell runs for all divers, but more so for bellmen than for in-water divers. There were no progressing changes in TBW over the 19-day study period, indicating that the divers' routines were sufficient for maintaining their hydration levels on short and long term.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36246118/,2022-11-28 02:53:02 AM

Predictive models for clinical decision making: Deep dives in practical machine learning,"Sandra Eloranta, Magnus Boman, Sandra Eloranta, Magnus Boman",2022 Aug,"The deployment of machine learning for tasks relevant to complementing standard of care and advancing tools for precision health has gained much attention in the clinical community, thus meriting further investigations into its broader use. In an introduction to predictive modelling using machine learning, we conducted a review of the recent literature that explains standard taxonomies, terminology and central concepts to a broad clinical readership. Articles aimed at readers with little or no prior experience of commonly used methods or typical workflows were summarised and key references are highlighted. Continual interdisciplinary developments in data science, biostatistics and epidemiology also motivated us to further discuss emerging topics in predictive and data-driven (hypothesis-less) analytics with machine learning. Through two methodological deep dives using examples from precision psychiatry and outcome prediction after lymphoma, we highlight how the use of, for example, natural language processing can outperform established clinical risk scores and aid dynamic prediction and adaptive care strategies. Such realistic and detailed examples allow for critical analysis of the importance of new technological advances in artificial intelligence for clinical decision-making.

Transient ischemic attacks from arterial gas embolism induced by glossopharyngeal insufflation and a possible method to identify individuals at risk,"Tomas A Schiffer, Peter Lindholm, Tomas A Schiffer, Peter Lindholm",2013 Mar,"Breath-hold divers report transient, severe neurological symptoms that could be caused by arterial gas embolism after glossopharyngeal insufflation. This technique is often used to overinflate the lungs and stretch the chest prior to breath-holding and can increase the transpulmonary pressure to around 7-8 kPa, so introducing risk of pulmonary barotrauma. Airway pressure, blood pressure and static spirometry (nitrogen dilution) were measured simultaneously in ten subjects attempting to identify individuals at risk. Compared to baseline, total lung capacity (TLC) after glossopharyngeal insufflation increased by 19 % along with increased vital capacity (23 %) and residual volume (6 %) (P < 0.05), while mean relaxed airway pressure (P (aw)) at TLC increased from 3.62 ± 0.93 to 7.26 ± 2.04 kPa as a result of performing glossopharyngeal insufflation (P = 0.0001). Blood pressure fell during glossopharyngeal insufflation and attained relaxed airway pressure correlated positively to baseline mean arterial pressure in the subjects. Two of the subjects had glossopharyngeal insufflation-related accidents before the study and two subjects (with the highest P (aw) during GI; 9 and 10.3 kPa respectively) suffered glossopharyngeal insufflation-related accidents within 6 months after our study, with one suffering a non-fatal drowning accident. The principal finding of this study was that some subjects were able to use GI to reach P (aw) high enough to suggest a risk of pulmonary barotrauma, while other subjects would lose consciousness due to hypotension while still within safe limits of pulmonary pressure. This mechanism could offer an alternative explanation to drowning in breath-hold divers, and indicates that glossopharyngeal insufflation should be avoided or done with extreme caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22983570/,2022-11-28 02:53:04 AM

Comparison of treatment recompression tables for neurologic decompression illness in swine model,"W Rainey Johnson, Nicholas G Roney, Hanbing Zhou, Geoffrey E Ciarlone, Brian T Williams, William T Green, Richard T Mahon, Hugh M Dainer, Brett B Hart, Aaron A Hall, W Rainey Johnson, Nicholas G Roney, Hanbing Zhou, Geoffrey E Ciarlone, Brian T Williams, William T Green, Richard T Mahon, Hugh M Dainer, Brett B Hart, Aaron A Hall",2022 Oct 5,"Background:
        
      
      Significant reductions in ambient pressure subject an individual to risk of decompression illness (DCI); with incidence up to 35 per 10,000 dives. In severe cases, the central nervous system is often compromised (>80%), making DCI among the most morbid of diving related injuries. While hyperbaric specialists suggest initiating recompression therapy with either a Treatment Table 6 (TT6) or 6A (TT6A), the optimal initial recompression treatment for severe DCI is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Swine were exposed to an insult dive breathing air at 7.06 ATA (715.35 kPa) for 24 min followed by rapid decompression at a rate of 1.82 ATA/min (184.41 kPa/min). Swine that developed neurologic DCI within 1 hour of surfacing were block randomized to one of four United States Navy Treatment Tables (USN TT): TT6, TT6A-air (21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen), TT6A-nitrox (50% oxygen, 50% nitrogen), and TT6A-heliox (50% oxygen, 50% helium). The primary outcome was the mean number of spinal cord lesions, which was analyzed following cord harvest 24 hours after successful recompression treatment. Secondary outcomes included spinal cord lesion incidence and gross neurologic outcomes based on a pre- and post- modified Tarlov assessment. We compared outcomes among these four groups and between the two treatment profiles (i.e. TT6 and TT6A).
    


          Results:
        
      
      One-hundred and forty-one swine underwent the insult dive, with 61 swine meeting inclusion criteria (43%). We found no differences in baseline characteristics among the groups. We found no significant differences in functional neurologic outcomes (p = 0.77 and 0.33), spinal cord lesion incidence (p = 0.09 and 0.07), or spinal cord lesion area (p = 0.51 and 0.17) among the four treatment groups or between the two treatment profiles, respectively. While the trends were not statistically significant, animals treated with TT6 had the lowest rates of functional deficits and the fewest spinal cord lesions. Moreover, across all animals, functional neurologic deficit had strong correlation with lesion area pathology (Logistic Regression, p < 0.01, Somers' D = 0.74).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      TT6 performed as well as the other treatment tables and is the least resource intensive. TT6 is the most appropriate initial treatment for neurologic DCI in swine, among the tables that we compared.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36197931/,2022-11-28 02:53:06 AM
Sudden Unexpected Death and the Mammalian Dive Response: Catastrophic Failure of a Complex Tightly Coupled System,"Frank F Vincenzi, Frank F Vincenzi",2019 Feb 19,"In tightly coupled complex systems, when two or more factors or events interact in unanticipated ways, catastrophic failures of high-risk technical systems happen rarely, but quickly. Safety features are commonly built into complex systems to avoid disasters but are often part of the problem. The human body may be considered as a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure (sudden unexpected death, SUD) when certain factors or events interact. The mammalian dive response (MDR) is a built-in safety feature of the body that normally conserves oxygen during acute hypoxia. Activation of the MDR is the final pathway to sudden cardiac (SCD) in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and sudden cardiac death in water (SCDIW, fatal drowning). There is no single cause in any of these death scenarios, but an array of, unanticipated, often unknown, factors or events that activate or interact with the mammalian dive reflex. In any particular case, the relevant risk factors or events might include a combination of genetic, developmental, metabolic, disease, environmental, or operational influences. Determination of a single cause in any of these death scenarios is unlikely. The common thread among these seemingly different death scenarios is activation of the mammalian dive response. The human body is a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure when that ""safety feature"" is activated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30886584/,2022-11-28 02:53:07 AM
An audit of persistent foramen ovale closure in 105 divers,"Alex Pearman, Luc Bugeja, Martin Nelson, Gergely V Szantho, Mark Turner, Alex Pearman, Luc Bugeja, Martin Nelson, Gergely V Szantho, Mark Turner",2015 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Right-to-left shunt across a persistent foramen ovale (PFO) has been associated with cutaneous, neurological and vestibular decompression illness (DCI). Percutaneous closure of a PFO has been used to reduce the risk of DCI. There are no randomised controlled trial data to support PFO closure for the prevention of decompression illness (DCI), so the need for audit data on the safety and efﬁcacy of this technique has been recognised by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Retrospective audit of all transcatheter PFO closures to reduce the risk of DCI performed by a single cardiologist with an interest in diving medicine.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 105 eligible divers undergoing 107 procedures was identiﬁed. There was a low rate of procedural complications; a rate lower than a recent randomised trial of PFO closure for stroke. Atrial ﬁbrillation required treatment in two patients. One patient with a previously repaired mitral valve had a stroke that was thought to be unrelated to the PFO closure. Sixteen divers had minor post-procedure symptoms not requiring any treatment. Two divers required a second procedure because of residual shunt; both subsequently returned to unrestricted diving. Eighty-one of 95 divers in whom follow-up bubble contrast echocardiography was available returned to unrestricted diving.

The zebrafish Multivariate Concentric Square Field: A Standardized Test for Behavioral Profiling of Zebrafish ( Danio rerio),"Laura E Vossen, Ronja Brunberg, Pontus Rådén, Svante Winberg, Erika Roman, Laura E Vossen, Ronja Brunberg, Pontus Rådén, Svante Winberg, Erika Roman",2022 Mar 17,"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an important model organism in the study of the neurobiological basis of human mental disorders. Yet the utility of this species is limited by the quality of the phenotypical characterization tools available. Here, we present a complex testing environment for the quantification of explorative behavior in adult zebrafish, the zebrafish Multivariate Concentric Square Field™ (zMCSF), adapted from the rodent equivalent that has been used in > 40 studies. The apparatus consists of a central open area which is surrounded by a dark corner with a roof (DCR), corridors, and an inclined ramp. These areas differ in illumination, water depth, and are sheltered or exposed to different degrees. We quantified behavior of male and female wild-caught and AB strain zebrafish in the zMCSF (day 1) and cross-validated these results using the novel tank diving test (NTDT) (day 2). To assess the effect of repeated testing, AB zebrafish we tested a second time in both tests 1 week later (on days 7 and 8). We detected strong differences between the strains, with wild zebrafish swimming faster and spending more time in the corridors and on the ramp, while they avoided the open area in the center. AB zebrafish were less hesitant to enter the center but avoided the ramp, and often left one or more zones unexplored. No major sex differences in exploratory behavior were detected in either strain, except for a slightly higher velocity of AB males which has been reported before. Importantly, the zMCSF was largely resilient to repeated testing. The diving test revealed only one difference confined to one sex; wild females paid more visits to the top third than AB females. In isolation, this finding could lead to the conclusion that wild zebrafish are more risk-taking, which is incorrect given this strain's avoidance of open areas. To conclude, our results suggest that the zMCSF presents a sophisticated behavioral tool that can distinguish between different magnitudes and types of risk, allowing the user to create an intricate behavioral profile of individual adult zebrafish.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35368300/,2022-11-28 02:53:08 AM
"SCUBA Medicine for Otolaryngologists: Part II. Diagnostic, Treatment, and Dive Fitness Recommendations","Jonathan R Mallen, Daniel S Roberts, Jonathan R Mallen, Daniel S Roberts",2020 Jan,"Objectives:
        
      
      Challenge current practices and misconceptions in treating recreational SCUBA (Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) divers. Differentiate patients who are fit to dive and those with relative and absolute contraindications. Redefine the standard of care for fitness to dive parameters based on the most up-to-date evidence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a review of the available medical and diving literature in English, German, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, and French to determine the degree of evidence or lack thereof behind recommendations for treating SCUBA divers. The databases of PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane library, as well as available textbooks, were queried for relevant data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Current recommendations regarding fitness to dive are overly prohibitive given the available evidence. Insufficient evidence currently exists to justify the level of certainty with which some recommendations have been made previously. This is particularly true with regard to postsurgical patients, including those who have undergone stapedectomy or skull base repairs. Updated treatment guidelines, particularly those regarding the timely differentiation of barotrauma and decompression sickness, as well as clearance for return to diving following surgery or trauma, are presented herein.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Current guidelines for otorhinolaryngologists governing the diagnosis and treatment of SCUBA divers are lacking and in some instances founded on insufficient evidence.

Genes lost during the transition from land to water in cetaceans highlight genomic changes associated with aquatic adaptations,"Matthias Huelsmann, Nikolai Hecker, Mark S Springer, John Gatesy, Virag Sharma, Michael Hiller, Matthias Huelsmann, Nikolai Hecker, Mark S Springer, John Gatesy, Virag Sharma, Michael Hiller",2019 Sep 25,"The transition from land to water in whales and dolphins (cetaceans) was accompanied by remarkable adaptations. To reveal genomic changes that occurred during this transition, we screened for protein-coding genes that were inactivated in the ancestral cetacean lineage. We found 85 gene losses. Some of these were likely beneficial for cetaceans, for example, by reducing the risk of thrombus formation during diving (F12 and KLKB1), erroneous DNA damage repair (POLM), and oxidative stress-induced lung inflammation (MAP3K19). Additional gene losses may reflect other diving-related adaptations, such as enhanced vasoconstriction during the diving response (mediated by SLC6A18) and altered pulmonary surfactant composition (SEC14L3), while loss of SLC4A9 relates to a reduced need for saliva. Last, loss of melatonin synthesis and receptor genes (AANAT, ASMT, and MTNR1A/B) may have been a precondition for adopting unihemispheric sleep.

Immersion pulmonary edema and comorbidities: case series and updated review,"Dionne F Peacher, Stefanie D Martina, Claire E Otteni, Tracy E Wester, Jennifer F Potter, Richard Edward Moon, Dionne F Peacher, Stefanie D Martina, Claire E Otteni, Tracy E Wester, Jennifer F Potter, Richard Edward Moon",2015 Jun,"Purpose:
        
      
      Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) occurs in swimmers (especially triathletes) and scuba divers. Its pathophysiology and risk factors are incompletely understood. This study was designed to establish the prevalence of preexisting comorbidities in individuals who experience IPE.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From 2008 to May 2010, individuals who had experienced IPE were identified via recruitment for a physiological study. Past medical history and subject characteristics were compared with those available in the current body of literature.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, 36 subjects were identified (mean age = 50.11 ± 10.8 yr), of whom 72.2% had one or more significant medical conditions at the time of IPE incident (e.g., hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias or structural abnormality or dysfunction, asthma, diabetes mellitus, overweight or obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism). Forty-five articles were included, containing 292 cases of IPE, of which 24.0% had identifiable cardiopulmonary risk factors. Within the recreational population, cases with identifiable risk factors comprised 44.9%. Mean age was 47.8 ± 11.3 yr in recreational divers/swimmers and 23.3 ± 6.4 yr in military divers/swimmers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Cardiopulmonary disease may be a common predisposing factor in IPE in the recreational swimming/diving population, whereas pulmonary hypertension due to extreme exertion may be more important in military cases. Individuals with past history of IPE in our case series had a greater proportion of comorbidities compared to published cases. The role of underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction may be underestimated, especially in older swimmers and divers. We conclude that an episode of IPE should prompt the evaluation of cardiac and pulmonary function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25222821/,2022-11-28 02:53:11 AM
"Hyperbaric Treatment Of Compressed Air Workers, Caissons, Tunneling, Bounce Diving, and Saturation Diving","Owen J. ONeill, Anthony Haftel, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie, Owen J. ONeill, Anthony Haftel, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie",,"The field of compressed air work (CAW) includes caisson workers, tunnel workers, commercial divers, and inside observers working in multiplace hyperbaric chambers and any environment with increased atmospheric pressure. To summarize, this field includes all workers who perform duties at increased atmospheric pressure. This article will reference all of the workers in these varied environments as compressed air workers (CAWs). CAWs use compressed air during tunneling jobs to prevent flooding by groundwater and/or the entrance of toxic substances such as methane gas. The CAW field has undergone significant change since tunnels and caissons were first constructed in the 1800s. Between that time and the early 1980s, tunnels were primarily excavated by hand by workers exposed to the extremes of increased atmospheric pressure. There was a high incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) among caisson workers (CAWs), commonly referred to as the bends, due to the ""bent over"" bodily posture workers assumed secondary to the pain in the hips and spine caused by DCS. Pile driving has since replaced much of the need for compressed air caisson work. Skilled and well trained commercial divers perform underwater compressed air work. Their risk of decompression sickness and air gas embolism gets mitigated through the use of well designed academic diving education programs and the use of continuously updated decompression tables and modeling. On-site hyperbaric chambers and medical teams are necessary for specific job sites depending on the conditions and depth of the work. Regulations for compressed air work are on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website under standard number 1926.803-Compressed Air. Despite all attempts to mitigate risk, tunnel CAWs may still suffer the signs and symptoms of DCS and a variety of other typical construction work-related hazards. This paper will discuss CAWs performance in dry hyperbaric environments, particularly those pertaining to tunnel and caisson work, as well as the different methods of compression used to keep them safe and the job productive and cost-effective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194360/,2022-11-28 02:53:12 AM
Decreasing carbon monoxide in the diving air of artisanal fishermen in the Yucatán peninsula by separation of engine exhaust from compressor intake,"Walter Chin, Oswaldo Huchim-Lara, Silvia Salas, Walter Chin, Oswaldo Huchim-Lara, Silvia Salas",2016 Jul-Aug,"Artisanal fishermen in the Yucatán Peninsula utilize hookah dive systems (HDS). The air compressors in these HDS are not filtered, and the intake is near the engine exhaust. This proximity allows carbon monoxide (CO) from the exhaust to directly enter the HDS volume tank and contaminate the fishermen diver's air supply. Conservative safety standards permit a diver's air supply to contain 10 parts per million (ppm) of CO. This study quantified the levels of CO in the diver's air supply both before and after physical separation of the engine exhaust from the compressor intake. CO levels in seven volume tanks were analyzed before and after a 1-inch hose was attached to the compressor intake and elevated 5 feet above the engine exhaust. The tanks were drained and refilled before collecting each set of pre- and post-intervention gas samples. Four CO measurements were collected before and after the intervention from each volume tank. A C-Squared© CO Analyzer (± 1 ppm), calibrated with a Praxair 70 ppm CON2 gas (± 5%), was used to analyze the gas samples. A paired samples t-test shows a statistically significant difference in average CO values before and after the intervention (t = 6.8674, df: 27; p⟨0.0001). The physical separation of the engine exhaust from the compressor intake reduced the CO contamination of the diver air supply by 72%. This intervention could be applied to the hookah systems in the rest of the fishing cooperative to reduce the divers' risk of CO poisoning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28763170/,2022-11-28 02:53:12 AM
Fasting improves static apnea performance in elite divers without enhanced risk of syncope,"Erika Schagatay, Angelica Lodin-Sundström, Erika Schagatay, Angelica Lodin-Sundström",2014,"In competitive apnea divers, the nutritional demands may be essentially different from those of, for example, endurance athletes, where energy resources need to be maximised for successful performance. In competitive apnea, the goal is instead to limit metabolism, as the length of the sustainable apneic period will depend to a great extent on minimising oxygen consumption. Many but not all elite divers fast before performing static apnea in competition. This may increase oxygen consumption as mainly lipid stores are metabolised but could also have beneficial effects on apneic duration. Our aim was to determine the effect of over-night fasting on apnea performance. Six female and seven male divers performed a series of three apneas after eating and fasting, respectively. The series consisted of two 2-min apneas spaced by 3 min rest and, after 5 min rest, one maximal effort apnea. Apneas were performed at supine rest and preceded by normal respiration and maximal inspiration. Mean (± SD) time since eating was 13 h (± 2 h 43 min) for the fasting and 1 h 34 min (± 33 min) for the eating condition (P < 0.001). Mean blood glucose was 5.1 (± 0.4) mmol/L after fasting and 5.9 (± 0.7) mmol/L after eating (P<0.01). Lung volumes were similar in both conditions (NS). For the 2-min apneas, nadir SaO2 during fasting was 95 (± 1)% and 92 (± 2)% (P < 0.001) on eating and ETCO2 was lower in the fasting condition (P < 0.01) while heart rate (HR) during apnea was 74 (± 10) bpm for fasting and 80 (± 10) bpm for eating conditions (P < 0.01). Maximal apnea durations were 4 min 41 s (± 43 s) during fasting and 3 min 51 s (± 37 s) after eating (P < 0.001), and time without respiratory contractions was 31 s (25%) longer after fasting (P < 0.01). At maximal apnea termination, SaO2 and ETCO2 were similar in both conditions (NS) and apneic HR was 63 (± 9) bpm for fasting and 70 (± 10) bpm for eating (P < 0.01). The 22% longer apnea duration after fasting with analogous end apnea SaO2 levels suggests that fasting is beneficial for static apnea performance in elite divers, likely via metabolism-limiting mechanisms. The oxygen-conserving effect of the more pronounced diving response and possibly other metabolism-limiting mechanisms related to fasting apparently outweigh the enhanced oxygen consumption caused by lipid metabolism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24444200/,2022-11-28 02:53:13 AM
Decompression sickness predictive models for unsafe human exposure,"P K Weathersby, K A Gault, P K Weathersby, K A Gault",2013 May-Jun,"Decompression sickness (DCS) incidence prediction models have achieved useful predictive success under conditions of routine Navy diving. However, extrapolation into higher-risk exposures, e.g., emergency conditions, has been a problem. We have assembled a calibration data set of 3,300 single exposures with 200 DCS cases emphasizing high-incidence data from the U.S. Navy compilation of manned diving trials. We also evaluated a variant of the older linear-exponential risk model family where the instantaneous risk is defined as the relative supersaturation squared. Goodness of fit was assessed by maximum likelihood, by comparison of categories of observed and predicted cases in three ways (component data set, depth-time group, and risk level), and by reproduction of data dose-response trends. Four models fit the data well. Two had the old risk definition, and two had the new. With each risk definition, a satisfactory set of parameters was found differing mainly in treatment of gas kinetics in the fastest compartment. Multimodel inferences were made with a combination of the four models weighted using the Akaike Information Criterion. The combined model is recommended for use in emergency preparations where compressed-air exposures may lead to a 40% or higher incidence of DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23789560/,2022-11-28 02:53:14 AM
Patent Foramen Ovale in Recreational and Professional Divers: An Important and Largely Unrecognized Problem,"Jakub Honěk, Luděk Šefc, Tomáš Honěk, Martin Šrámek, Martin Horváth, Josef Veselka, Jakub Honěk, Luděk Šefc, Tomáš Honěk, Martin Šrámek, Martin Horváth, Josef Veselka",2015 Aug,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with an increased risk of decompression sickness (DCS) in divers that results from a paradoxical embolization of nitrogen bubbles.

It is interesting that despite these numbers, many important issues regarding optimal screening, risk stratification, and management strategy still remain to be resolved. Recently published data suggest the possible effectiveness of both PFO closure and conservative diving measures in preventing arterial gas embolization.

"Decompression sickness, fatness and active hydrophobic spots","Pieter Jan Am van Ooij, Pieter Jan Am van Ooij",2018 Sep 30,"Since decompression sickness (DCS) in humans was first described, mankind has embarked on an odyssey to prevent it. The demonstration that decompression releases bubbles, which mainly contain inert gas (nitrogen, helium), into the circulation and that the slower the decompression rate the lesser the incidence of DCS, resulted in 1908 in the publication of the first, reasonably safe diving tables. Besides the development of proper diving tables, the selection of divers is also of importance. A relationship between body composition and DCS was observed in dogs as long ago as the nineteenth century, an observation supported early in the twentieth century: ""Really fat men should never be allowed to work in compressed air, and plump men should be excluded from high pressure caissons…or in diving to more than about 10 fathoms, and at this depth the time of their exposure should be curtailed. If deep diving is to be undertaken…. skinny men should be selected."" Alas, nothing is that simple! From my own experience it was not always the fat diver who ended up in the treatment chamber with DCS. Therefore, other factors must be at play; gender, age, physical fitness, and the existence of a persistent foramen ovale (PFO) have all been studied as possible factors for the development of vascular gas bubbles and, therefore, for DCS. However, none of these factors, alone or in combination, explain why there are intra-individual or intra-cohort differences in bubble grades (BG). In other words, why does a dive I did today led to a high BG but the same dive next week lead to a low one? Or, why is there such a difference in BG amongst divers of more or less the same age, gender, body composition and physical fitness? In a letter in this issue, a novel hypothesis is postulated that may fill in these gaps; active hydrophobic spots (AHS). These AHS can be found at the luminal side of capillary, venous and arterial walls and have an oligolamellar lining. In an in vitro experiment, nanobubbles developed on AHS after a 'dive' to 1,000 kPa (90 msw). It appears that AHS consist of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which is the main component of surfactant. It is proposed that DPPC may leak from the alveoli into the alveolar capillary and be transported to veins and arteries where it precipitates and forms AHS. Based on these ideas, it is hypothesized that AHS generate nanobubbles that can grow into microbubbles. When these microbubbles detach from the AHS they might also take along pieces of the AHS membrane making the AHS smaller or even disappear. This phenomenon could explain some of the earlier findings regarding the formation of microbubbles in divers. The fact that the presence of microbubbles differs between younger and older divers, after repetitive dives, and between experienced divers and novice divers can be explained by this model, and AHS may be the missing link we are looking for in our quest to understand and treat DCS. However, some reservations must be made. Firstly, these observations are derived from in vitro and animal experiments and whether or not they reflect a similar process in man remains unclear. Secondly, it appears that female divers have lower bubble grades after similar dives compared to male divers, suggesting lower decompression stress. If AHS is the main generator for microbubbles, there should be a difference in the presence of AHS between men and women. We do not know from these animal experiments whether there is a gender difference, neither does a literature search in PubMed provide us with an answer. Thirdly, as said before, DPPC is the main component of surfactant. All alveolar surfactant phospholipids, such as DPPC, are secreted to the alveolar space via exocystosis of the lamellar bodies (LB) from alveolar type II (ATII) cells. To form a functional air-blood barrier, alveolar type I and ATII cells are connected to each other by tight junctions. These tight junctions constitute the seal of the intercellular cleft and in that way form a true barrier between the alveolus and the capillary. Only small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. can penetrate through this barrier by themselves due to passive diffusion. All other (macro)molecules, including DPPC, need intermediate processes such as ion transport proteins, channels, metabolic pumps, etc. to gain access to the pulmonary capillary lumen. To my knowledge, no such mechanisms for DPPC or LB are known. A theoretical explanation might be the fact that the production of DPPC and the exocystosis of DPPC-containing LBs into the alveolar space can be stimulated by stretch. Stretch of the alveoli can switch on Ca2+ entry by either mechanosensitive channels, store-operated channels or second messenger-operated channels, which induces LB exocystosis. Furthermore, an ATP-release mechanism might also be responsible for the pulmonary alveolar mechanotransduction of LB. During diving, transpulmonary pressure changes occur which might induce additional alveolar stretch and thus, theoretically, an extra release of LB. However, whether or not such exocystosis of LB is vascularly orientated remains unclear. Besides which, the leakage of DPPC from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary might also be as simple as a malfunction of the tight junction due to epithelial membrane damage as a result of diving. Finally, it is also possible that DPPC is produced in other non-ATII cells in our body of which we are currently unaware. To conclude, this is an interesting hypothesis regarding the origin of microbubbles. Whether or not DPPC and LB are the main reason for individual sensitivity to DCS remains unclear. Further research will hopefully identify if DPPC and LB are indeed the missing link or just another branch on the big tree of the genesis of decompression sickness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30199886/,2022-11-28 02:53:15 AM
"Trinomial decompression sickness model using full, marginal, and non-event outcomes","Amy E King, Nicholas R Andriano, Laurens E Howle, Amy E King, Nicholas R Andriano, Laurens E Howle",2020 Mar,"Decompression sickness (DCS) is a condition associated with reductions in ambient pressure during underwater diving and altitude exposure. Determining the risk of DCS from a dive exposure remains an active area of research, with the goal of developing safe decompression schedules to mitigate the occurrence of DCS. This work develops a probabilistic model for the trinomial outcome of full, marginal, and no DCS. The model treats full DCS and marginal DCS as separate, fully weighted hierarchical events. Six variants of exponential-exponential (EE) and linear-exponential (LE) decompression models were optimized to fit dive outcomes from the BIG292 empirical human dive trial data of 3322 exposures. Using the log likelihood difference test, the LE1 trinomial marginal model was determined to provide the best fit for the data. The LE1 trinomial marginal model can be used to better understand decompression schedules, expanding upon binomial models which treat marginal DCS as either a fractionally weighted event or a non-event. Future work could investigate whether the use of marginal DCS cases improves multinomial probabilistic DCS model performance. Model improvement could include the addition of a fourth outcome, where full DCS is split and categorized as serious or mild DCS, creating a tetranomial model with serious, mild, marginal, and no DCS outcomes for comparison with the presently developed model.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32174319/,2022-11-28 02:53:16 AM

The goal of the study described here was to assess the feasibility, advantages, diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of contrast transthoracic echocardiography examination (cTTE) using 50% glucose as a contrast agent in comparison with the use of agitated saline as contrast to screen for PFO. In our study, we found that the peak time, effective duration and duration of microbubbles produced by 50% glucose were all longer than those produced by the physiologic saline. The sensitivities for detection of PFO with cTTE using physiologic saline and 50% glucose as contrast were 83% (20/24) and 100% (24/24), respectively. TEE suggested a PFO in 24 patients in two groups. Use of 50% glucose as a contrast agent in cTTE examination enables ultrasound technicians to easily observe the right-to-left shunt across the PFO.

Patients who experience medical emergencies in remote environments are at particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality. For the most serious conditions, delayed contact with Advanced Life Support (ALS) has grave results. Typically, these circumstances involve small groups of individuals and cannot be easily predicted. The waters off the coasts of Maui, Hawaii, however, host millions of residents and visitors annually, with activities including swimming, snorkeling, diving, parasailing, and other types of ocean recreation. As a result, medical and rescue emergencies are not uncommon, many with poor outcomes. Prior to October of 2013, a Coast Guard response boat crew with limited medical training and equipment responded to most off shore cases. Since October 2013, a paramedic from Maui County EMS co-responds aboard the Coast Guard boat with a full complement of ALS equipment.

Severe spinal cord decompression illness after an uneventful North Sea dive,"T P van Rees Vellinga, P J A M van Ooij, F J H van Dijk, T P van Rees Vellinga, P J A M van Ooij, F J H van Dijk",2013 Mar-Apr,"The aim of this case report is to illustrate that, even under moderate conditions, a dive can result in spinal cord decompression illness (DCI). The diver in question completed five dives with the same profile. The first four included substantial physical strain, while the final dive was for observation only, without physical strain. The spinal cord was the target organ for DCI. We discuss the roles of various diver-related risk factors and of factors related to the dive itself. Older divers have a higher risk for decompression incidents. The nature of the dive profile is a major factor in the uptake and release of inert gas. Physical exertion during pressure-exposure boosts the inert gas load, increases bubbling in tissues and raises the risk of DCI in the decompression phase of the dive. We discuss the causal involvement of such risk factors in this case, given the characteristics of the diver and the circumstances of the dive.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a pulse oximeter could provide a useful amount of warning time to a diver with a rebreather after failure of the oxygen addition mechanism. Twenty-eight volunteer human subjects breathed on a mixed-gas rebreather in which the oxygen addition system had been disabled. The subjects were immersed in water in four separate environmental scenarios, including cold and warm water, and monitored using pulse oximeters placed at multiple locations. Pulse oximeters placed on the forehead and clipped on the nasal ala provided a mean of 32 s (±10 s SD) of warning time to divers with falling oxygen levels, prior to risk of loss of consciousness.

We compared an air normobaric condition with a hyperbaric condition in which 10 subjects were subjected to 6 absolute atmospheres of 8.33% O2 Nitrox. In both conditions, subjects performed a between-hand choice-RT task in which we explicitly manipulated the stimulus-response association rule.

Eustachian tube function test as a predictor of middle ear barotrauma,"Konstantin Petrov Georgiev, Nikola Georgiev Shopov, Konstantin Petrov Georgiev, Nikola Georgiev Shopov",2020,"Background:
        
      
      Most of the cases of middle ear barotrauma in divers are due to the impassability of the Eustachian tube. The aim of our study is to compare the results of tympanometry and Valsalva part of Eustachian Tube Function test (ЕТF-test) with the ability of divers to compensate for the change in ambient pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The study included 35 professional divers undergoing annual medical examination. For all subjects is measured first intratympanal pressure at rest, then after the maneuver of Valsalva with impedancemeter. Then a barofunction test (BFT) was performed to assess the diving fitness and the passability of the Eustachian tubes. It consists of divers compressing and decompressing in a hyperbaric chamber to a pressure of 2.2 ATA for 1 minute. Based on results from previous studies we are using a 20 DaPa cutoff point on the ETF test to predict Eustachian tube passability and a successful barofunction test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the current study 24 divers have ETF test results higher than 20 DaPa. 3 divers have ETF test values lower than 20 DaPa in both ears, but none of them displayed difficulties in the BFT. 8 divers have ETF values lower than 20 DaPa in one ear and higher than 20 DaPa in the other. 7 of the last group displayed difficulties with the BFT in the ear with poor ETF result.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We consider that the ETF test can be used to assess diving fitness as a screening method before performing a BFT, as values above 20 DaPa guarantee Eustachian tube function sufficient for diving activities. Values of 20 DaPa and less are not a definite predictor of the BFT results. The results of the ETF test can also be used in the usual work of an otorhinolaryngologist to evaluate Eustachian function in cases of unilateral disease of middle ear.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33001432/,2022-11-28 02:53:21 AM
Evidence of Heritable Determinants of Decompression Sickness in Rats,"Jacky Lautridou, Peter Buzzacott, Marc Belhomme, Emmanuel Dugrenot, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, François Guerrero, Jacky Lautridou, Peter Buzzacott, Marc Belhomme, Emmanuel Dugrenot, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, François Guerrero",2017 Dec,"Introduction:
        
      
      Decompression sickness (DCS) is a complex and poorly understood systemic disease caused by inadequate desaturation after a decrease of ambient pressure. Strong variability between individuals is observed for DCS occurrence. This raises questions concerning factors that may be involved in the interindividual variability of DCS occurrence. This study aimed to experimentally assess the existence of heritable factors involved in DCS occurrence by selectively breeding individuals resistant to DCS from a population stock of Wistar rats.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty-two male and 52 female Wistar rats were submitted to a simulated air dive known to reliably induce about 63% DCS: compression was performed at 100 kPa·min up to 1000 kPa absolute pressure before a 45-min long stay. Decompression was performed at 100 kPa·min with three decompression stops: 5 min at 200 kPa, 5 min at 160 kPa, and 10 min at 130 kPa. Animals were observed for 1 h to detect DCS symptoms. Individuals without DCS were selected and bred to create a new generation, subsequently subjected to the same hyperbaric protocol. This procedure was repeated up to the third generation of rats.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As reported previously, this diving profile induced 67% of DCS, and 33% asymptomatic animals in the founding population. DCS/asymptomatic ratio was not initially different between sexes, although males were heavier than females. In three generations, the outcome of the dive significantly changed from 33% to 67% asymptomatic rats, for both sexes. Interestingly, survival in females increased sooner than in males.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study offers evidence suggesting the inheritance of DCS resistance.

Altered eustachian tube function in SCUBA divers with alternobaric vertigo,"Naoharu Kitajima, Akemi Sugita-Kitajima, Seiji Kitajima, Naoharu Kitajima, Akemi Sugita-Kitajima, Seiji Kitajima",2014 Jun,"Objectives:
        
      
      The number of people participating in sport self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving has increased tremendously, bringing with it a rise in diving accidents. Alternobaric vertigo (AV) is a common problem in SCUBA divers. We investigated the relationship between Eustachian tube function and incidence of AV in sport SCUBA divers. We also followed the progress of these divers after Eustachian tube function improved.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Forty-four patients who experienced a SCUBA diving accident affecting the middle ear (11 men and 33 women; mean ± SD: 37.5 ± 11.5 yr) and 20 healthy volunteer divers who did not experience an accident (6 men and 14 women; mean ± SD: 33.5 ± 13.9 yr) were compared. We divided the divers with an accident into two groups (those with AV vs. those without) and then compared the two groups. All patients regularly underwent Eustachian tube function tests (sonotubometry and impedance test).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In sonotubometry and impedance testing, the mean duration (p < 0.001), amplitude (p < 0.002), and maximum air content (p < 0.05) of divers who experienced a diving accident were significantly different from those of healthy volunteers. However, these parameters in divers with AV did not differ significantly from those in divers without AV. In 7 of 15 divers, vestibular symptoms disappeared immediately after ascent. In the remaining eight divers, however, vertigo/dizziness persisted and even was observed at their first clinic visit.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To prevent AV or barotraumas in SCUBA divers, we recommend a thorough Eustachian tube function evaluation. Any dysfunction should be treated before engaging in SCUBA diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24751737/,2022-11-28 02:53:23 AM
Prevalence of cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy in scuba diving and traffic accident victims,"Petar J Denoble, Craig L Nelson, Shabbar I Ranapurwala, James L Caruso, Petar J Denoble, Craig L Nelson, Shabbar I Ranapurwala, James L Caruso",2014 Mar-Apr,"Although frequently asymptomatic, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent predictor of sudden cardiac death (SCD). We hypothesized that diving may increase the propensity for pre-existent LVH to cause a lethal arrhythmia (and SCD) and therefore the prevalence of LVH may be greater among scuba fatalities than among traffic fatalities. We compared autopsy data for 100 scuba fatalities with 178 traffic fatalities. Extracted data contained information on age, sex, height, body mass, heart mass (HM), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), interventricular wall thickness (IVWT), and degree of coronary artery stenosis. A case was classified as LVH if the LVWT was > 15 mm. Log risk models were used to compare HM and LVWT in two groups while controlling for body mass, body length, age and sex. The prevalence of LVH was compared using Pearson's test. The mean HM was 428.3 +/- 100 for divers and 387 +/- 87 for controls. The crude HM ratio for scuba fatalities vs. controls was 1.11 (1.05, 1.17), and when controlled for sex, age and body mass the ratio was 1.06 (1.01, 1.09). The mean LVWT was 15 +/- 3.5 for divers and 14 +/- 2.7 for controls (p = 0.0017).

The species concept as a cognitive tool for biological anthropology,"Emiliano Bruner, Emiliano Bruner",2013 Jan,"Taxonomy is caught between the search for the ""perfect"" theory and an elusive biological variability. The lack of major advances in issues related to how ""species"" and other taxonomic categories are defined suggests that perhaps we should avoid excessively rigid formalism in this regard. The risk is a separation between elegant but useless theories and confusing applications of the taxonomic tools. Communication is one of the main functions of taxonomy, and stability one of the main parameters that taxonomy users should be sensitive to. An excess of stability may generate anachronistic consequences while continuous revisions may make the tool of taxonomy scarcely practical. The current tendency pushes toward more and more fragmentation of biologically valid taxa. While taxonomy specialists enjoy such challenges, many taxonomy users feel a bit nervous and discouraged when trying to use a tool that is constantly changing. Debates over taxonomy would seem particularly unrewarding for fields with limited samples and scarce biological diversity, such as palaeoanthropology. In this context, where the information available is rarely sufficient to supply consistent taxonomical evidence, there are frequently excessive efforts to create debate on species separations. The risk is that we maintain the debate on a purely theoretical level, or else we distrust a reliable use of taxonomy. A compromise (and recommended) choice between these two extremes would be to rely on shared and reasonable interpretations of homogeneous evolutionary units, without diving into fine-grained issues that will remain, however, unresolved. Taxonomy should be a tool, not the goal, of the evolutionary biologist. Our mind needs discrete and recognizable objects to structure our perception of reality.

          Methods:
        
      
      A matched population of divers with and without a history of DCS were monitored for the production of VGE at 15-minute intervals using ultrasound, following a 405 kPa air dive in a hyperbaric chamber using the DCIEM air decompression table. VGE production was graded using a validated grading system and the data analysed to compare maximum VGE grade and duration of VGE formation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eleven divers with a history of DCS were compared with 13 divers with no history of DCS. Divers with a history of DCS demonstrated both a higher maximum grade (P=0.04) and longer duration (P=0.002) of VGE production compared to divers without a history of DCS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Higher maximum VGE grades and longer durations of VGE following decompression were associated with a history of DCS and, in particular, musculoskeletal DCS. Although the exact mechanism of DCS remains poorly understood, our data suggest some individuals are inherently more prone to develop VGE, increasing the probability of DCS. Modification of diving practices in those with high VGE grades could potentially decrease DCS risk in these individuals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964035/,2022-11-28 02:53:25 AM
Observation and management of retinal changes related to diving in professional divers,"Dan Zhou, Wenbin Wei, Bei Tian, Cong Wang, Xuehui Shi, Xuan Jiao, Dan Zhou, Wenbin Wei, Bei Tian, Cong Wang, Xuehui Shi, Xuan Jiao",2014,"Background:
        
      
      It is very common for professional divers to have damage on the retinas. Severe retinal lesions can profoundly affect athletes' training efficacy and their daily lives. At present, it is not clear if there is effective preventive action. Thus, in our study, we continuously tracked the ocular changes in athletes and closely monitored the risk factors associated with retinal detachment. Also, we analyzed possible interventions, their associated factors, and efficacies for timely preventions to protect the retina from damage in professional divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between 2009 and 2012, a total of 39 professional divers enrolled in follow-up management. The conducted examinations included ocular examination, record screening on retinal lesion, monitoring best-corrected visual acuity, and checking intraocular pressure (IOP) and the scope of retinal lesion. The management included optimizing training methods, taking customized follow-up based on different retinal lesions, laser treatments for definite cases of retinal tear, retinal degeneration caused by retinal layer thinning or vitreous traction, and observing the changes in the scope of retinopathy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Every year, the percentage of divers who have various degrees of retinal lesions is between 43.3% and 56.2%. During the 4 years, there were no statistically significant differences in divers' best-corrected visual acuity and retinal lesions. There were also no statistically significant differences between male and female athletes. However, there were statistically significant differences in IOP during these years. Moreover there were statistically significant differences in IOP and the scope of retinal lesions between platform divers and springboard divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our management of retinal lesions could be effective to prevent severe retinopathy in professional divers. At the same time, platform divers are more likely to have retinal lesions than springboard divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24534231/,2022-11-28 02:53:26 AM
A literature review of immersion pulmonary edema,"Manish Kumar, Paul D Thompson, Manish Kumar, Paul D Thompson",2019 May,"Importance:
        
      
      Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) is a rare but important complication associated with surface swimming and underwater diving. It tends to reoccur and can be fatal. It is not very well-known to clinicians involved in the care of individuals participating in aquatic activities. We performed a systematic review of immersion pulmonary edema to describe the condition and provide guidelines for its management.
    


          Evidence review:
        
      
      We searched PubMed to identify case reports and studies using the MeSH terms ""immersion,"" ""pulmonary edema,"" ""cold-induced,"" ""exercise,"" ""hemodynamics,"" ""water immersion,'' ""cardiovascular response,"" alone and in combinations. We identified 121 relevant articles including 54 case reports. We reviewed in detail 24 studies and all 54 case reports.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The incidence of IPE is estimated to be around 1.1- 1.8%. The risk factors for IPE include age >50 years, female sex, overhydration before exercise, tight wetsuits, cold water exposure and physically trained individuals such as endurance athletes. Individuals with pre-existing heart disease are at increased risk, however, IPE is seen even in healthy individuals. Symptoms such as cough, sputum production, hemoptysis and shortness of breath can occur immediately after immersion. Combination of water immersion, cold exposure, and exercise lead to an increase in pulmonary capillary pressures and eventual pulmonary capillary stress failure that leads to the flooding of alveolar spaces and edema. Conclusion and relevance: Clinicians should be aware of IPE to avoid overestimating the severity of coronary or valvular conditions sometimes coincidentally present in IPE victims. Management is usually supportive. Functional and clinical recovery usually happens spontaneously within 24 h to 2 days, with or without diuretic therapy and a beta-adrenergic agonist. IPE can be recurrent and fatal, hence subjects with a history of IPE should undergo extensive cardiopulmonary investigation and should avoid cold water and physically demanding swimming events or avoid immersion activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30403902/,2022-11-28 02:53:26 AM
Chest CT scan for the screening of air anomalies at risk of pulmonary barotrauma for the initial medical assessment of fitness to dive in a military population,"Brieuc Bonnemaison, Olivier Castagna, Sébastien de Maistre, Jean-Éric Blatteau, Brieuc Bonnemaison, Olivier Castagna, Sébastien de Maistre, Jean-Éric Blatteau",2022 Oct 7,"Introduction: The presence of intra-pulmonary air lesions such as cysts, blebs and emphysema bullae, predisposes to pulmonary barotrauma during pressure variations, especially during underwater diving activities. These rare accidents can have dramatic consequences. Chest radiography has long been the baseline examination for the detection of respiratory pathologies in occupational medicine. It has been replaced since 2018 by the thoracic CT scan for military diving fitness in France. The objective of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of the pulmonary abnormalities of the thoracic CT scan, and to relate them to the characteristics of this population and the results of the spirometry. Methods: 330 records of military diving candidates who underwent an initial assessment between October 2018 and March 2021 were analyzed, in a single-center retrospective analysis. The following data were collected: sex, age, BMI, history of respiratory pathologies and smoking, treatments, allergies, diving practice, results of spirometry, reports of thoracic CT scans, as well as fitness decision. Results: The study included 307 candidates, mostly male, with a median age of 25 years. 19% of the subjects had abnormal spirometry. We identified 25% of divers with CT scan abnormalities. 76% of the abnormal scans were benign nodules, 26% of which measured 6 mm or more. Abnormalities with an aerial component accounted for 13% of the abnormal scans with six emphysema bullae, three bronchial dilatations and one cystic lesion. No association was found between the presence of nodules and the general characteristics of the population, whereas in six subjects emphysema bullae were found statistically associated with active smoking or abnormal spirometry results. Conclusion: The systematic performance of thoracic CT scan in a young population free of pulmonary pathology revealed a majority of benign nodules. Abnormalities with an aerial component are much less frequent, but their presence generally leads to a decision of unfitness. These results argue in favor of a systematic screening of aeric pleuro-pulmonary lesions during the initial assessment for professional divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36277200/,2022-11-28 02:53:27 AM
"Variability in venous gas emboli following the same dive at 3,658 meters","Hayden W Hess, Courtney E Wheelock, Erika St James, Jocelyn L Stooks, Brian M Clemency, David Hostler, Hayden W Hess, Courtney E Wheelock, Erika St James, Jocelyn L Stooks, Brian M Clemency, David Hostler",2021 Second Quarter,"Exposure to a reduction in ambient pressure such as in high-altitude climbing, flying in aircrafts, and decompression from underwater diving results in circulating vascular gas bubbles (i.e., venous gas emboli [VGE]). Incidence and severity of VGE, in part, can objectively quantify decompression stress and risk of decompression sickness (DCS) which is typically mitigated by adherence to decompression schedules. However, dives conducted at altitude challenge recommendations for decompression schedules which are limited to exposures of 10,000 feet in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual (Rev. 7). Therefore, in an ancillary analysis within a larger study, we assessed the evolution of VGE for two hours post-dive using echocardiography following simulated altitude dives at 12,000 feet. Ten divers completed two dives to 66 fsw (equivalent to 110 fsw at sea level by the Cross correction method) for 30 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber. All dives were completed following a 60-minute exposure at 12,000 feet. Following the dive, the chamber was decompressed back to altitude for two hours. Echocardiograph measurements were performed every 20 minutes post-dive. Bubbles were counted and graded using the Germonpré and Eftedal and Brubakk method, respectively. No diver presented with symptoms of DCS following the dive or two hours post-dive at altitude. Despite inter- and intra-diver variability of VGE grade following the dives, the majority (11/20 dives) presented a peak VGE Grade 0, three VGE Grade 1, one VGE Grade 2, four VGE Grade 3, and one VGE Grade 4. Using the Cross correction method for a 66-fsw dive at 12,000 feet of altitude resulted in a relatively low decompression stress and no cases of DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975402/,2022-11-28 02:53:28 AM
Brain damage in commercial breath-hold divers,"Kiyotaka Kohshi, Hideki Tamaki, Frédéric Lemaître, Toshio Okudera, Tatsuya Ishitake, Petar J Denoble, Kiyotaka Kohshi, Hideki Tamaki, Frédéric Lemaître, Toshio Okudera, Tatsuya Ishitake, Petar J Denoble",2014 Aug 12,"Background:
        
      
      Acute decompression illness (DCI) involving the brain (Cerebral DCI) is one of the most serious forms of diving-related injuries which may leave residual brain damage. Cerebral DCI occurs in compressed air and in breath-hold divers, likewise. We conducted this study to investigate whether long-term breath-hold divers who may be exposed to repeated symptomatic and asymptomatic brain injuries, show brain damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      Our study subjects were 12 commercial breath-hold divers (Ama) with long histories of diving work in a district of Japan. We obtained information on their diving practices and the presence or absence of medical problems, especially DCI events. All participants were examined with MRI to determine the prevalence of brain lesions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 12 Ama divers (mean age: 54.9±5.1 years), four had histories of cerebral DCI events, and 11 divers demonstrated ischemic lesions of the brain on MRI studies. The lesions were situated in the cortical and/or subcortical area (9 cases), white matters (4 cases), the basal ganglia (4 cases), and the thalamus (1 case). Subdural fluid collections were seen in 2 cases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These results suggest that commercial breath-hold divers are at a risk of clinical or subclinical brain injury which may affect the long-term neuropsychological health of divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25115903/,2022-11-28 02:53:29 AM
"Microvessel density, lipid chemistry and N2 solubility in human and pig adipose tissue","Molly K Gabler-Smith, Andrew J Westgate, Heather N Koopman, Molly K Gabler-Smith, Andrew J Westgate, Heather N Koopman",2020 First Quarter,"Decompression sickness (DCS) occurs when nitrogen gas (N2) comes out of solution too quickly, forming bubbles in the blood and tissues. These bubbles can be a serious condition; thus it is of extreme interest in the dive community to model DCS risk. Diving models use tissue compartments to calculate tissue partial pressures, often using data obtained from other mammalian species (i.e., pigs). Adipose tissue is an important compartment in these models because N2 is five times more soluble in fat than in blood; at any blood/tissue interface N2 will diffuse into the fat and can lead to bubble formation on ascent. Little is known about many characteristics of adipose tissue relevant to diving physiology. Therefore, we measured microvessel density and morphology, lipid composition, and N2 solubility in adipose tissue from humans and pigs. Human adipose tissue has significantly higher microvascular density (1.79 ± 0.04 vs. 1.21 ± 0.30%), vessel diameter (10.25 ± 0.28 vs. 6.72 ± 0.60 µm), total monounsaturated fatty acids (50.1 vs. 41.2 mol%) and N2 solubility (0.061 ± 0.003 vs. 0.054 ± 0.004 mL N2 mL⁻ ¹ oil) compared to pig tissue. Pig adipose tissue has significantly higher lipid content (76.1 ± 4.9 vs. 64.6 ± 5.1%) and total saturated fatty acids (38.8 vs. 29.5 mol%). Though two important components in gas kinetics within adipose tissue during diving (blood flow rates and degree of perfusion) are not well understood, our results indicate differences between the adipose tissue of humans and pigs. This suggests data from swine may not exactly predict gas dynamics for estimating DCS in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32176941/,2022-11-28 02:53:30 AM
Dysbaric osteonecrosis of the humeral head in a patient with type 2 decompressive sickness,"Lin Cheng, Pedro Silva, Raef Dahab, Lin Cheng, Pedro Silva, Raef Dahab",2021 Jul 21,"Introduction:
        
      
      Dysbaric osteonecrosis, albeit rare, have been reported in patients with decompression sickness. We report a patient with dysbaric osteonecrosis, diagnosed 60 days after presenting with decompression sickness.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      A 38-year-old, previously fit and healthy male, noted his tank running out of air at approximately 40-50 m while diving, surfaced rapidly before losing consciousness. Upon gaining consciousness, he noted loss of power on all four limbs. He completed 26 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Magnetic resonance (MR) of the spine noted T2 abnormality in the upper cervical spine, with some involvement of the central grey matter and the remainder of the cord. According to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, it was noted clinically that the patient had a T9 neurological level with ASIA impairment scale A. MR imaging (MRI) of the shoulder was performed, 60 days since initial presentation, after the patient complained of shoulder pain, noted non-specific subcortical oedema of the humeral head, which suggested early osteonecrosis.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Dysbaric osteonecrosis is rare but remains extremely important to be recognised as a potential complication from decompressive sickness. The increased risk of pathological fractures with dysbaric osteonecrosis plays an important role as it may alter the rehabilitation prescription. One of the unique features of this case, apart from its rarity, was that it was diagnosed 60 days from his initial presentation, when he has passed his acute phase of illness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34290228/,2022-11-28 02:53:31 AM

      Epidemiological information on injury/illness is required to develop effective injury prevention strategies.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To assess the frequency and characteristics of injuries/illnesses (1) in the 4 weeks prior to and (2) during the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) World Championships 2015 compared with 2013 and 2009.
    


          Method:
        
      
      (1) Athletes answered a retrospective questionnaire, and (2) the medical staff reported injuries/illnesses prospectively during the championships.
    


          Results:
        
      
      (1) A quarter of responding athletes reported symptoms in the 4 weeks prior to the championships. More than half of all affected athletes presented with substantial severity, 80% took medication, 70% had overuse injuries and 30% did not modify their training regime despite symptoms. At the start of the championships, 70% of affected participants were still symptomatic. (2) During the championships, injury and illness incidence was 12.9 per 100 athletes. The most common injuries were shoulder sprains (5.7%) and muscle cramps of the lower back (5.7%). The most common illnesses were infections of the respiratory (33.9%) and gastrointestinal tract (23.5%). Risk factors included discipline and age, but not gender. Incidence was highest in athletes competing in high diving (HD), water polo (WP) and diving (DIV) for injuries, and WP and swimming (SW) for illnesses. The significantly higher incidence of injuries and illnesses at the FINA World Championships 2015 compared with 2013 and 2009 was most probably due to a similarly improved response rate of the medical staff.

"Antibacterial and anatomical defenses in an oil contaminated, vulnerable seaduck","Anders Pape Møller, Karsten Laursen, Jorge Izaguirre, Alfonso Marzal, Anders Pape Møller, Karsten Laursen, Jorge Izaguirre, Alfonso Marzal",2021 Aug 19,"Oil spills have killed thousands of birds during the last 100 years, but nonlethal effects of oil spills on birds remain poorly studied. We measured phenotype characters in 819 eiders Somateria mollissima (279 whole birds and 540 wings) of which 13.6% were oiled. We tested the hypotheses that (a) the morphology of eiders does not change due to oil contamination; (b) the anatomy of organs reflects the physiological reaction to contamination, for example, increase in metabolic demand, increase in food intake, and counteracting toxic effects of oil; (c) large locomotion apparatus that facilitates locomotion increases the risk of getting oiled; and (d) individual eiders with a higher production of secretions from the uropygial grand were more likely to have oil on their plumage. We tested whether 19 characters differed between oiled and nonoiled individuals, showing a consistent pattern. The final model retained seven predictor variables showing relationships between eiders contaminated with oil and food consumption, flight, and diving abilities. We tested whether these effects were due to differences in body condition, liver mass, empty gizzard mass, or other characters that could have been affected by impaired flight and diving ability. There was no evidence of such negative impact of oiling on eiders. We found that significant exposure to oil was associated with increased diversity of antibacterial defense. Oiled eiders did not constitute a random sample, and superior diving ability as reflected by large foot area was at a selective disadvantage during oil spills. Thus, specific characteristics predispose eiders to oiling, with an adaptation to swimming, diving, and flying being traded against the costs of oiling. In contrast, individuals with a high degree of physiological plasticity may experience an advantage because their uropygial secretions counteract the effects of oil contamination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594517/,2022-11-28 02:53:32 AM

In cases of extreme floods, divers play a particularly important role in rescuing and first-response activities. Rescuing in contaminated floodwaters means that the used equipment such as diving suits should be disinfected afterwards. The need for securing the implementation of minimal health and safety measures for involved rescuers is paramount. Data regarding injuries and disease occurrences among rescuers are relatively scarce, indicating the need for medical surveillance systems that would monitor and record all injuries and disease occurrences among rescuers in order to ensure sound epidemiological data.

Sustained apnea induces endothelial activation,"Lars Eichhorn, Ramona Dolscheid-Pommerich, Felix Erdfelder, Muhammad Ajmal Ayub, Theresa Schmitz, Nikos Werner, Felix Jansen, Lars Eichhorn, Ramona Dolscheid-Pommerich, Felix Erdfelder, Muhammad Ajmal Ayub, Theresa Schmitz, Nikos Werner, Felix Jansen",2017 Sep,"Background:
        
      
      Apnea diving has gained worldwide popularity, even though the pathophysiological consequences of this challenging sport on the human body are poorly investigated and understood. This study aims to assess the influence of sustained apnea in healthy volunteers on circulating microparticles (MPs) and microRNAs (miRs), which are established biomarkers reflecting vascular function.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      Short intermittent hypoxia due to voluntary breath-holding affects circulating levels of endothelial cell-derived MPs (EMPs) and endothelial cell-derived miRs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Under dry laboratory conditions, 10 trained apneic divers performed maximal breath-hold. Venous blood samples were taken, once before and at 4 defined points in time after apnea. Samples were analyzed for circulating EMPs and endothelial miRs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Average apnea time was 329 seconds (±103), and SpO2 at the end of apnea was 79% (±12). Apnea was associated with a time-dependent increase of circulating endothelial cell-derived EMPs and endothelial miRs. Levels of circulating EMPs in the bloodstream reached a peak 4 hours after the apnea period and returned to baseline levels after 24 hours. Circulating miR-126 levels were elevated at all time points after a single voluntary maximal apnea, whereas miR-26 levels were elevated significantly only after 30 minutes and 4 hours. Also miR-21 and miR-92 levels increased, but did not reach the level of significance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Even a single maximal breath-hold induces acute endothelial activation and should be performed with great caution by subjects with preexisting vascular diseases. Voluntary apnea might be used as a model to simulate changes in endothelial function caused by hypoxia in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28464406/,2022-11-28 02:53:34 AM
An adaptive transgenerational effect of warming but not of pesticide exposure determines how a pesticide and warming interact for antipredator behaviour,"Tam T Tran, Lizanne Janssens, Khuong V Dinh, Robby Stoks, Tam T Tran, Lizanne Janssens, Khuong V Dinh, Robby Stoks",2019 Feb,"The impact of pesticides on organisms may strongly depend on temperature. While many species will be exposed to pesticides and warming both in the parental and offspring generations, transgenerational effects of pesticides under warming are still poorly studied, particularly for behaviour. We therefore studied the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and warming both within and across generations on antipredator behaviour of larvae of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Within each generation pesticide exposure and warming reduced the escape diving time, making the larvae more susceptible to predation. Pesticide exposure of the parents did not affect offspring antipredator behaviour. Yet, parental exposure to warming determined how warming and the pesticide interacted in the offspring generation. When parents were reared at 24 °C, warming no longer reduced offspring diving times in the solvent control, suggesting an adaptive transgenerational effect to prepare the offspring to better deal with a higher predation risk under warming. Related to this, the CPF-induced reduction in diving time was stronger at 20 °C than at 24 °C, except in the offspring whose parents had been exposed to 24 °C. This dependency of the widespread interaction between warming and pesticide exposure on an adaptive transgenerational effect of warming is an important finding at the interface of global change ecology and ecotoxicology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30447473/,2022-11-28 02:53:35 AM

      Prolonged breath holding results in hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Compensatory mechanisms help maintain adequate oxygen supply to hypoxia sensitive organs, but burden the cardiovascular system. The aim was to investigate human compensatory mechanisms and their effects on the cardiovascular system with regard to cardiac function and morphology, blood flow redistribution, serum biomarkers of the adrenergic system and myocardial injury markers following prolonged apnoea.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventeen elite apnoea divers performed maximal breath-hold during cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Two breath-hold sessions were performed to assess (1) cardiac function, myocardial tissue properties and (2) blood flow. In between CMR sessions, a head MRI was performed for the assessment of signs of silent brain ischemia. Urine and blood samples were analysed prior to and up to 4 h after the first breath-hold.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean breath-hold time was 297 ± 52 s. Left ventricular (LV) end-systolic, end-diastolic, and stroke volume increased significantly (p < 0.05). Peripheral oxygen saturation, LV ejection fraction, LV fractional shortening, and heart rate decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Blood distribution was diverted to cerebral regions with no significant changes in the descending aorta. Catecholamine levels, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, and NT-pro-BNP levels increased significantly, but did not reach pathological levels.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Compensatory effects of prolonged apnoea substantially burden the cardiovascular system. CMR tissue characterisation did not reveal acute myocardial injury, indicating that the resulting cardiovascular stress does not exceed compensatory physiological limits in healthy subjects. However, these compensatory mechanisms could overly tax those limits in subjects with pre-existing cardiac disease. For divers interested in competetive apnoea diving, a comprehensive medical exam with a special focus on the cardiovascular system may be warranted.

This study investigated and compared the effect of pre-dive oxygenation, pre-dive whole body vibration or a combination of both on post-dive bubble formation. Methods: Six healthy volunteers performed 6 no-decompression dives each, to a depth of 33 mfw for 20 min (3 control dives without preconditioning and 1 of each preconditioning protocol) with a minimum interval of 1 week between each dive. Post-dive bubbles were counted in the precordium by two-dimensional echocardiography, 30 and 90 min after the dive, with and without knee flexing. Each diver served as his own control. Results: Vascular gas emboli (VGE) were systematically observed before and after knee flexing at each post-dive measurement. Compared to the control dives, we observed a decrease in VGE count of 23.8 ± 7.4% after oxygen breathing (p < 0.05), 84.1 ± 5.6% after vibration (p < 0.001), and 55.1 ± 9.6% after vibration combined with oxygen (p < 0.001). The difference between all preconditioning methods was statistically significant. Conclusions: The precise mechanism that induces the decrease in post-dive VGE and thus makes the diver more resistant to decompression stress is still not known. However, it seems that a pre-dive mechanical reduction of existing gas nuclei might best explain the beneficial effects of this strategy. The apparent non-synergic effect of oxygen and vibration has probably to be understood because of different mechanisms involved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27965591/,2022-11-28 02:53:37 AM
The use of Spielberger's State-Trait Personality Inventory (trait anxiety subscale) with naval subaquatic specialists,"Charles H Van Wijk, Charles H Van Wijk",2014 Dec,"Objectives:
        
      
      Panic behavior poses a particular threat to the health and safety of subaquatic occupational specialists. Trait anxiety has previously been identified as a marker of panic behavior under water, and Spielberger's State-Trait Personality Inventory (trait anxiety subscale) has been previously used to measure trait anxiety among subaquatic specialists. Using archived data, the trait anxiety scores of subaquatic specialists were analyzed to meet 3 objectives: 1stly - to develop a trait anxiety profile of subaquatic specialists; 2ndly - to investigate the predictive value of trait anxiety measures upon entering an occupational field; and 3rdly - to establish the reliability of these scores over time.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Archival trait-anxiety data from 322 subjects were analyzed statistically.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis of the available scores revealed a highly homogenous as well as a very low trait anxiety profile for the investigated occupational group. Additionally, low trait anxiety was somewhat associated with success during specialist training: fewer candidates with high trait anxiety scores completed their qualification. Moreover, measurement of trait anxiety was stable over time, which suggests that when scores for this occupational group are screened, deviations from previous scores could signify a potential need for referral to an intervention from health professionals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using the trait anxiety subscale as part of occupational health surveillance of subaquatic specialists could support prevention of accidents by identifying high-risk candidates during their annual health assessments, and referral for timeous intervention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25503890/,2022-11-28 02:53:37 AM
Abundance and Distribution of Sperm Whales in the Canary Islands: Can Sperm Whales in the Archipelago Sustain the Current Level of Ship-Strike Mortalities?,"Andrea Fais, Tim P Lewis, Daniel P Zitterbart, Omar Álvarez, Ana Tejedor, Natacha Aguilar Soto, Andrea Fais, Tim P Lewis, Daniel P Zitterbart, Omar Álvarez, Ana Tejedor, Natacha Aguilar Soto",2016 Mar 21,"Sperm whales are present in the Canary Islands year-round, suggesting that the archipelago is an important area for this species in the North Atlantic. However, the area experiences one of the highest reported rates of sperm whale ship-strike in the world. Here we investigate if the number of sperm whales found in the archipelago can sustain the current rate of ship-strike mortality. The results of this study may also have implications for offshore areas where concentrations of sperm whales may coincide with high densities of ship traffic, but where ship-strikes may be undocumented. The absolute abundance of sperm whales in an area of 52933 km2, covering the territorial waters of the Canary Islands, was estimated from 2668 km of acoustic line-transect survey using Distance sampling analysis. Data on sperm whale diving and acoustic behaviour, obtained from bio-logging, were used to calculate g(0) = 0.92, this is less than one because of occasional extended periods when whales do not echolocate. This resulted in an absolute abundance estimate of 224 sperm whales (95% log-normal CI 120-418) within the survey area. The recruitment capability of this number of whales, some 2.5 whales per year, is likely to be exceeded by the current ship-strike mortality rate. Furthermore, we found areas of higher whale density within the archipelago, many coincident with those previously described, suggesting that these are important habitats for females and immature animals inhabiting the archipelago. Some of these areas are crossed by active shipping lanes increasing the risk of ship-strikes. Given the philopatry in female sperm whales, replacement of impacted whales might be limited. Therefore, the application of mitigation measures to reduce the ship-strike mortality rate seems essential for the conservation of sperm whales in the Canary Islands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26999791/,2022-11-28 02:53:38 AM
Increased carotid intima-media thickness in scuba divers,"Masoud Mehrpour, Saeed Rezaali, Narges Sadat Shams-Hosseini, Masoud Mehrpour, Saeed Rezaali, Narges Sadat Shams-Hosseini",2014,"Background:
        
      
      Scuba divers work in high pressure conditions which may cause some changes in physiological status to adapt to this situation. In this study, the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was assessed in divers as a risk factor of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This historical cohort study was performed on 16 male professional scuba divers as case group and 30 healthy people as controls with age range of 26-66 years. CIMT of both carotids of supine participants was measured by a 10 MHz linear ultrasonic probe quantitatively. Relationship between experience of diving and carotid IMT was evaluated.

Brief screening test of ventilatory sensitivity to CO₂ cannot replace the mandatory test for susceptibility to CNS oxygen toxicity,"Ran Arieli, Mirit Eynan, Dror Ofir, Yehuda Arieli, Ran Arieli, Mirit Eynan, Dror Ofir, Yehuda Arieli",2014 Aug,"Central nervous system oxygen toxicity is a major risk in closed-circuit diving, and the risk increases with elevation of the inspired carbon dioxide (CO2). Mandatory tests for CO2 retention and detection are common practice at the Israel Naval Medical Institute, for the instruction and selection of combat divers at an advanced stage in their training. Read test is a simpler test of the ventilatory response to CO2. Positive correlation between parameters from Read and mandatory tests, enable conducting the test at an earlier stage in diving candidates. In the mandatory test, divers (n = 45) breathing various levels of CO2 in oxygen, and tested for the detection and retention of CO2 reported their sensations. In the Read test, we recorded end-tidal CO2 and ventilation in subjects as they rebreathed from rubber bag. The slope of ventilation was calculated as a function of end-tidal CO2. There was low correlation between any of the parameters from our test and the Read test. There was low insignificant correlation between any parameter from the Read test and detection or retention of CO2.

Observed decompression sickness and venous bubbles following 18-msw dive profiles using RN Table 11,"S Lesley Blogg, Andreas Møllerløkken, Mikael Gennser, S Lesley Blogg, Andreas Møllerløkken, Mikael Gennser",2017 May-Jun,"The venous bubble load in the body after diving may be used to infer risk of decompression sickness (DCS). Retrospective analysis of post-dive bubbling and DCS was made on seven studies. Each of these investigated interventions, using an 18 meters of sea water (msw) air dive profile from Royal Navy Table 11 (Mod Air Table), equivalent to the Norwegian Air tables. A recent neurological DCS case suggested this table was not safe as thought. Two-hundred and twenty (220) man-dives were completed on this profile. Bubble measurements were made following 219 man-dives, using Doppler or 2D ultrasound measurements made on the Kisman-Masurel and Eftedal-Brubakk scales, respectively. The overall median grade was KM/EB 0.5 and the overall median maximum grade was KM/EB 2. Two cases of transient shoulder discomfort (""niggles"") were observed (0.9% (95% CL 0.1% - 3.3%)) and were treated with surface oxygen. One dive, for which no bubble measurements were made, resulted in a neurological DCS treated with hyperbaric oxygen. The DCS risk of this profile is below that predicted by models, and comparison of the cumulative incidence of DCS of these data to the large dataset compiled by DCIEM [1, 2] show that the incidence is lower than might be expected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28779578/,2022-11-28 02:53:40 AM
Marine foraging ecology influences mercury bioaccumulation in deep-diving northern elephant seals,"Sarah H Peterson, Joshua T Ackerman, Daniel P Costa, Sarah H Peterson, Joshua T Ackerman, Daniel P Costa",2015 Jul 7,"Mercury contamination of oceans is prevalent worldwide and methylmercury concentrations in the mesopelagic zone (200-1000 m) are increasing more rapidly than in surface waters. Yet mercury bioaccumulation in mesopelagic predators has been understudied. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) biannually travel thousands of kilometres to forage within coastal and open-ocean regions of the northeast Pacific Ocean. We coupled satellite telemetry, diving behaviour and stable isotopes (carbon and nitrogen) from 77 adult females, and showed that variability among individuals in foraging location, diving depth and δ(13)C values were correlated with mercury concentrations in blood and muscle. We identified three clusters of foraging strategies, and these resulted in substantially different mercury concentrations: (i) deeper-diving and offshore-foraging seals had the greatest mercury concentrations, (ii) shallower-diving and offshore-foraging seals had intermediate levels, and (iii) coastal and more northerly foraging seals had the lowest mercury concentrations. Additionally, mercury concentrations were lower at the end of the seven-month-long foraging trip (n = 31) than after the two-month- long post-breeding trip (n = 46). Our results indicate that foraging behaviour influences mercury exposure and mesopelagic predators foraging in the northeast Pacific Ocean may be at high risk for mercury bioaccumulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26085591/,2022-11-28 02:53:41 AM
A rat model of chronic moderate alcohol consumption and risk of decompression sickness,"Peter Buzzacott, Aleksandra Mazur, Qiong Wang, Kate Lambrechts, Michael Theron, François Guerrero, Peter Buzzacott, Aleksandra Mazur, Qiong Wang, Kate Lambrechts, Michael Theron, François Guerrero",2015 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study aimed to establish if chronic, moderate, pre-dive alcohol consumption had any affect upon susceptibility to decompression sickness (DCS) in rats.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A treatment group of 15 rats were given water containing 12 mL ·L ⁻¹ of ethanol for four weeks. Controls (n = 15) were given water. Both groups were compressed with air to 1,000 kPa, followed by staged decompression. An additional 30 control rats from a similar previous experiment were added, raising the control-treatment ratio to 3:1.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Rats in the treatment group consumed the equivalent of an 80 kg man drinking 2 L of 5 % alcohol by volume beer per day, which is three times the recommended daily limit for men. Overall, comparing the treatment group with the combined control groups neither weight (P = 0.23) nor alcohol consumption (P = 0.69) were associated with DCS.
    


          Discussion:

Beaked whales and state-dependent decision-making: how does body condition affect the trade-off between foraging and predator avoidance?,"Eilidh Siegal, Sascha K Hooker, Saana Isojunno, Patrick J O Miller, Eilidh Siegal, Sascha K Hooker, Saana Isojunno, Patrick J O Miller",2022 Jan 26,"Body condition is central to how animals balance foraging with predator avoidance-a trade-off that fundamentally affects animal fitness. Animals in poor condition may accept greater predation risk to satisfy current foraging 'needs', while those in good condition may be more risk averse to protect future 'assets'. These state-dependent behavioural predictions can help interpret responses to human activities, but are little explored in marine animals. This study investigates the influence of body condition on how beaked whales trade-off foraging and predator avoidance. Body density (indicating lipid-energy stores) was estimated for 15 foraging northern bottlenose whales tagged near Jan Mayen, Norway. Composite indices of foraging (diving and echolocation clicks) and anti-predation (long ascents, non-foraging dives and silent periods reducing predator eavesdropping) were negatively related. Experimental sonar exposures led to decreased foraging and increased risk aversion, confirming a foraging/perceived safety trade-off. However, lower lipid stores were not related to a decrease in predator avoidance versus foraging, i.e. worse condition animals did not prioritize foraging. Individual differences (personalities) or reproductive context could offer alternative explanations for the observed state-behaviour relationships. This study provides evidence of foraging/predator-avoidance trade-offs in a marine top predator and demonstrates that animals in worse condition might not always take more risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35078370/,2022-11-28 02:53:42 AM
Initial Severity Scoring and Residual Deficit in Scuba Divers with Inner Ear Decompression Sickness,"Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, Sébastien de Maistre, Jean-Baptiste Morvan, Nicolas Vallée, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, Sébastien de Maistre, Jean-Baptiste Morvan, Nicolas Vallée, Jean-Eric Blatteau",2016 Aug,"Background:
        
      
      Inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) in scuba diving results in residual vestibulocochlear deficits with a potential impact on health-related quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive factors for poor clinical recovery and to try to establish a prognostic score on initial physical examination.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The medical records of injured divers with IEDCS treated in our facility between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical severity of the deficit was evaluated on admission using a numerical scoring system taking into account the intensity of vestibular symptoms and the presence of cochlear signs. The clinical outcome was assessed at 3 mo by telephone interview. After multivariate analysis of potential risk factors for sequelae, the discriminating value of the score and these prognostic reliability indices were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among the 99 patients included in the study, 24% still had residual symptoms. Statistical analysis revealed that only a high clinical score [OR = 1.39 (95% CI 1.13-1.71)] and a delay in hyperbaric recompression >6 h [OR = 1.001 (95% CI 1-1.003)] were independently associated with incomplete recovery. The advantage of the score lay in its highly specific nature (92%) rather than its sensitivity (48%) for a threshold of 10.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Results suggest that the severity of IEDCS can be easily determined by a clinical score during the acute phase. Recompression treatment should not be delayed.

The evaluation of in-chamber sound levels during hyperbaric oxygen applications: Results of 41 centres,"Taylan Zaman, Abdusselam Celebi, Bengusu Mirasoglu, Akin Savas Toklu, Taylan Zaman, Abdusselam Celebi, Bengusu Mirasoglu, Akin Savas Toklu",2020 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Noise has physical and psychological effects on humans. Recommended exposure limits are exceeded in many hospital settings; however, information about sound levels in hyperbaric oxygen treatment chambers is lacking. This study measured in-chamber sound levels during treatments in Turkish hyperbaric centres.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sound levels were measured using a sound level meter (decibel meter). All chambers were multiplace with similar dimensions and shapes. Eight measurements were performed in each of 41 chambers; three during compression, three during decompression, and two at treatment pressure, one during chamber ventilation (flushing) and one without ventilation. At each measurement a sound sample was collected for 25 seconds and A-weighted equivalent (LAeq) and C-weighted peak (LCpeak) levels were obtained. Recorded values were evaluated in relation to sound level limits in regulations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The highest sound level measured in the study was 100.4 dB(A) at treatment pressure while ventilation was underway and the lowest was 40.5 dB(A) at treatment pressure without ventilation. Most centres had sound levels between 70 dB and 85 dB throughout the treatment. Ventilation caused significant augmentation of noise.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The chambers were generally safe in terms of noise exposure. Nevertheless, hyperbaric chambers can be very noisy environments so could pose a risk for noise-related health problems. Therefore, they should be equipped with appropriate noise control systems. Silencers are effective in reducing noise in chambers. Thus far, hyperbaric noise research has focused on chambers used for commercial diving. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate noise in hospital-based chambers during medical treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957126/,2022-11-28 02:53:44 AM
Prevalence of Barotrauma in Recreational Scuba Divers After Repetitive Saltwater Dives,"Stefanie Jansen, Moritz Friedo Meyer, Manuela Boor, Moritz Felsch, Heinz-Dieter Kluenter, Eberhard Daniel Pracht, Karl-Bernd Hüttenbrink, Dirk Beutner, Maria Grosheva, Stefanie Jansen, Moritz Friedo Meyer, Manuela Boor, Moritz Felsch, Heinz-Dieter Kluenter, Eberhard Daniel Pracht, Karl-Bernd Hüttenbrink, Dirk Beutner, Maria Grosheva",2016 Oct,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim was to investigate the prevalence of middle ear barotrauma (MEB) and to establish risk factors of MEB after repeated saltwater dives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective observational cohort study 28 divers were examined over 6 consecutive days of diving in the Red Sea, Egypt. Participants underwent an otoscopic examination before the first dive, between each dive and after the last dive. In addition, they performed Valsalva maneuver (VM) and were questioned about dive-related complaints. Otoscopic findings were classified according to TEED classification for MEB (0 = normal otoscopy to 4 = perforation) separately for each ear. First examination was conducted before the first dive. Final examination, including a questionnaire, was conducted at least 12 h after the last dive.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 436 dives were performed and 1161 otoscopic findings were analyzed. All participants showed a normal eardrum and a positive VM during initial exam. MEB prevalence (TEED >0) was 36.5% at final examination. Prevalence increased significantly with number of dives per day (p < 0.001) as with number of diving days (p = 0.032). Neither depth nor duration of dives significantly influenced MEB prevalence (all p > 0.05). More experienced divers (>200 dives lifetime) showed significantly less barotrauma (p < 0.0001). Despite the high prevalence of MEB, 81.7% (316 of 387) of all dives were reported asymptomatic.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      After 6 days of repetitive diving, MEB prevalence was high (36.5%). It was the most often cause of otalgia in divers. Cumulative pressure exposure during repetitive dives resulted in significant increase of MEB. Diving experience significantly reduced the MEB prevalence. Interestingly, the severity of MEB did not correlate with subjective complaints.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27636390/,2022-11-28 02:53:45 AM
The probability and severity of decompression sickness,"Laurens E Howle, Paul W Weber, Ethan A Hada, Richard D Vann, Petar J Denoble, Laurens E Howle, Paul W Weber, Ethan A Hada, Richard D Vann, Petar J Denoble",2017 Mar 15,"Decompression sickness (DCS), which is caused by inert gas bubbles in tissues, is an injury of concern for scuba divers, compressed air workers, astronauts, and aviators. Case reports for 3322 air and N2-O2 dives, resulting in 190 DCS events, were retrospectively analyzed and the outcomes were scored as (1) serious neurological, (2) cardiopulmonary, (3) mild neurological, (4) pain, (5) lymphatic or skin, and (6) constitutional or nonspecific manifestations. Following standard U.S. Navy medical definitions, the data were grouped into mild-Type I (manifestations 4-6)-and serious-Type II (manifestations 1-3). Additionally, we considered an alternative grouping of mild-Type A (manifestations 3-6)-and serious-Type B (manifestations 1 and 2). The current U.S. Navy guidance allows for a 2% probability of mild DCS and a 0.1% probability of serious DCS. We developed a hierarchical trinomial (3-state) probabilistic DCS model that simultaneously predicts the probability of mild and serious DCS given a dive exposure. Both the Type I/II and Type A/B discriminations of mild and serious DCS resulted in a highly significant (p << 0.01) improvement in trinomial model fit over the binomial (2-state) model. With the Type I/II definition, we found that the predicted probability of 'mild' DCS resulted in a longer allowable bottom time for the same 2% limit. However, for the 0.1% serious DCS limit, we found a vastly decreased allowable bottom dive time for all dive depths. If the Type A/B scoring was assigned to outcome severity, the no decompression limits (NDL) for air dives were still controlled by the acceptable serious DCS risk limit rather than the acceptable mild DCS risk limit. However, in this case, longer NDL limits were allowed than with the Type I/II scoring. The trinomial model mild and serious probabilities agree reasonably well with the current air NDL only with the Type A/B scoring and when 0.2% risk of serious DCS is allowed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28296928/,2022-11-28 02:53:46 AM

Among them, 42 (35%) water samples and 28 (47%) sediment samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium. The concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the water samples was 0-8/10 L and 0-260/g in sediment samples. Results revealed that July was the highest risk period for both swimming and diving with an estimated probability of infection from swimming of greater than 18 per 10,000 swim sessions. It was concluded that swimming or diving in Yunlong Lake has a higher risk of Cryptosporidium infection than the acceptable risk level set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and left ventricular hypertrophy in recreational scuba divers,"Peter Buzzacott, George Anderson, Frauke Tillmans, James W Grier, Petar J Denoble, Peter Buzzacott, George Anderson, Frauke Tillmans, James W Grier, Petar J Denoble",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aims of this study were to investigate the potential impact of age, sex and body mass index (BMI) upon the incidence of arrhythmias pre- and post- diving, and to identify the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in older recreational divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Divers aged ≥ 40 years participating in group dive trips had ECG rhythm and echocardiograph recordings before and after diving. Arrhythmias were confirmed by an experienced human reader. LVH was identified by two-dimensional echocardiography. Weighted (0.5 fractional) values were used to account for participation by seven divers in 14 trips.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-seven divers undertook 84 dive trips and recorded 677 dives. Among divers with no pre-trip arrhythmias (n = 55), we observed that 6.5 (12%) recorded post-trip arrhythmias and the median increase was 1.0 arrhythmia. In divers with pre-trip arrhythmias, 14.5 had a median of 1.0 fewer post-trip arrhythmias, 2.0 had no change and 5.5 had a median of 16.0 greater. Age, but neither sex nor BMI, was associated with change in the number of arrhythmias before and after dive trips (P = 0.02). The relative risk for experiencing a change in the frequency of arrhythmias after a diver trip, was 2.1 for each additional 10 years of age (95% CI 1.1, 4.0). Of the 60 divers with imaging of their heart, five had left ventricular hypertrophy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We observed a higher than expected prevalence of arrhythmias. Divers with pre-trip arrhythmias tended to be older than divers without pre-trip arrhythmias (P = 0.02). The prevalence of LVH in our cohort was one quarter of that found post-mortem in scuba fatalities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157735/,2022-11-28 02:53:47 AM

          Methods:
        
      
      Searches were made of the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific Diving Mortality Database; the International Shark Attack File website; the Australian Shark Attack File and the Global Shark Attack File to identify cases of fatal shark attacks on divers in Australia. In addition, a systematic search of published medical and sporting literature was conducted to identify relevant reports. The data collected were scrutinised for relevance and duplication.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 187 recorded attacks on divers, comprising 112 snorkellers, 62 scuba divers and 13 on divers using surface-supplied breathing apparatus. These included 28 verified deaths: 13 involving snorkellers, eight involving scuba divers, and seven divers using surface-supply. The victims' ages ranged from 13-50 years (mean 31 years). All but three were males. The vast majority of attacks were by Carcharodon carcharias (Great White Shark).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Spearfishing and other seafood collection, as well as diving near fishing activities and/or seals, were identified as major risk factors. However, shark attacks on divers are relatively rare and represent only 3% of diving-related fatalities in Australia over this 57-year period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517954/,2022-11-28 02:53:48 AM
Immersion pulmonary edema: case reports from Oceania,"Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock, Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock",2019,"Introduction:
        
      
      We aimed to document identified cases of immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) in divers from Oceania (the Indo-Pacific region) from January 2002 to May 2018, inclusive.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Cases were identified using various sources, including searches of the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) Fatality Database, published case reports, and interviews with survivors who had reported their incident to DAN AP. Where available, investigations, pathology and autopsy results were obtained. Only incidents diagnosed as IPE by diving physicians or pathologists with experience in the investigation of diving accidents were included. Individual case histories and outcomes, together with brief individual summaries of the associations and possible contributing factors were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one IPE incidents in divers from Oceania were documented. There were two surface snorkelers, 22 scuba air divers and seven nitrox divers which included three closed-circuit rebreathers (CCR). The mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years, 58% of victims were females, and the average dive profile was to a maximum depth of 19 meters of seawater for 25 minutes. Six victims (19%) had previous episodes of IPE. There were nine recorded fatalities. Cardiac anomalies dominated the associated or possible contributing factors. These included valvular disease in 29%, transient cardiomyopathies in 26% and dysrhythmias in 16%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Previously reported associations of IPE such as exertion, stress, cold exposure, negative inspiratory pressure, hypertension, overhydration, ascent or surfacing, tight wetsuit, aspiration and certain medications were identified. Cardiac conditions were frequent and included chronic disorders (valvular pathology, coronary artery disease) and transient disorders (dysrhythmias, transient myocardial dysfunction, takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy). It is likely that the chronic cardiac disorders may have contributed to the IPE, whereas the transient cases could be either sequelae, contributors or coincidental to the IPE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683356/,2022-11-28 02:53:49 AM
Predictors for the development of temporomandibular disorders in scuba divers,"F Lobbezoo, A J van Wijk, M C Klingler, E Ruiz Vicente, C J van Dijk, M A J Eijkman, F Lobbezoo, A J van Wijk, M C Klingler, E Ruiz Vicente, C J van Dijk, M A J Eijkman",2014 Aug,"The aim was to determine predictors for the development of complaints of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in a large sample of Dutch scuba divers who were free of any TMD complaints before they started diving actively. Five-hundred and thirty-six scuba divers (mean ± SD age = 40.4 ± 11.9 years; 34.1% women) completed a specifically developed questionnaire, either online or on paper. Stepwise forward logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the presence of TMD pain, with several potential risk factors as predictors. Four hundred and eighty-five of the 536 respondents were free of any TMD pain before they started diving actively. In this sample, TMD pain was present in 214 persons (44.1%). Four predictors contributed significantly to the presence of TMD pain, viz., clenching (OR = 2.466), warm water (OR = 1.685), biting on the mouthpiece (OR = 1.598), and the quality rating of the mouthpiece (OR = 0.887, that is, a higher rating means a smaller odds of having TMD pain). TMD pain is a common complaint among scuba divers who were free of such complaints before they started diving actively. Clenching, biting on the mouthpiece, and a low rating of the mouthpiece are predictors for the presence of TMD pain in scuba divers, while diving in cold water serves as a protective factor for TMD pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24766672/,2022-11-28 02:53:49 AM
The use of portable 2D echocardiography and 'frame-based' bubble counting as a tool to evaluate diving decompression stress,"Peter Germonpré, Virginie Papadopoulou, Walter Hemelryck, Georges Obeid, Pierre Lafère, Robert J Eckersley, Meng-Xing Tang, Costantino Balestra, Peter Germonpré, Virginie Papadopoulou, Walter Hemelryck, Georges Obeid, Pierre Lafère, Robert J Eckersley, Meng-Xing Tang, Costantino Balestra",2014 Mar,"Introduction:
        
      
      'Decompression stress' is commonly evaluated by scoring circulating bubble numbers post dive using Doppler or cardiac echography. This information may be used to develop safer decompression algorithms, assuming that the lower the numbers of venous gas emboli (VGE) observed post dive, the lower the statistical risk of decompression sickness (DCS). Current echocardiographic evaluation of VGE, using the Eftedal and Brubakk method, has some disadvantages as it is less well suited for large-scale evaluation of recreational diving profiles. We propose and validate a new 'frame-based' VGE-counting method which offers a continuous scale of measurement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nine 'raters' of varying familiarity with echocardiography were asked to grade 20 echocardiograph recordings using both the Eftedal and Brubakk grading and the new 'frame-based' counting method. They were also asked to count the number of bubbles in 50 still-frame images, some of which were randomly repeated. A Wilcoxon Spearman ρ calculation was used to assess test-retest reliability of each rater for the repeated still frames. For the video images, weighted kappa statistics, with linear and quadratic weightings, were calculated to measure agreement between raters for the Eftedal and Brubakk method. Bland-Altman plots and intra-class correlation coefficients were used to measure agreement between raters for the frame-based counting method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Frame-based counting showed a better inter-rater agreement than the Eftedal and Brubakk grading, even with relatively inexperienced assessors, and has good intra- and inter-rater reliability.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Frame-based bubble counting could be used to evaluate post-dive decompression stress, and offers possibilities for computer-automated algorithms to allow near-real-time counting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24687479/,2022-11-28 02:53:50 AM
Defining risk variables causing gas embolism in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) caught in trawls and gillnets,"Andreas Fahlman, Jose Luis Crespo-Picazo, Blair Sterba-Boatwright, Brian A Stacy, Daniel Garcia-Parraga, Andreas Fahlman, Jose Luis Crespo-Picazo, Blair Sterba-Boatwright, Brian A Stacy, Daniel Garcia-Parraga",2017 Jun 1,"Incidental capture, or 'bycatch' in fishing gear is a major global threat to sea turtle populations. A recent study showed that underwater entrapment in fishing gear followed by rapid decompression may cause gas bubble formation within the blood stream (embolism) and tissues leading to organ injury, impairment, and even mortality in some bycaught individuals. We analyzed data from 128 capture events using logistic and ordinal regression to examine risk factors associated with gas embolism in sea turtles captured in trawls and gillnets. Likelihood of fatal decompression increases with increasing depth of gear deployment. A direct relationship was found between depth, risk and severity of embolism, which has not been previously demonstrated in any breath-hold diving species. For the trawl fishery in this study, an average trawl depth of 65 m was estimated to result in 50% mortality in by-caught turtles throughout the year. This finding is critical for a more accurate estimation of sea turtle mortality rates resulting from different fisheries and for devising efforts to avoid or minimize the harmful effects of capture.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28572687/,2022-11-28 02:53:51 AM

Rapid surfacing after diving causes alveolar rupture and bubbles release, which enter in the systemic circulation and could embolize numerous organs and tissues. The presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) contributes to the passage of venous gas bubbles into the arterial circulation, increasing the risk of complications related to DCI. The diagnosis is established with a detailed medical history, a comprehensive clinical evaluation, and a multimodal imaging approach. Although the percutaneous closure of PFO is ambiguous for divers, as a primary prevention strategy, transcatheter management is considered as beneficial for DCI recurrence prevention. The aim of this study is to introduce the basic principles of DCI, to review the pathophysiological connection between DCI and PFO, to highlight the risk factors and the optimal treatment, and, last but not least, to shed light on the role of closure as primary and secondary prevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35837370/,2022-11-28 02:53:52 AM
A longitudinal investigation of sports-related risk factors for disordered eating in aesthetic sports,"E M Krentz, P Warschburger, E M Krentz, P Warschburger",2013 Jun,"Previous studies have indicated a higher risk of disordered eating in certain types of elite sports such as aesthetic sports (e.g., rhythmical gymnastics, figure skating). But even though some studies on risk factors for disordered eating in sports exist, most research on this topic is based on cross-sectional data with limitations on causal inferences. We examined sports-related risk factors for disordered eating in a 1-year longitudinal study with two assessment points. The participants were 65 adolescent athletes from aesthetic sports (mean age 14.0 ±.2.2 years) who completed measures of disordered eating, social pressure from the sports environment, sports-related body dissatisfaction, desire to be leaner to improve sports performance, and emotional distress resulting from missed exercise sessions. All variables were relatively stable in the mean. Individual changes in the desire to be leaner to improve sports performance were associated with individual changes in disordered eating. Furthermore, a cross-lagged partial correlation analysis showed that the desire to be leaner to improve sports performance was predictive of disordered eating and not vice versa. The results of our study indicate that athletes are more at risk for disordered eating if they believe it is possible to enhance their sports performance through weight regulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22093018/,2022-11-28 02:53:52 AM
Physiology of repeated mixed gas 100-m wreck dives using a closed-circuit rebreather: a field bubble study,"Costantino Balestra, François Guerrero, Sigrid Theunissen, Peter Germonpré, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, François Guerrero, Sigrid Theunissen, Peter Germonpré, Pierre Lafère",2022 Feb,"Purpose:
        
      
      Data regarding decompression stress after deep closed-circuit rebreather (CCR) dives are scarce. This study aimed to monitor technical divers during a wreck diving expedition and provide an insight in venous gas emboli (VGE) dynamics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Diving practices of ten technical divers were observed. They performed a series of three consecutive daily dives around 100 m. VGE counts were measured 30 and 60 min after surfacing by both cardiac echography and subclavian Doppler graded according to categorical scores (Eftedal-Brubakk and Spencer scale, respectively) that were converted to simplified bubble grading system (BGS) for the purpose of analysis. Total body weight and fluids shift using bioimpedancemetry were also collected pre- and post-dive.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Depth-time profiles of the 30 recorded man-dives were 97.3 ± 26.4 msw [range: 54-136] with a runtime of 160 ± 65 min [range: 59-270]. No clinical decompression sickness (DCS) was detected. The echographic frame-based bubble count par cardiac cycle was 14 ± 13 at 30 min and 13 ± 13 at 60 min. There is no statistical difference neither between dives, nor between time of measurements (P = 0.07). However, regardless of the level of conservatism used, a high incidence of high-grade VGE was detected. Doppler recordings with the O'dive were highly correlated with echographic recordings (Spearman r of 0.81, P = 0.008).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although preliminary, the present observation related to real CCR deep dives questions the precedence of decompression algorithm over individual risk factors and pleads for an individual approach of decompression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34839432/,2022-11-28 02:53:53 AM
Efficacy of the U.S. Navy Treatment Tables in treating DCS in 103 recreational scuba divers,"Walter Chin, Ellie Joo, Scott Ninokawa, Daniel A Popa, Derek B Covington, Walter Chin, Ellie Joo, Scott Ninokawa, Daniel A Popa, Derek B Covington",2017 Sept-Oct,"Despite the fact that current decompression schedules reduce the risk of decompression sickness (DCS), recreational scuba divers continue to experience DCS. Therapy outcomes in these divers are difficult to track. Our study aims to understand the efficacy of the United States Navy (USN) Treatment Tables (5, 6, 6A, 9) in providing symptomatic relief among recreational scuba divers. We conducted a single-center retrospective review of recreational divers treated from 2003 to 2013. A total of 187 divers were identified: 84 divers were excluded, and the charts of the remaining 103 divers were independently reviewed by three clinicians. For these 103 divers, the response variable, therapy outcome, was categorized as no relief, partial relief, or complete relief of symptoms. In a population of 76 males and 27 females with an average of three dives and three treatments, 53 patients achieved complete symptomatic relief, 45 patients had partial relief, and five patients reported no relief at the end of all recompression treatments. Among the patients who achieved complete symptomatic relief, 28 (53%) needed only one recompression treatment. The depth of the diver's first dive and the change in symptoms within the first 20 minutes of the first recompression treatment were found to be explanatory variables of the treatment outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29116694/,2022-11-28 02:53:54 AM
Competing with injuries: injuries prior to and during the 15th FINA World Championships 2013 (aquatics),"Margo Mountjoy, Astrid Junge, Sarah Benjamen, Kevin Boyd, Mohamed Diop, David Gerrard, Cees-Rein van den Hoogenband, Saul Marks, Enrique Martinez-Ruiz, Jim Miller, Kyriakos Nanousis, Farhad Moradi Shahpar, Jose Veloso, William van Mechelen, Evert Verhagen, Margo Mountjoy, Astrid Junge, Sarah Benjamen, Kevin Boyd, Mohamed Diop, David Gerrard, Cees-Rein van den Hoogenband, Saul Marks, Enrique Martinez-Ruiz, Jim Miller, Kyriakos Nanousis, Farhad Moradi Shahpar, Jose Veloso, William van Mechelen, Evert Verhagen",2015 Jan,"Background:
        
      
      Injury and illness surveillance is the foundation for the development of prevention strategies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To examine injuries among the aquatic disciplines in the 4 weeks prior to and during the 2013 FINA World Championships.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was comprised of two components: (1) a retrospective athlete survey recording injuries in the 4 weeks prior to the Championships and (2) a prospective recording of injuries and illnesses by the medical teams of the participating countries and the local host medical team.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One-third of the 1116 responding athletes reported an injury/physical complaint in the 4 weeks prior to the Championships. Significantly more women (36.7%) than men (28.6%) reported injuries. Divers reported the highest rate of injury/physical complaints (55.7%). At the start of the Championships, 70% of injured respondents (n=258) were still symptomatic; however, full participation was expected by 76%. During the Championships, 186 new injuries were reported (8.3/100 registered athletes) with the highest injury incidence rate in water polo (15.3/100 registered athletes). The most common injured body part was the shoulder (21%). A total of 199 illnesses were reported during the Championships (9.0/100 registered athletes) with the most common diagnosis of illness being gastrointestinal infection. Environmental exposure (allergy, otitis and jellyfish stings) was responsible for 27% of all illnesses in open water swimming.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Injuries pose a significant health risk for elite aquatic athletes. A prospective study would improve understanding of out-of-competition injuries. Future injury and illness surveillance at FINA World Championships is required to direct and measure the impact of prevention strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25326096/,2022-11-28 02:53:55 AM
School density affects the strength of collective avoidance responses in wild-caught Atlantic herring Clupea harengus: a simulated predator encounter experiment,"G Rieucau, A De Robertis, K M Boswell, N O Handegard, G Rieucau, A De Robertis, K M Boswell, N O Handegard",2014 Nov,"An experimental study in a semi-controlled environment was conducted to examine whether school density in wild-caught Atlantic herring Clupea harengus affects the strength of their collective escape behaviours. Using acoustics, the anti-predator diving responses of C. harengus in two schools that differed in density were quantified by exposing them to a simulated threat. Due to logistical restrictions, the first fish was tested in a low-density school condition (four trials; packing density = 1.5 fish m(-3); c. 6000 fish) followed by fish in a high-density school condition (five trials; packing density = 16 fish m(-3); c. 60 000 fish). The C. harengus in a high-density school exhibited stronger collective diving avoidance responses to the simulated predators than fish in the lower-density school. The findings suggest that the density (and thus the internal organization) of a fish school affects the strength of collective anti-predatory responses, and the extent to which information about predation risk is transferred through the C. harengus school. Therefore, the results challenge the common notion that information transfer within animal groups may not depend on group size and density.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25243659/,2022-11-28 02:53:55 AM
Identifying and acting on inappropriate metadata: a critique of the Grattan Institute Report on questionable care in Australian hospitals,"P David Cooper, David R Smart, P David Cooper, David R Smart",2017 Mar,"Introduction:
        
      
      In an era of ever-increasing medical costs, the identification and prohibition of ineffective medical therapies is of considerable economic interest to healthcare funding bodies. Likewise, the avoidance of interventions with an unduly elevated clinical risk/benefit ratio would be similarly advantageous for patients. Regrettably, the identification of such therapies has proven problematic. A recent paper from the Grattan Institute in Australia (identifying five hospital procedures as having the potential for disinvestment on these grounds) serves as a timely illustration of the difficulties inherent in non-clinicians attempting to accurately recognize such interventions using non-clinical, indirect or poorly validated datasets.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To evaluate the Grattan Institute report and associated publications, and determine the validity of their assertions regarding hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) utilisation in Australia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Critical analysis of the HBOT metadata included in the Grattan Institute study was undertaken and compared against other publicly available Australian Government and independent data sources. The consistency, accuracy and reproducibility of data definitions and terminology across the various publications were appraised and the authors' methodology was reviewed. Reference sources were examined for relevance and temporal eligibility.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Review of the Grattan publications demonstrated multiple problems, including (but not limited to): confusing patient-treatments with total patient numbers; incorrect identification of 'appropriate' vs. 'inappropriate' indications for HBOT; reliance upon a compromised primary dataset; lack of appropriate clinical input, muddled methodology and use of inapplicable references. These errors resulted in a more than seventy-fold over-estimation of the number of patients potentially treated inappropriately with HBOT in Australia that year.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Numerous methodological flaws and factual errors have been identified in this Grattan Institute study. Its conclusions are not valid and a formal retraction is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28357824/,2022-11-28 02:53:56 AM
Ecological drivers of marine debris ingestion in Procellariiform Seabirds,"Lauren Roman, Elizabeth Bell, Chris Wilcox, Britta Denise Hardesty, Mark Hindell, Lauren Roman, Elizabeth Bell, Chris Wilcox, Britta Denise Hardesty, Mark Hindell",2019 Jan 29,"Procellariiform seabirds are both the most threatened bird group globally, and the group with the highest incidence of marine debris ingestion. We examined the incidence and ecological factors associated with marine debris ingestion in Procellariiformes by examining seabirds collected at a global seabird hotspot, the Australasian - Southern Ocean boundary. We examined marine debris ingestion trends in 1734 individuals of 51 Procellariform species, finding significant variation in the incidence of marine debris abundance among species. Variation in the incidence of marine debris ingestion between species was influenced by the taxonomy, foraging ecology, diet, and foraging range overlaps with oceanic regions polluted with marine debris. Among the ecological drivers of marine debris ingestion variability in Procellariiformes, we demonstrate that the combination of taxonomy, foraging method, diet, and exposure to marine debris are the most important determinants of incidence of ingestion. We use these results to develop a global forecast for Procellariiform taxa at the risk of highest incidence of marine debris ingestion. We find seabirds that forage at the surface; especially by surface seizing, diving and filtering, those with a crustacean dominant diet, and those that forage in or near marine debris hotspots are at highest risk of debris ingestion. We predict that family with the highest risk are the storm petrels (Hydrobatidae and Oceanitidae). We demonstrate that the greater the exposure of high-risk groups to marine debris while foraging, the greater the incidence and number of marine debris items will be ingested.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30696878/,2022-11-28 02:53:57 AM
Growth of a gas bubble in a perfused tissue in an unsteady pressure field with source or sink,"K G Mohamed, S A Mohammadein, K G Mohamed, S A Mohammadein",2019 Sep,"In the context of decompression sickness, this paper presents analytical formulae and explanations for growth of a gas bubble in blood and other tissues in an unsteady diffusion field with a source or a sink. The formulae are valid for variable (through decompression) and constant (concerning diving stops/at sea level) ambient pressure. Under a linear decompression regime for ambient pressure, the gas bubble growth is proportional to ascent rate, tissue diffusivity and initial tissue tension and inversely proportional to surface tension, initial ambient pressure and the strength of the source/sink parameter [Formula: see text] which gives the conditions for bubble growth. We find that the growth process is noticeably affected by changing k-values within a specified range, with no significant effect on the value of the bubble radius when k is outside this range. We discuss the effect of the presence of multiple bubbles, and of repetitive diving. Of the three available models for bubble growth, the predicted time to completion is longest in the model by Srinivasan et al. (J Appl Physiol 86:732-741, 1999), where the bubble grows in a steady diffusion field, but shortest in the model we describe for k-values closest to the boundaries of the interval [Formula: see text]. This is because our model considers the effect of the presence of a source, increasing the bubble growth rate and not taken into account in our previous (2010) model predicting an intermediate timeframe for bubble growth. We believe our new model provides a more accurate and widely applicable description of bubble growth in decompression sickness than previous versions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31289882/,2022-11-28 02:53:57 AM

We report a case of a 66-year-old man on maintenance dialysis who developed acute dyspnea and blood-tinged sputum after scuba diving. Vital signs on admission were significant for elevated blood pressure at 209/63 mmHg and hypoxia with an oxygen requirement of 6 L/min. Physical examination was remarkable for bilateral coarse crackles and systolic ejection murmur. Chest radiography revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. Echocardiography showed aortic stenosis and diffuse hypokinesis of left ventricular wall motion. We started bilevel positive airway pressure and administered nitroglycerin and nicardipine to maintain adequate oxygenation and reduce blood pressure. We started hemodialysis and extracorporeal ultrafiltration to remove excess fluid. His dyspnea subsided and oxygen was no longer required on Day 3. His long-standing hypertension, increased afterload due to vasoconstriction induced by cold water, increased capillary pressure due to impaired left ventricular motion and increased preload caused by exertion, and aortic stenosis probably contributed to pulmonary congestion. We propose maintenance dialysis as a novel risk factor for IPE due to its tendency to induce volume overload, increase pulmonary capillary pressure, and increase aortic stenosis risk. Patients on hemodialysis should refrain from diving to prevent this life-threatening condition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32168388/,2022-11-28 02:53:58 AM
A survey of jellyfish sting knowledge among Thai divers in Thailand,"Sukati Suriyan, Kanlaya Haruethaikan, Roopngam Evelyn Piyachat, Sukati Suriyan, Kanlaya Haruethaikan, Roopngam Evelyn Piyachat",2019,"Background:
        
      
      In tropical regions, jellyfish envenomation is a persistent hazard for people who spend time in the sea. Jellyfish stings can be dangerous, and among the people who face the greatest risk are scuba divers. This study therefore sought to determine the level of knowledge divers in Thailand have about the threat of jellyfish envenomation.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In April 2018, a total of 238 divers responded to a questionnaire, thereby providing data for further statistical analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The findings revealed that 31.91% of the study participants cited jellyfish stings as their most frequently encountered injury, with 68.09% having personal experience of the problem, or having seen others injured by jellyfish. However, 34.03% of the sample respondents believed their own level of knowledge to be ""low"" or ""none"". The mean score was 71%, which can be considered satisfactory, but the scores for items concerning the recognition of signs of envenomation and items about first aid responses (52.74% and 59.13%, respectively) were not acceptable.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Divers frequently experience jellyfish stings, and diving personnel were highly rated for their knowledge in this area. However, very few were fully confident in their first aid capabilities, and therefore it can be argued that it is necessary to improve the level of medical education and to provide training to eliminate this weakness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30931512/,2022-11-28 02:53:59 AM
Factors influencing the severity of long-term sequelae in fishermen-divers with neurological decompression sickness,"Jean-Eric Blatteau, Kate Lambrechts, Jean Ruffez, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Kate Lambrechts, Jean Ruffez",2020 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Numerous studies have been conducted to identify the factors influencing the short-term prognosis for neurological decompression sickness (DCS). However, the long-term sequelae are rarely assessed. The purpose of this study to investigate the factors likely to influence the long-term prognosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-seven Vietnamese fishermen-divers who on average 9 (SD 6) years beforehand had presented with neurological DCS and ongoing sequelae, were questioned and examined. The severity of the initial clinical profile was quantified using a severity score. The long-term sequelae were clinically evaluated by looking for a motor or sensory deficit or muscular spasticity, and by applying a severity score for the sequelae which focussed on gait and sphincter disorders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An initial severity score of ≥ 15 is significantly associated with a risk of serious long-term sequelae [OR = 13.7 (95% CI 2.4 to 79.5)]. Furthermore, certain treatment practices such as in-water recompression to depths > 17 metres' seawater breathing air are significantly associated with more serious sequelae. The practice of intensive non-standardised hyperbaric oxygen sessions over prolonged durations (median 30 days [IQR 19.5]) delayed after the initial accident (median 4 days [IQR 6]) also seems unfavourable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study establishes a link between the initial DCS severity and the long-term sequelae causing severe gait disorders and sphincter incontinence. Furthermore, this work suggests that certain detrimental treatment practices should be modified. During this field study, we also found that it was possible to reduce sequelae of these divers by offering them an individual programme of self-rehabilitation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32187612/,2022-11-28 02:54:00 AM
A Software Tool for the Annotation of Embolic Events in Echo Doppler Audio Signals,"Paola Pierleoni, Lorenzo Maurizi, Lorenzo Palma, Alberto Belli, Simone Valenti, Alessandro Marroni, Paola Pierleoni, Lorenzo Maurizi, Lorenzo Palma, Alberto Belli, Simone Valenti, Alessandro Marroni",2017 Dec 7,"The use of precordial Doppler monitoring to prevent decompression sickness (DS) is well known by the scientific community as an important instrument for early diagnosis of DS. However, the timely and correct diagnosis of DS without assistance from diving medical specialists is unreliable. Thus, a common protocol for the manual annotation of echo Doppler signals and a tool for their automated recording and annotation are necessary. We have implemented original software for efficient bubble appearance annotation and proposed a unified annotation protocol. The tool auto-sets the response time of human ""bubble examiners,"" performs playback of the Doppler file by rendering it independent of the specific audio player, and enables the annotation of individual bubbles or multiple bubbles known as ""showers."" The tool provides a report with an optimized data structure and estimates the embolic risk level according to the Extended Spencer Scale.

Use of Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) to detect sub-clinical inner ear damage in divers of the Indian Navy,"Dilip Raghavan, Shazia Khan, Dilip Raghavan, Shazia Khan",2014 Oct,"Background:
        
      
      Professional Divers are at a high risk of Sensorineural Hearing Impairment. Divers may sustain sub-clinical hearing loss that is not identified on pure tone audiometry (PTA). Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) reflect the functional status of the Outer Hair Cells. OAE testing constitutes the only non-invasive means of objective cochlear investigation and may be a more sensitive measure than PTA in identifying sub-clinical hearing loss.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This cross-sectional study was performed to determine utility of Otoacoustic Emissions testing in detecting sub-clinical Inner Ear damage in divers of Indian Navy. Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) levels were measured in 50 audiologically asymptomatic ship divers of Indian Navy and compared with control group comprising of 50 normal hearing individuals.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No statistically significant differences were observed between the study and control group. Also no correlation was observed between diving years and TEOAE levels. There was no correlation greater than -0.49 between diving years and TEOAE SNR.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We concluded that TEOAE levels are not a sensitive tool in identifying ships divers without any history of noise exposure at risk for developing hearing loss.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25382908/,2022-11-28 02:54:01 AM
Group foraging in Socotra cormorants: A biologging approach to the study of a complex behavior,"Timothée R Cook, Rob Gubiani, Peter G Ryan, Sabir B Muzaffar, Timothée R Cook, Rob Gubiani, Peter G Ryan, Sabir B Muzaffar",2017 Feb 26,"Group foraging contradicts classic ecological theory because intraspecific competition normally increases with aggregation. Hence, there should be evolutionary benefits to group foraging. The study of group foraging in the field remains challenging however, because of the large number of individuals involved and the remoteness of the interactions to the observer. Biologging represents a cost-effective solution to these methodological issues. By deploying GPS and temperature-depth loggers on individuals over a period of several consecutive days, we investigated intraspecific foraging interactions in the Socotra cormorant Phalacrocorax nigrogularis, a threatened colonial seabird endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. In particular, we examined how closely birds from the same colony associated with each other spatially when they were at sea at the same time and the distance between foraging dives at different periods of the day. Results show that the position of different birds overlapped substantially, all birds targeting the same general foraging grounds throughout the day, likely following the same school of fish. There were as many as 44,500 birds within the foraging flock at sea at any time (50% of the colony), and flocking density was high, with distance between birds ranging from 8 to 1,380 m. Birds adopted a diving strategy maximizing time spent underwater relative to surface time, resulting in up to 72% of birds underwater in potential contact with prey at all times while foraging. Our data suggest that the benefits of group foraging outweigh the costs of intense aggregation in this seabird. Prey detection and information transmission are facilitated in large groups. Once discovered, shoaling prey are concentrated under the effect of the multitude. Fish school cohesiveness is then disorganized by continuous attacks of diving birds to facilitate prey capture. Decreasing population size could pose a risk to the persistence of threatened seabirds where group size is important for foraging success.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28405270/,2022-11-28 02:54:02 AM
Transgenerational exposure to warming reduces the sensitivity to a pesticide under warming,"Shandong Meng, Tam T Tran, Vienna Delnat, Robby Stoks, Shandong Meng, Tam T Tran, Vienna Delnat, Robby Stoks",2021 Sep 1,"Despite the increased attention for temporal aspects of stressor interactions and for effects of warming in ecotoxicological studies, we lack knowledge on how different exposure durations to warming may affect pesticide sensitivity. We tested how three types of exposure duration to 4 °C warming (acute, developmental and transgenerational exposure to 24 °C vs 20 °C) shape the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on two ecologically relevant fitness-related traits of mosquito larvae: heat tolerance and antipredator behaviour. Transgenerational (from the parental generation) and developmental (from the egg stage) warming appeared energetically more stressful than acute warming (from the final instar), because (i) only the latter resulted in an adaptive increase of heat tolerance, and (ii) especially developmental and transgenerational warming reduced the diving responsiveness and diving time. Exposure to chlorpyrifos decreased the heat tolerance, diving responsiveness and diving time. The impact of chlorpyrifos was lower at 24 °C than at 20 °C indicating that the expected increase in toxicity at 24 °C was overruled by the observed increase in pesticide degradation. Notably, although our results suggest that transgenerational warming was energetically more stressful, it did reduce the chlorpyrifos-induced negative effects at 24 °C on heat tolerance and the alarm escape response compared to acute warming. Our results provide important evidence that the exposure duration to warming may determine the impact of a pesticide under warming, thereby identifying a novel temporal aspect of stressor interactions in risk assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33915393/,2022-11-28 02:54:03 AM

Cervical Spine Injuries in the Athlete,"Gregory D Schroeder, Alexander R Vaccaro, Gregory D Schroeder, Alexander R Vaccaro",2016 Sep,"Cervical spine injuries are extremely common and range from relatively minor injuries, such as cervical muscle strains, to severe, life-threatening cervical fractures with spinal cord injuries. Although cervical spine injuries are most common in athletes who participate in contact and collision sports, such as American football and rugby, they also have been reported in athletes who participate in noncontact sports, such as baseball, gymnastics, and diving. Cervical spine injuries in athletes are not necessarily the result of substantial spine trauma; some athletes have chronic conditions, such as congenital stenosis, that increase their risk for a serious cervical spine injury after even minor trauma. Therefore, physicians who cover athletic events must have a thorough knowledge of cervical spine injures and the most appropriate ways in which they should be managed. Although cervical spine injuries can be career-ending injuries, athletes often are able to return to play after appropriate treatment if the potential for substantial re-injury is minimized.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27479833/,2022-11-28 02:54:04 AM
Symptoms of central nervous system oxygen toxicity during 100% oxygen breathing at normobaric pressure with increasing inspired levels of carbon dioxide: a case report,"Mirit Eynan, Yehuda Arieli, Boris Taran, Yoav Yanir, Mirit Eynan, Yehuda Arieli, Boris Taran, Yoav Yanir",2020 Mar 31,"The greatest danger faced by divers who use oxygen-enriched gas mixtures is central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT). CNS-OT is characterised by convulsions resembling grand-mal epileptic seizures, which may terminate in drowning and death. Elevated arterial levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) (hypercapnia) represent a major risk factor for CNS-OT when breathing hyperoxic gas mixtures. To reduce the risk of a diver being involved in a CNS-OT incident due to hypercapnia, candidates for combat diving are examined at our institute using a routine physiological training procedure, in which they are tested for CO₂ detection and retention. We present the case of a candidate for combat diving, who unexpectedly exhibited signs typical of CNS-OT while breathing pure oxygen under normobaric conditions with > 3 kPa inspired CO₂. Severe headache and nausea, as well as facial muscle twitching, appeared during one of these routine tests. Subsequent medical examination including neurological tests, magnetic resonance imaging and an electroencephalogram were unremarkable.

Pregnancy outcome in partners of male professional divers in Norway,"Å Irgens, M Grønning, L M Irgens, Å Irgens, M Grønning, L M Irgens",2016 Nov 1,"Background:
        
      
      Diving is associated with both acute and long-term effects in several organ systems. Reduced semen quality after extreme diving and a reduced proportion of males in the offspring of divers have previously been reported.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To study pregnancy outcomes in partners of professional male divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The cohort of divers registered with the Norwegian Inshore Diving Registry was linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 6186 male divers had 10395 children registered in the MBRN during the study period. Of these, 52% were boys, compared to 51% in the general population. The partners of a subgroup of divers who were most likely to be occupationally exposed at the time of conception reported that early miscarriage was more frequent (27%) than in the general population (21%; relative risk 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.39). Otherwise, there was a lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, stillbirth, low birthweight, small for gestational age and low Apgar score compared to the general population.

Many fatalities involve tree-roosting bats, but reasons for this higher susceptibility remain unknown. To better understand behaviors associated with risk, we monitored bats at three experimentally manipulated wind turbines in Indiana, United States, from July 29 to October 1, 2012, using thermal cameras and other methods. We observed bats on 993 occasions and saw many behaviors, including close approaches, flight loops and dives, hovering, and chases. Most bats altered course toward turbines during observation. Based on these new observations, we tested the hypotheses that wind speed and blade rotation speed influenced the way that bats interacted with turbines. We found that bats were detected more frequently at lower wind speeds and typically approached turbines on the leeward (downwind) side. The proportion of leeward approaches increased with wind speed when blades were prevented from turning, yet decreased when blades could turn. Bats were observed more frequently at turbines on moonlit nights. Taken together, these observations suggest that bats may orient toward turbines by sensing air currents and using vision, and that air turbulence caused by fast-moving blades creates conditions that are less attractive to bats passing in close proximity. Tree bats may respond to streams of air flowing downwind from trees at night while searching for roosts, conspecifics, and nocturnal insect prey that could accumulate in such flows. Fatalities of tree bats at turbines may be the consequence of behaviors that evolved to provide selective advantages when elicited by tall trees, but are now maladaptive when elicited by wind turbines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25267628/,2022-11-28 02:54:07 AM
Health and wellbeing of recently active United States scuba divers,"Peter Buzzacott, Charles Edelson, James Chimiak, Frauke Tillmans, Peter Buzzacott, Charles Edelson, James Chimiak, Frauke Tillmans",2022 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study aimed to describe recently active adult scuba divers in the United States (US) and compare their characteristics with other active adults. The research question was: do active scuba divers have different health and wellbeing characteristics, compared with adults active in other pursuits?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a proportionally representative annual survey of adults in the US. It is the largest continuous population health survey in the world. Since 2011, data on scuba diving is collected biannually. A comparison group were matched on age, sex, being physically active and state of residence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The dataset comprised 103,686,087 person-years of monthly behavioural data, including 14,360 person years of monthly scuba data. The median weekly frequency of recent scuba diving was 1.0 times per week and the median weekly duration was equivalent to two dives each of one hour. Compared with the comparison group, divers more often earned > USD$50,000 per year, were less frequently married, with fewer children in the house, which they more often owned. They reported being able to afford a doctor if needed within the previous year, but more often reported excellent/good health and excellent/good mental health, despite the divers being 16% more frequently overweight.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results demonstrate a relatively healthy cohort of active scuba divers, confirming previous survey results that active divers are commonly college-educated, unmarried, without children, home owning, often overweight, they often currently drink alcohol, and smoked tobacco in the past, but commonly gave up smoking ten years or more ago.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313368/,2022-11-28 02:54:08 AM
Effects of freediving on middle ear and eustachian tube function,"Moritz F Meyer, Kristijana Knezic, Stefanie Jansen, Heinz D Klünter, Eberhard D Pracht, Maria Grosheva, Moritz F Meyer, Kristijana Knezic, Stefanie Jansen, Heinz D Klünter, Eberhard D Pracht, Maria Grosheva",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      During descent in freediving there is exposure to rapidly increasing pressure. Inability to quickly equalise middle ear pressure may cause trauma to the ear. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of pressure-related damage to the middle ear and the Eustachian tube during freediving and to identify possible risk factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixteen free divers performed diving sessions in an indoor pool 20 metres' freshwater (mfw) deep. During each session, each diver performed four own free dives and up to four safety dives. Naso- and oto-endoscopy and Eustachian tube function tests were performed on the right and left ears before diving, between each session and after the last session. The otoscopic findings were classified according to the Teed classification (0 = normal tympanic membrane to 4 = perforation). Additionally, ENT-related complaints were assessed using a questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants performed 317 dives (on average 20 dives per diver, six per session). The average depth was 13.3 mfw. Pressure-related changes (Teed 1 and 2) were detected in 48 % of ears. Teed level increased significantly with an increasing number of completed sessions (P < 0.0001). Higher pressure-related damage (Teed 2) occurred in less experienced divers, was associated with significantly lower peak pressures in the middle ear and led to more ear-related symptoms. A preference for the Frenzel technique for middle ear pressure equalisation during freediving was shown.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pressure exposure during freediving had a cumulative effect on the middle ear.

Regular medication use by active scuba divers with a declared comorbid medical condition and victims of scuba and snorkelling-related fatalities,"Simone E Taylor, David M Taylor, Daisy Pisasale, Kyle Booth, John Lippmann, Simone E Taylor, David M Taylor, Daisy Pisasale, Kyle Booth, John Lippmann",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to describe the nature of regular medications taken by active comorbid scuba divers (having a declared medical comorbidity) and scuba divers and snorkellers who died following a diving incident.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We undertook a retrospective, observational study from July to October, 2020. Data on 268 active comorbid divers were obtained through a 2013 survey of Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific members. Data on 126 deceased scuba divers and 175 deceased snorkellers were obtained predominantly from 2001-2013 reports to Australian State Coronial Services.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The active comorbid divers were significantly older, less likely to be male, and more likely to be taking one or more medications than the two deceased subject groups (P < 0.001). Cardiovascular, endocrine and psychotropic medications accounted for 53.4%, 9.9% and 6.4% of all medications taken, respectively. Almost one tenth of the deceased divers took at least one psychotropic medication, a proportion significantly greater than the other groups (P = 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medication use among active comorbid divers is common which likely reflects their declared medical condition. Nevertheless, they appear to be diving relatively safely, often with conditions once thought to be absolute contradictions to scuba diving. The deceased divers took significantly more psychotropic medications. It is possible that their underlying psychological/psychiatric conditions rendered them more at risk of a diving incident. Increased vigilance for psychological conditions may need to be considered during diving medical examinations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547777/,2022-11-28 02:54:10 AM

Critical factors for the prevention of low back pain in elite junior divers,"Takaya Narita, Koji Kaneoka, Masahiro Takemura, Yoshihiro Sakata, Takamichi Nomura, Shumpei Miyakawa, Takaya Narita, Koji Kaneoka, Masahiro Takemura, Yoshihiro Sakata, Takamichi Nomura, Shumpei Miyakawa",2014 Jun,"Background/aim:
        
      
      During competitive diving, divers jump up from 1 to 3 m springboards or 5 to 10 m platforms and dive into the water. The impact forces are very large in the water entry phase, and, as such, microtraumatic injuries are common due to the tremendous physical stress placed on the diver. Low-back pain (LBP) is the most frequently reported symptom in divers. This study aimed to extract possible risk factors related to LBP from physical and technical characteristics in Japanese elite junior divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eighty-three elite junior divers (42 men and 41 women) in Japan were included in this study. LBP was assessed by a questionnaire, interview and physical examination during a national training camp. Morphological data, physical fitness and diving skills were also evaluated. The factors related to LBP were extracted by using logistic-regression analysis and the forward-selection method (likelihood ratio).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 37.3% (31 reports) of back pain occurred in the lumbar region. Shoulder flexibility (OR 0.919; 95% CI 0.851 to 0.992) and age (OR 0.441; 95% CI 0.239 to 0.814) were recognised as factors related to LBP in male-elite junior divers, whereas only age (OR 0.536; 95% CI 0.335 to 0.856) was a factor in female-elite junior divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that shoulder flexibility is important for preventing LBP in elite-male junior divers, since they require full shoulder flexion during the water entry phase. Limited shoulder flexibility could cause lumbar hyperextension when adjusting for the angle of water entry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23620474/,2022-11-28 02:54:11 AM
The Extended Oxygen Window Concept for Programming Saturation Decompressions Using Air and Nitrox,"Jacek Kot, Zdzislaw Sicko, Tadeusz Doboszynski, Jacek Kot, Zdzislaw Sicko, Tadeusz Doboszynski",2015 Jun 25,"Saturation decompression is a physiological process of transition from one steady state, full saturation with inert gas at pressure, to another one: standard conditions at surface. It is defined by the borderline condition for time spent at a particular depth (pressure) and inert gas in the breathing mixture (nitrogen, helium). It is a delicate and long lasting process during which single milliliters of inert gas are eliminated every minute, and any disturbance can lead to the creation of gas bubbles leading to decompression sickness (DCS). Most operational procedures rely on experimentally found parameters describing a continuous slow decompression rate. In Poland, the system for programming of continuous decompression after saturation with compressed air and nitrox has been developed as based on the concept of the Extended Oxygen Window (EOW). EOW mainly depends on the physiology of the metabolic oxygen window--also called inherent unsaturation or partial pressure vacancy--but also on metabolism of carbon dioxide, the existence of water vapor, as well as tissue tension. Initially, ambient pressure can be reduced at a higher rate allowing the elimination of inert gas from faster compartments using the EOW concept, and maximum outflow of nitrogen. Then, keeping a driving force for long decompression not exceeding the EOW allows optimal elimination of nitrogen from the limiting compartment with half-time of 360 min. The model has been theoretically verified through its application for estimation of risk of decompression sickness in published systems of air and nitrox saturation decompressions, where DCS cases were observed. Clear dose-reaction relation exists, and this confirms that any supersaturation over the EOW creates a risk for DCS. Using the concept of the EOW, 76 man-decompressions were conducted after air and nitrox saturations in depth range between 18 and 45 meters with no single case of DCS. In summary, the EOW concept describes physiology of decompression after saturation with nitrogen-based breathing mixtures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26111113/,2022-11-28 02:54:12 AM
Theoretical tissue compartment inert gas pressures during a deep dive with and without deep decompression stops: a case analysis,"Peter Buzzacott, Virginie Papadopoulou, Adrian Baddeley, Nadan M Petri, Folke Lind, Peter Buzzacott, Virginie Papadopoulou, Adrian Baddeley, Nadan M Petri, Folke Lind",2015,"Background:
        
      
      Deep decompression stops are increasingly common in recreational technical diving. Concerns exist that they shift decompression stress back into slower tissues. A diver recorded an exceptional exposure dive, with deeps stops, on a commercially available dive computer.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Using the R package SCUBA tissue inert gas pressures in 17 Bühlmann (ZH-L16A) compartments were estimated from the dive computer recorded profile. The RGBM dive plan generated by the diver's software was similarly interrogated, as was a third profile with reduced deep stops generated using the VPM-B/E model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this dive the combination of 5 gas switches appeared to ameliorate the effect of deep stops from 76 m depth.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A higher-than-anticipated inert gas content in a decompression mixture, coupled with climbing 200 stairs post-decompression, appear possible risk factors for decompression sickness. Nonetheless, the physiological effect of deep decompression stops during exceptional exposure, even when diving with gas switches, remains urgently to be determined to improve safe decompression following exceptional exposures. Until algorithms utilising deep decompression stops are validated with human data, dive profiles incorporating deep decompression stops should be considered experimental.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25792166/,2022-11-28 02:54:13 AM
Pulse oximeter to detect peripheral oxygen saturation in underwater rebreather ECCR diver: a preliminary study,"Fabio Di Pumpo, Giovanni Ruffino, Paolo Malacarne, Fabio Di Pumpo, Giovanni Ruffino, Paolo Malacarne",2019 Jan-Feb,"Hypoxia is one of the main problems an underwater diver may have to face. The probability of experiencing hypoxia is related to the type of dive and the equipment used. Hypoxia in diving is a potentially fatal event for the diver, as it can lead to the loss of brain functions and consequently to the loss of breathing control, all in the absence of specific premonitory symptoms. It is a risk that may be encountered more frequently by divers who use a closed-circuit rebreather (CCR). For those who use this type of equipment, hypoxia is usually the most frequent cause of death [1]. Our study was aimed at the detection of peripheral oxygen saturation in order to identify, in the future, a preclinical hypoxic condition. We combined the use of pulse oximetry with two forehead sensors on an underwater diver subject who was using an electronic closed-circuit rebreather (ECCR). Despite the known limits of this method and the preliminary status of these findings [2], the recorded data show a clear validity in the use of pulse oximetry in immersion for the detection of peripheral oxygen saturation. In the future, the pulse oximeter could become part of the instrumentation of the diver who uses CCR gear. The device could easily be implemented in these rebreathers. The possibility of being able to perform a basic instrumental analysis means that the diver can become more quickly aware of imminent hypoxia, characterized by the absence of clearly identifiable warning symptoms, and can put in place all the correct procedures for an emergency ascent, avoiding serious consequences.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31154680/,2022-11-28 02:54:14 AM
Cerebellar infarction presenting as inner ear decompression sickness following scuba diving: a case report,"E Gempp, P Louge, B Soulier, P Alla, E Gempp, P Louge, B Soulier, P Alla",2014 Nov,"Introduction:
        
      
      Inner ear decompression sickness following scuba diving is not uncommon and the characteristic features of this disorder are acute peripheral vestibular syndrome, sometimes associated with cochlear signs, requiring urgent hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Cerebellar infarction can also mimic isolated peripheral vestibulopathy.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      The authors report the case of a 47-year-old man in good general health admitted with acute left vestibular dysfunction suggestive of inner ear decompression sickness 6 hours after scuba diving. Normal videonystagmography and delayed onset of occipital headache finally led to brain MRI that confirmed the presence of recent ischaemic infarction in the territory of the medial branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Complementary investigations revealed the presence of a patent foramen ovale with atrial septal aneurysm. No underlying atherosclerotic disease or clotting abnormalities were observed.
    


          Discussion/conclusion:
        
      
      Cerebellar infarction can present clinically with features of inner ear decompression sickness following scuba diving. An underlying air embolism mechanism cannot be excluded, particularly in patients with a large right-to-left circulatory shunt and no other cardiovascular risk factors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24954030/,2022-11-28 02:54:16 AM
"Variability in venous gas emboli following the same dive at 3,658 meters","Hayden W Hess, Courtney E Wheelock, Erika St James, Jocelyn L Stooks, Brian M Clemency, David Hostler, Hayden W Hess, Courtney E Wheelock, Erika St James, Jocelyn L Stooks, Brian M Clemency, David Hostler",2021 Fourth Quarter,"Exposure to a reduction in ambient pressure such as in high-altitude climbing, flying in aircrafts, and decompression from underwater diving results in circulating vascular gas bubbles (i.e., venous gas emboli [VGE]). Incidence and severity of VGE, in part, can objectively quantify decompression stress and risk of decompression sickness (DCS) which is typically mitigated by adherence to decompression schedules. However, dives conducted at altitude challenge recommendations for decompression schedules which are limited to exposures of 10,000 feet in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual (Rev. 7). Therefore, in an ancillary analysis within a larger study, we assessed the evolution of VGE for two hours post-dive using echocardiography following simulated altitude dives at 12,000 feet. Ten divers completed two dives to 66 fsw (equivalent to 110 fsw at sea level by the Cross correction method) for 30 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber. All dives were completed following a 60-minute exposure at 12,000 feet. Following the dive, the chamber was decompressed back to altitude for two hours. Echocardiograph measurements were performed every 20 minutes post-dive. Bubbles were counted and graded using the Germonpré and Eftedal and Brubakk method, respectively. No diver presented with symptoms of DCS following the dive or two hours post-dive at altitude. Despite inter- and intra-diver variability of VGE grade following the dives, the majority (11/20 dives) presented a peak VGE Grade 0, three VGE Grade 1, one VGE Grade 2, four VGE Grade 3, and one VGE Grade 4. Using the Cross correction method for a 66-fsw dive at 12,000 feet of altitude resulted in a relatively low decompression stress and no cases of DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34847312/,2022-11-28 02:54:17 AM
Thirty-five Day Fluoxetine Treatment Limits Sensory-Motor Deficit and Biochemical Disorders in a Rat Model of Decompression Sickness,"Caroline Cosnard, Sébastien De Maistre, Jacques H Abraini, Laurent Chazalviel, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Jean-Jacques Risso, Nicolas Vallée, Caroline Cosnard, Sébastien De Maistre, Jacques H Abraini, Laurent Chazalviel, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Jean-Jacques Risso, Nicolas Vallée",2017 Sep 5,"According to the OECD statistical base for 2014, anti-depressants will, on average, be distributed at a rate of 62 daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants for the 25 countries surveyed (Health at a glance: Europe 2014; OECD Health Statistics; World Health Organization and OECD Health Statistics, 2014). Divers must be concerned. On another hand, divers are potentially exposed to decompression sickness including coagulation inflammation and ischemia, which can result in neurological lesions or even death. The purpose of this study is to assess whether chronic treatment with anti-depressants may represent a contraindication to the practice of an at-risk activity, such as, scuba diving, or even presents a benefit by attenuating the severity of the symptoms. We study for the first time the effect of a 35-day fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/kg) on the occurrence of decompression sickness in laboratory rats (n = 79). Following exposure to the hazardous protocol, there is a significant correlation between the type of treatment and the clinical status of the rats in favor of a better clinical prognosis for the rats treated with fluoxetine with a significantly higher number of No DCS status and a lower number of Severe DCS status in the Flux, compared to Controls. The treatment modifies the rat performances both significantly and favorably during the physical and behavioral tests, just like their biological and biochemical constants. After decompression, rats under treatment display lower sensory-motor deficit and lowers biochemical disorders.

International travelers and unintentional fatal drowning in Australia--a 10 year review 2002-12,"Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat, Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat",2016 Feb 15,"Introduction:
        
      
      . Drowning deaths of travelers are commonly reported in the media, creating a perception that they are at a higher risk of drowning than residents. This may be true, due in part to unfamiliarity with the risks posed by the hazard, however there is limited information about drowning deaths of travelers in Australia. This study aims to identify the incidence of drowning among international travelers in Australia and examine the risk factors to inform prevention strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      . Data on unintentional fatal drowning in Australian waterways of victims with a residential postcode from outside Australia were extracted from the Royal Life Saving Society-Australia National Fatal Drowning Database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      . Between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2012 drowning deaths among people known to be international travelers accounted for 4.3% (N = 123) of the 2870 drowning deaths reported in Australian waterways. Key locations for drowning deaths included beaches (39.0%), ocean/harbour (22.0%) and swimming pools (12.2%). Leading activities prior to drowning included swimming (52.0%), diving (17.9%) and watercraft incidents (13.0%).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      . International travelers pose a unique challenge from a drowning prevention perspective. The ability to exchange information on water safety is complicated due to potential language barriers, possible differences in swimming ability, different attitudes to safety in the traveler's home country and culture, a lack of opportunities to discuss safety, a relaxed attitude to safety which may result in an increase in risk taking behaviour and alcohol consumption.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      . Prevention is vital both to reduce loss of life in the aquatic environment and promote Australia as a safe and enjoyable holiday destination for international travelers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26883927/,2022-11-28 02:54:18 AM
Individual-level behavioral responses of immature green turtles to snorkeler disturbance,"Lucas P Griffin, Jacob W Brownscombe, Tyler O Gagné, Alexander D M Wilson, Steven J Cooke, Andy J Danylchuk, Lucas P Griffin, Jacob W Brownscombe, Tyler O Gagné, Alexander D M Wilson, Steven J Cooke, Andy J Danylchuk",2017 Mar,"Despite many positive benefits of ecotourism, increased human encounters with wildlife may have detrimental effects on wild animals. As charismatic megafauna, nesting and foraging sea turtles are increasingly the focus of ecotourism activities. The purpose of our study was to quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at distances of ≤3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified two distinct turtle personality types, 'bold' and 'timid', based upon 145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further, turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of turtles.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28039527/,2022-11-28 02:54:18 AM
Deciphering function of the pulmonary arterial sphincters in loggerhead sea turtles ( Caretta caretta),"Daniel García-Párraga, Teresa Lorenzo, Tobias Wang, Jose-Luis Ortiz, Joaquín Ortega, Jose-Luis Crespo-Picazo, Julio Cortijo, Andreas Fahlman, Daniel García-Párraga, Teresa Lorenzo, Tobias Wang, Jose-Luis Ortiz, Joaquín Ortega, Jose-Luis Crespo-Picazo, Julio Cortijo, Andreas Fahlman",2018 Dec 4,"To provide new insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying gas emboli (GE) in bycaught loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), we investigated the vasoactive characteristics of the pulmonary and systemic arteries, and the lung parenchyma (LP). Tissues were opportunistically excised from recently dead animals for in vitro studies of vasoactive responses to four different neurotransmitters: acetylcholine (ACh; parasympathetic), serotonin (5HT), adrenaline (Adr; sympathetic) and histamine. The significant amount of smooth muscle in the LP contracted in response to ACh, Adr and histamine. The intrapulmonary and systemic arteries contracted under both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and when exposed to 5HT. However, proximal extrapulmonary arterial (PEPA) sections contracted in response to ACh and 5HT, whereas Adr caused relaxation. In sea turtles, the relaxation in the pulmonary artery was particularly pronounced at the level of the pulmonary artery sphincter (PASp), where the vessel wall was highly muscular. For comparison, we also studied tissue response in freshwater sliders turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans). Both PEPA and LP from freshwater sliders contracted in response to 5HT, ACh and also Adr. We propose that in sea turtles, the dive response (parasympathetic tone) constricts the PEPA, LP and PASp, causing a pulmonary shunt and limiting gas uptake at depth, which reduces the risk of GE during long and deep dives. Elevated sympathetic tone caused by forced submersion during entanglement with fishing gear increases the pulmonary blood flow causing an increase in N2 uptake, potentially leading to the formation of blood and tissue GE at the surface. These findings provide potential physiological and anatomical explanations on how these animals have evolved a cardiac shunt pattern that regulates gas exchange during deep and prolonged diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30348649/,2022-11-28 02:54:19 AM
Temporary and permanent unfitness of occupational divers. Brest Cohort 2002-2019 from the French National Network for Occupational Disease Vigilance and Prevention (RNV3P),"Richard Pougnet, Laurence Pougnet, Jean-Dominique Dewitte, Brice Loddé, David Lucas, Richard Pougnet, Laurence Pougnet, Jean-Dominique Dewitte, Brice Loddé, David Lucas",2020,"Background:
        
      
      In France, the monitoring of professional divers is regulated. Several learned societies (French Occupational Medicine Society, French Hyperbaric Medicine Society and French Maritime Medicine Society) have issued follow-up recommendations for professional divers, including medical follow-up. Medical decisions could be temporary unfitness for diving, temporary fitness with monitoring, a restriction of fitness, or permanent unfitness. The aim of study was to point out the causes of unfitness in our centre.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The divers' files were selected from the French National Network for Occupational Disease Vigilance and Prevention (RNV3P). Only files with a special medical decision were selected, between 2002 and 2019.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three hundred and ninety-six professional divers are followed-up in our centre and 1371 medical decisions were delivered. There were 29 (7.3%) divers with a special medical decision, during 42 (3.1%) medical visit. Twelve (3.0%) had a permanent unfitness. The leading cause of unfitness was pulmonary diseases: emphysema (3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (2), asthma (2). Sixteen (4.0%) divers had temporary unfitness. The leading causes were cardiovascular (4 times) and neurological (6 times). Twelve (3.0%) divers had had at least one decompression sickness.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Judgments of permanent unfitness for diving were rare (3.0% of divers), but were because of life-threatening disease.

Delayed hyperbaric oxygen therapy for severe arterial gas embolism following scuba diving: a case report,"Charlotte Sadler, Emi Latham, Melanie Hollidge, Benjamin Boni, Kaighley Brett, Charlotte Sadler, Emi Latham, Melanie Hollidge, Benjamin Boni, Kaighley Brett",2019,"We present the case of a 42-year-old female who was critically ill due to an arterial gas embolism (AGE) she experienced while diving in Maui, Hawaii. She presented with shortness of breath and dizziness shortly after surfacing from a scuba dive and then rapidly lost consciousness. The diver then had a complicated hospital course: persistent hypoxemia (likely secondary to aspiration) requiring intubation; markedly elevated creatine kinase; atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion; and slow neurologic improvement. She had encountered significant delay in treatment due to lack of availability of local hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy. Our case illustrates many of the complications that can occur when a patient suffers a severe AGE. These cases may occur even without a history of rapid ascent or risk factors for pulmonary barotrauma, and it is imperative that they be recognized and treated as quickly as possible with HBO2. Unfortunately, our case also highlights the challenges in treating critically ill divers, particularly with the growing shortage of 24/7 hyperbaric chambers able to treat these ICU-level patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051065/,2022-11-28 02:54:21 AM
"Decompression models: review, relevance and validation capabilities","J Hugon, J Hugon",2014 Nov-Dec,"Introduction/background:
        
      
      For more than a century, several types of mathematical models have been proposed to describe tissue desaturation mechanisms in order to limit decompression sickness. These models are statistically assessed by DCS cases, and, over time, have gradually included bubble formation biophysics. This paper proposes to review this evolution and discuss its limitations.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This review is organized around the comparison of decompression model biophysical criteria and theoretical foundations. Then, the DCS-predictive capability was analyzed to assess whether it could be improved by combining different approaches.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most of the operational decompression models have a neo-Haldanian form. Nevertheless, bubble modeling has been gaining popularity, and the circulating bubble amount has become a major output. By merging both views, it seems possible to build a relevant global decompression model that intends to simulate bubble production while predicting DCS risks for all types of exposures and decompression profiles.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A statistical approach combining both DCS and bubble detection databases has to be developed to calibrate a global decompression model. Doppler ultrasound and DCS data are essential: i. to make correlation and validation phases reliable; ii. to adjust biophysical criteria to fit at best the observed bubble kinetics; and iii. to build a relevant risk function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25562945/,2022-11-28 02:54:22 AM

      Factors contributing to the pathogenesis of decompression sickness (DCS) in divers have been described in many studies. However, relative importance of these factors has not been reported.

      In this case-control study, we compared the diving profiles of divers experiencing DCS with those of a control group. The DCS group comprised 35 recreational scuba divers who were diagnosed by physicians as having DCS. The control group consisted of 324 apparently healthy recreational divers. All divers conducted their dives from 2009 to 2011. The questionnaire consisted of 33 items about an individual's diving profile, physical condition and activities before, during and just after the dive. To simplify dive parameters, the dive site was limited to Izu Osezaki. Odds ratios and multiple logistic regression were used for the analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Odds ratios revealed several items as dive and health factors associated with DCS. The major items were as follows: shortness of breath after heavy exercise during the dive (OR = 12.12), dehydration (OR = 10.63), and maximum dive depth > 30 msw (OR = 7.18). Results of logistic regression were similar to those by odds ratio analysis.

We report a case of dental barotrauma and barodontalgia in a diving physician accompanying patients during hyperbaric oxygen treatment, and due to pressure changes in the hyperbaric chamber. The physician developed sharp pain localised to the right maxillary molars but radiating to the face, ear and head during decompression from 243 kPa (2.4 atmospheres absolute). The pain intensified following completion of decompression and was consistent with irreversible pulpitis. Clinical examination and panoramic radiography suggested fracture of a heavily restored tooth due to barotrauma. This was managed by tooth extraction. The physician subsequently discontinued accompanying the patients during their hyperbaric oxygen treatment sessions. Dentists and maxillofacial surgery specialists suggest waiting for a minimum of four weeks or until the tooth socket and/or oral tissue has healed sufficiently to minimise the risk of infection or further trauma before exposure to further pressure change.

Acoustic and visual stimuli combined promote stronger responses to aerial predation in fish,"Juliane Lukas, Pawel Romanczuk, Haider Klenz, Pascal Klamser, Lenin Arias Rodriguez, Jens Krause, David Bierbach, Juliane Lukas, Pawel Romanczuk, Haider Klenz, Pascal Klamser, Lenin Arias Rodriguez, Jens Krause, David Bierbach",2021 Jul 19,"Bird predation poses a strong selection pressure on fish. Since birds must enter the water to catch fish, a combination of visual and mechano-acoustic cues (multimodal) characterize an immediate attack, while single cues (unimodal) may represent less dangerous disturbances. We investigated whether fish could use this information to distinguish between non-threatening and dangerous events and adjust their antipredator response to the perceived level of risk. To do so, we investigated the antipredator behavior of the sulphur molly (Poecilia sulphuraria), a small freshwater fish which is almost exclusively preyed on by piscivorous birds in its endemic sulfide spring habitat. In a field survey, we confirmed that these fish frequently have to distinguish between disturbances stemming from attacking birds (multimodal) and those which pose no (immediate) threat such as bird overflights (unimodal). In a laboratory experiment, we then exposed fish to artificial visual and/or acoustic stimuli presented separately or combined. Sensitivity was high regardless of stimulus type and number (more than 96% of fish initiated diving), but fish dove deeper, faster, and for longer when both stimuli were available simultaneously. Based on the system's high rates of bird activity, we argue that such an unselective dive initiation with subsequent fine-tuning of diving parameters in accordance to cue modality represents an optimal strategy for these fish to save energy necessary to respond to future attacks. Ultimately, our study shows that fish anticipate the imminent risk posed by disturbances linked to bird predation through integrating information from both visual and acoustic cues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34949958/,2022-11-28 02:54:26 AM
Reliability of venous gas embolism detection in the subclavian area for decompression stress assessment following scuba diving,"Julien Hugon, Asya Metelkina, Axel Barbaud, Ron Nishi, Fethi Bouak, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Emmanuel Gempp, Julien Hugon, Asya Metelkina, Axel Barbaud, Ron Nishi, Fethi Bouak, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Emmanuel Gempp",2018 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Ultrasonic detection of venous gas emboli (VGE) in the precordial (PRE) region is commonly used in evaluation of decompression stress. While subclavian (SC) VGE detection can also be used to augment and improve the evaluation, no study has rigorously compared VGE grades from both sites as decompression stress indicators.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective study examined 1,016 man-dives breathing air extracted from the Defence Research and Development Canada dataset. Data for each man-dive included dive parameters (depth, bottom time, total ascent time), PRE and SC VGE grades (Kisman-Masurel) and post-dive decompression sickness (DCS) status. Correlation between SC and PRE grades was analyzed and the association of the probability of DCS (pDCS) with dive parameters and high bubble grades (HBG III- to IV) was modelled by logistic regression for SC and PRE separately for DCS risk ratio comparisons.
    


          Results:
        
      
      PRE and SC VGE grades were substantially correlated (R = 0.66) and were not statistically different (p = 0.61). For both sites, pDCS increased with increasing VGE grade. When adjusted for dive parameters, the DCS risk was significantly associated with HBG for both PRE (p = 0.03) and SC (p < 0.001) but the DCS risk ratio for SC HBG (RR = 6.0, 95% CI [2.7-12.3]) was significantly higher than for PRE HBG (RR = 2.6, 95% CI [1.1-6.0]).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The association of bubble grades with DCS occurrence is stronger for SC than PRE when exposure severity is taken into account.

Colonic Fermentation Promotes Decompression sickness in Rats,"Sébastien de Maistre, Nicolas Vallée, Emmanuel Gempp, Kate Lambrechts, Pierre Louge, Claude Duchamp, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Sébastien de Maistre, Nicolas Vallée, Emmanuel Gempp, Kate Lambrechts, Pierre Louge, Claude Duchamp, Jean-Eric Blatteau",2016 Feb 8,"Massive bubble formation after diving can lead to decompression sickness (DCS). During dives with hydrogen as a diluent for oxygen, decreasing the body's H2 burden by inoculating hydrogen-metabolizing microbes into the gut reduces the risk of DCS. So we set out to investigate if colonic fermentation leading to endogenous hydrogen production promotes DCS in fasting rats. Four hours before an experimental dive, 93 fasting rats were force-fed, half of them with mannitol and the other half with water. Exhaled hydrogen was measured before and after force-feeding. Following the hyperbaric exposure, we looked for signs of DCS. A higher incidence of DCS was found in rats force-fed with mannitol than in those force-fed with water (80%, [95%CI 56, 94] versus 40%, [95%CI 19, 64], p < 0.01). In rats force-fed with mannitol, metronidazole pretreatment reduced the incidence of DCS (33%, [95%CI 15, 57], p = 0.005) at the same time as it inhibited colonic fermentation (14 ± 35 ppm versus 118 ± 90 ppm, p = 0.0001). Pre-diveingestion of mannitol increased the incidence of DCS in fasting rats when colonic fermentation peaked during the decompression phase.

Coastal drowning comprises a significant proportion of the drowning burden in Australia and is influenced by a range of behavioural factors (e.g. risk perception, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours) that are poorly understood. These factors, along with those that impact exposure (e.g. coastal visitation and activity participation) all impact on drowning risk. While excellent mortality and morbidity data exists in Australia, a lack of coastal participation data presents challenges to identifying high-risk groups or activities and prioritising prevention efforts. This methods paper describes the development and evolution of an ongoing, annual, nationally representative online survey as an effective tool used to capture valuable data about the Australian population's relationship with the coast. This paper explores how the survey is structured (12-14 sections spanning multiple topics and themes), the different question types used (including open text, 4-digit responses and categorical questions), the sample size (1400-1600 respondents), sampling strategy (using demographic quota sampling which can then be post-weighted to the population if required) and how topics and themes have changed over time to enhance the quality of data collected (i.e., wording changes to enhance participant comprehension or data usability and changing issue-specific 'feature' topics of interest such as campaign evaluation). How the survey is implemented online is described, both practically through to third-party recruitment processes and ethically to maximise anonymity of respondents and ensure data quality. Interim analyses indicate the impact of considering exposure when calculating fatal drowning rates, especially by activity (e.g., crude boating drowning rate 0.12 per 100,000 population vs 0.95 per 100,000 exposed population [relative risk = 8.01; 95% confidence interval: 4.55-14.10]). This study highlights lessons learned in the process of conducting a nationally representative coastal participation survey as well as the strengths and limitations of adopting this approach. Data collected will provide more detailed information on the skills, behaviours, knowledge and attitudes of coastal activity participants. Analyses of this unique dataset will inform research that will underpin development and evaluation of coastal drowning prevention initiatives prioritising those most at risk. It is hoped that the methods detailed within this study may be useful for other countries to develop similar approaches to understanding their own population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34388222/,2022-11-28 02:54:29 AM

      Dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON) continues to be a significant occupational hazard that has significant medical and social consequences for professional divers. This review aims to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of DON among professional divers and to summarize the scientific knowledge regarding distribution of the lesions as well as disease prognosis and treatment.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A literature review using the Medline database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The prevalence of DON varies between 0 and 70.6% in professional divers, and its prevalence is highest in Turkey, Hawaii, Korea and Japan but is dependent on activity and medical monitoring. The risk of DON is very low for military divers who strictly obey the decompression rules and who undergo periodic medical examination. DON pre- dominately occurs in the proximal part of the femur and humerus. In a majority of cases, DON will progress despite the absence of further dysbaric exposure.

A retrospective study of oral pathoses in Israeli military divers and non-divers: 2011-2020,"Nir Tsur, Yael Arbel, Shlomi Abuhasira, Yael Permut, Alex Lvovsky, Noam Protter, Nir Tsur, Yael Arbel, Shlomi Abuhasira, Yael Permut, Alex Lvovsky, Noam Protter",2022 Feb,"Background/aim:
        
      
      Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving has grown tremendously as a recreational sport over the past decade. The pain divers experience due to barometric changes is referred to as barodontalgia, and it is known to cause various oral pathoses. Furthermore, divers suffer more frequently from temporomandibular disorders than non-divers. The aim of the study was to characterize oral pathoses between military divers and military non-divers.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Data from the dental files of healthy Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers aged 18-40 years were collected retrospectively for the years 2011-2020. The data for subjects exposed to diving were compared to commando and special forces soldiers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study population was composed of 6398 soldiers, which included 1036 divers and 5362 non-divers. All participants were male, with a median age of 22 years (mean = 22.1 years). Overall, higher rates of faulty dental restorations were seen among divers than non-divers (9.3% vs. 6.7% p = .006). Temporomandibular disorders were more prevalent among divers, specifically Disc Displacement Without Reduction (DDWOR) (0.4% vs. 0.1% p = .003). While dental fractures showed no significant difference between divers and non-divers (3.8% vs. 3.5% p = 0.8), other oral injuries were nine times more prevalent among divers versus non-divers.
    


          Conclusion:

Different effect of l-NAME treatment on susceptibility to decompression sickness in male and female rats,"Aleksandra Mazur, Peter Buzzacott, Kate Lambrechts, Qiong Wang, Marc Belhomme, Michael Theron, Georgi Popov, Giovanni Distefano, Francois Guerrero, Aleksandra Mazur, Peter Buzzacott, Kate Lambrechts, Qiong Wang, Marc Belhomme, Michael Theron, Georgi Popov, Giovanni Distefano, Francois Guerrero",2014 Nov,"Vascular bubble formation results from supersaturation during inadequate decompression contributes to endothelial injuries, which form the basis for the development of decompression sickness (DCS). Risk factors for DCS include increased age, weight-fat mass, decreased maximal oxygen uptake, chronic diseases, dehydration, and nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Production of NO is often affected by diving and its expression-activity varies between the genders. Little is known about the influence of sex on the risk of DCS. To study this relationship we used an animal model of Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) to induce decreased NO production. Male and female rats with diverse ages and weights were divided into 2 groups: treated with l-NAME (in tap water; 0.05 mg·mL(-1) for 7 days) and a control group. To control the distribution of nitrogen among tissues, 2 different compression-decompression protocols were used. Results showed that l-NAME was significantly associated with increased DCS in female rats (p = 0.039) only. Weight was significant for both sexes (p = 0.01). The protocol with the highest estimated tissue pressures in the slower compartments was 2.6 times more likely to produce DCS than the protocol with the highest estimated tissue pressures in faster compartments. The outcome of this study had significantly different susceptibility to DCS after l-NAME treatment between the sexes, while l-NAME per se had no effect on the likelihood of DCS. The analysis also showed that for the appearance of DCS, the most significant factors were type of protocol and weight.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25181356/,2022-11-28 02:54:31 AM
Humpback whale adult females and calves balance acoustic contact with vocal crypsis during periods of increased separation,"Katherine L Indeck, Michael J Noad, Rebecca A Dunlop, Katherine L Indeck, Michael J Noad, Rebecca A Dunlop",2022 Feb 9,"Acoustic communication is important for animals with dependent young, particularly when they are spatially separated. Maternal humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) use acoustic calling to help minimize the risk of separation from their young calves during migration. These pairs also use acoustic crypsis to minimize detection by males. How they balance a restricted active space with the need to maintain acoustic contact during periods of separation is not yet understood. Here, we analyzed movement metrics of tagged adult female-calf pairs during migration to identify two behavioral states, ""resting/milling"" and ""travelling."" When travelling, these pairs dived synchronously and exhibited little to no spatial separation. Alternatively, adult females had significantly longer dive durations (p < .01) when resting, and while they spent prolonged times at depth, calves would surface several times independently. This demonstrated that these pairs are frequently separated during periods of rest. We then determined whether the call rates and acoustic levels of these pairs increased with more frequent separation, finding that both adult females and calves significantly increased their call rates, but not levels, when resting. We also found that adult female-calf pairs have a restricted active space, with less than 15% of calls estimated to be detectable beyond 2 km. However, as with call level, detection distance did not differ significantly between the two behavioral states. In summary, adult female-calf pairs maintain successful communication during periods of separation by calling more frequently rather than by producing louder calls. This strategy aids in maintaining acoustic contact while simultaneously limiting detectability by conspecifics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35154661/,2022-11-28 02:54:32 AM

From 2007 to 2010, we used satellite telemetry to monitor the movements and dive behavior of nine adult and eleven subadult leatherbacks captured on the Northeast USA shelf and tracked throughout the Northwest Atlantic. Leatherback movements and environmental associations varied by oceanographic region, with slow, sinuous, area-restricted search behavior and shorter, shallower dives occurring in cool (median sea surface temperature: 18.4°C), productive (median chlorophyll a: 0.80 mg m(-3)), shallow (median bathymetry: 57 m) shelf habitat with strong sea surface temperature gradients (median SST gradient: 0.23°C km(-1)) at temperate latitudes. Leatherbacks were highly aggregated in temperate shelf and slope waters during summer, early fall, and late spring and more widely dispersed in subtropical and tropical oceanic and neritic habitat during late fall, winter and early spring. We investigated the relationship of ecoregion, satellite-derived surface chlorophyll, satellite-derived sea surface temperature, SST gradient, chlorophyll gradient and bathymetry with leatherback search behavior using generalized linear mixed-effects models. The most well supported model showed that differences in leatherback search behavior were best explained by ecoregion and regional differences in bathymetry and SST. Within the Northwest Atlantic Shelves region, leatherbacks increased path sinuosity (i.e., looping movements) with increasing SST, but this relationship reversed within the Gulf Stream region. Leatherbacks increased path sinuosity with decreasing water depth in temperate and tropical shelf habitats. This relationship is consistent with increasing epipelagic gelatinous zooplankton biomass with decreasing water depth, and bathymetry may be a key feature in identifying leatherback foraging habitat in neritic regions. High-use habitat for leatherbacks in our study occurred in coastal waters of the North American eastern seaboard and eastern Caribbean, putting turtles at heightened risk from land- and ocean-based human activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24646920/,2022-11-28 02:54:33 AM

During the 2020/21 season, 19 adult breeding yellow-eyed penguins from Port Pegasus, Paterson Inlet, and Codfish Island were fitted with GPS-TDR dive loggers to track their movements and diving behaviours. A total of 25,696 dives were recorded across 91 foraging trips. Birds from Port Pegasus reached significantly greater depths, spent longer at the seafloor, and performed longer dives. They also had the smallest foraging distribution, with most activity concentrated inshore. Compared to Port Pegasus, foraging radii and trip lengths were twice as large for Paterson Inlet and four times larger at Codfish Island. Despite differences in available foraging habitat, considerable individual and intra-site consistency for preferred foraging locations was observed. Localised behaviour and inter-site differences in dive metrics suggest significant plasticity in foraging ecology across their mainland range; however, individual behaviour and preferred foraging locations were extremely predictable.

Pre-hydration strongly reduces decompression sickness occurrence after a simulated dive in the rat,"Qiong Wang, François Guerrero, Michaël Theron, Qiong Wang, François Guerrero, Michaël Theron",2020 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hydration status is considered a parameter likely to influence the risk of decompression sickness (DCS), but scientific evidence is scarce and conflicting. This experiment aimed to analyse the influence of pre-hydration on DCS occurrence in a rat model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Intra-peritoneal injections of saline solution were administered to rats (NaCl 0.9% 0 ml (Control), 0.1 ml (Group 1), or 1 ml·100g-1 body mass (Group 2) at each of 24 h, 12 h, and 30 min prior to simulated air dives (45 min at 1,010 kPa; compression and decompression rates 101 kPa·min-1; stops 5 min at 202 kPa, 5 min at 160 kPa, 10 min at 130 kPa). Evaluation of DCS occurrence and severity was made after decompression.

Rorqual whale nasal plugs: protecting the respiratory tract against water entry and barotrauma,"Kelsey N Gil, Margo A Lillie, A Wayne Vogl, Robert E Shadwick, Kelsey N Gil, Margo A Lillie, A Wayne Vogl, Robert E Shadwick",2020 Feb 17,"The upper respiratory tract of rorquals, lunge-feeding baleen whales, must be protected against water incursion and the risk of barotrauma at depth, where air-filled spaces like the bony nasal cavities may experience high adverse pressure gradients. We hypothesize these two disparate tasks are accomplished by paired cylindrical nasal plugs that attach on the rostrum and deep inside the nasal cavity. Here, we present evidence that the large size and deep attachment of the plugs is a compromise, allowing them to block the nasal cavities to prevent water entry while also facilitating pressure equilibration between the nasal cavities and ambient hydrostatic pressure (Pamb) at depth. We investigated nasal plug behaviour using videos of rorquals surfacing, plug morphology from dissections, histology and MRI scans, and plug function by mathematically modelling nasal pressures at depth. We found each nasal plug has three structurally distinct regions: a muscular rostral region, a predominantly fatty mid-section and an elastic tendon that attaches the plug caudally. We propose muscle contraction while surfacing pulls the fatty sections rostrally, opening the nasal cavities to air, while the elastic tendons snap the plugs back into place, sealing the cavities after breathing. At depth, we propose Pamb pushes the fatty region deeper into the nasal cavities, decreasing air volume by about half and equilibrating nasal cavity to Pamb, preventing barotrauma. The nasal plugs are a unique innovation in rorquals, which demonstrate their importance and novelty during diving, where pressure becomes as important an issue as the danger of water entry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974219/,2022-11-28 02:54:36 AM

Psychotropic Drug Use in Recreational Scuba Divers and its Effect on Severe Narcosis,"Thierry Krummel, Alicia Thiery, Marion Villain, Bernard Schittly, Benoit Brouant, Thierry Krummel, Alicia Thiery, Marion Villain, Bernard Schittly, Benoit Brouant",2017 Apr,"Recreational scuba diving is no longer reserved for young healthy individuals, and as a result, medical drug consumption is on the rise in the diving population. Due to the possible potentiation of nitrogen narcosis by psychotropic drugs, the latter are hence discouraged and are subject to contraindications for practice. However, there are no available experimental data to support this theoretical assumption. The objective of this study is to investigate whether psychotropic drug users are more at risk of severe narcosis. An online survey was sent to the licensed divers from the East of France registered with the French Underwater Federation. Divers were surveyed regarding their consumption of psychotropic drugs, the occurrence of nitrogen narcosis as well as their respective diver's curriculum vitae.1 608 divers responded to the survey of which 15.2% confirmed having used psychotropic drugs and 7.8% since they became divers. Overall, 40.0% and 5.5% experienced severe and critical narcosis. In multivariate analysis, neither severe nor critical narcosis was associated with psychotropic drug use (OR 0.97 [0.59-1.57] and 0.76 [0.29-2.00], respectively).In conclusion, despite the recommendations, a significant proportion of divers use psychotropic drugs but do not seem to be more prone to severe narcosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28249344/,2022-11-28 02:54:39 AM
Static Metabolic Bubbles as Precursors of Vascular Gas Emboli During Divers' Decompression: A Hypothesis Explaining Bubbling Variability,"Jean-Pierre Imbert, Salih Murat Egi, Peter Germonpré, Costantino Balestra, Jean-Pierre Imbert, Salih Murat Egi, Peter Germonpré, Costantino Balestra",2019 Jul 11,"Introduction:
        
      
      The risk for decompression sickness (DCS) after hyperbaric exposures (such as SCUBA diving) has been linked to the presence and quantity of vascular gas emboli (VGE) after surfacing from the dive. These VGE can be semi-quantified by ultrasound Doppler and quantified via precordial echocardiography. However, for an identical dive, VGE monitoring of divers shows variations related to individual susceptibility, and, for a same diver, dive-to-dive variations which may be influenced by pre-dive pre-conditioning. These variations are not explained by currently used algorithms. In this paper, we present a new hypothesis: individual metabolic processes, through the oxygen window (OW) or Inherent Unsaturation of tissues, modulate the presence and volume of static metabolic bubbles (SMB) that in turn act as precursors of circulating VGE after a dive.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We derive a coherent system of assumptions to describe static gas bubbles, located on the vessel endothelium at hydrophobic sites, that would be activated during decompression and become the source of VGE. We first refer to the OW and show that it creates a local tissue unsaturation that can generate and stabilize static gas phases in the diver at the surface. We then use Non-extensive thermodynamics to derive an equilibrium equation that avoids any geometrical description. The final equation links the SMB volume directly to the metabolism.
    


          Results and discussion:
        
      
      Our model introduces a stable population of small gas pockets of an intermediate size between the nanobubbles nucleating on the active sites and the VGE detected in the venous blood. The resulting equation, when checked against our own previously published data and the relevant scientific literature, supports both individual variation and the induced differences observed in pre-conditioning experiments. It also explains the variability in VGE counts based on age, fitness, type and frequency of physical activities. Finally, it fits into the general scheme of the arterial bubble assumption for the description of the DCS risk.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Metabolism characterization of the pre-dive SMB population opens new possibilities for decompression algorithms by considering the diver's individual susceptibility and recent history (life style, exercise) to predict the level of VGE during and after decompression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31354506/,2022-11-28 02:54:40 AM

Transthoracic echocardiography was used to score VGE and AGE, and transcranial Doppler was used to visualize middle and posterior cerebral arteries with automated objective bubble detection. Observations were conducted for 45-min after dive at rest and at the laboratory after agitated saline injection at rest and throughout an incremental cycle supine exercise test until exhaustion and for 10 min of recovery.

      After resurfacing, all divers presented endogenous VGE and arterialization was present in three divers. Saline contrast injection led to AGE in nine of 19 subjects at rest. AGE that reached the cerebral arteries after dive were recorded in two divers at 60 W, three at 90 W, five at 120 W, six at 150 W, and four at 180 W and in three, four, five, nine, and nine, respectively, after saline contrast injection in the laboratory. All divers had AGE grades of 1 or 2, and only single AGE reached the cerebral vasculature.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These data suggest that few emboli of venous origin reach the brain through exercise-induced intrapulmonary arterial-venous anastomoses but cerebral embolization is not high risk in the studied population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25628180/,2022-11-28 02:54:41 AM
Diel differences in blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) dive behavior increase nighttime risk of ship strikes in northern Chilean Patagonia,"Francesco Caruso, Leigh Hickmott, Joseph D Warren, Paolo Segre, Gustavo Chiang, Paulina Bahamonde, Sonia Español-Jiménez, Songhai Li, Alessandro Bocconcelli, Francesco Caruso, Leigh Hickmott, Joseph D Warren, Paolo Segre, Gustavo Chiang, Paulina Bahamonde, Sonia Español-Jiménez, Songhai Li, Alessandro Bocconcelli",2021 Jul,"The northern Chilean Patagonia region is a key feeding ground and a nursing habitat in the southern hemisphere for blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus). From 2014 to 2019, during 6 separate research cruises, the dive behavior of 28 individual blue whales was investigated using bio-logging tags (DTAGs), generating ≈190 h of data. Whales dove to significantly greater depths during the day compared to nighttime (day: 32.6 ± 18.7 m; night: 6.2 ± 2.7 m; P < 0.01). During the night, most time was spent close to the surface (86% ± 9.4%; P < 0.01) and at depths of less than 12 m. From 2016 to 2019, active acoustics (scientific echosounders) were used to record prey (euphausiids) density and distribution simultaneously with whale diving data. Tagged whales appeared to perform dives relative to the vertical migration of prey during the day. The association between diurnal prey migration and shallow nighttime dive behavior suggests that blue whales are at increased risk of ship collisions during periods of darkness since the estimated maximum ship draft of vessels operating in the region is also ≈12 m. In recent decades, northern Chilean Patagonia has seen a large increase in marine traffic due to a boom in salmon aquaculture and the passenger ship industry. Vessel strike risks for large whales are likely underestimated in this region. Results reported in this study may be valuable for policy and mitigation decisions regarding conservation of the endangered blue whale.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166068/,2022-11-28 02:54:41 AM
A survey of caustic cocktail events in rebreather divers,"Peter Buzzacott, Grant Z Dong, Rhiannon J Brenner, Frauke Tillmans, Peter Buzzacott, Grant Z Dong, Rhiannon J Brenner, Frauke Tillmans",2022 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) are designed to be watertight. Ingressing water may react with carbon dioxide absorbent in the CCR, which may produce alkaline soda with a pH of 12-14, popularly referred to by CCR divers as a 'caustic cocktail'. This study aimed to explore divers' responses to caustic cocktail events and to investigate if CCR diving experience is associated with experiencing a caustic cocktail.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An online survey instrument was developed and an invitation to participate was extended to certified CCR divers aged ≥ 18 years. Relationships between number of caustic cocktail events and potential risk factors: age; hours of rebreather diving experience; and number of rebreather dives were explored.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 413 respondents, 394 (95%) identified as male, mean age was 46 years and median length of CCR certification was six years. Fifty-seven percent (n = 237) of respondents reported having experienced a caustic cocktail. The probability of self-reporting none, one, or more caustic cocktail events increased with experience. Divers reported a variety of first aid treatments for caustic cocktails, with ∼80% citing their CCR instructor as a source of information.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The more hours or dives a CCR diver accrues, the more likely they will self-report having experienced one or more caustic cocktail events. The majority of CCR divers responded to a caustic cocktail by rinsing the oral cavity with water. A proportion of divers, however, responded by ingesting soda, dairy, juice, or a mildly acidic solution such as a mixture of vinegar and water. The recommendation to immediately flush with water needs reinforcing among rebreather divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732280/,2022-11-28 02:54:42 AM

We report on a healthy military diver who developed PE following a wet chamber dive. A diagnosis of PE secondary to sinus barotrauma was reached. He was treated conservatively without medication and his symptoms recovered completely within 10 days. To the best of our knowledge, only five cases of diving-related PE have been reported in the literature. Analysis of these cases and ours revealed that facial trauma, repeated forceful Valsalva manoeuvres and recent upper respiratory tract infection are probable risk factors for diving-related PE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868601/,2022-11-28 02:54:43 AM
Analysis of recreational closed-circuit rebreather deaths 1998-2010,"Andrew W Fock, Andrew W Fock",2013 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Since the introduction of recreational closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) in 1998, there have been many recorded deaths. Rebreather deaths have been quoted to be as high as 1 in 100 users.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Rebreather fatalities between 1998 and 2010 were extracted from the Deeplife rebreather mortality database, and inaccuracies were corrected where known. Rebreather absolute numbers were derived from industry discussions and training agency statistics. Relative numbers and brands were extracted from the Rebreather World website database and a Dutch rebreather survey. Mortality was compared with data from other databases. A fault-tree analysis of rebreathers was compared to that of open-circuit scuba of various configurations. Finally, a risk analysis was applied to the mortality database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 181 recorded recreational rebreather deaths occurred at about 10 times the rate of deaths amongst open-circuit recreational scuba divers. No particular brand or type of rebreather was over-represented. Closed-circuit rebreathers have a 25-fold increased risk of component failure compared to a manifolded twin-cylinder open-circuit system. This risk can be offset by carrying a redundant 'bailout' system. Two-thirds of fatal dives were associated with a high-risk dive or high-risk behaviour. There are multiple points in the human-machine interface (HMI) during the use of rebreathers that can result in errors that may lead to a fatality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While rebreathers have an intrinsically higher risk of mechanical failure as a result of their complexity, this can be offset by good design incorporating redundancy and by carrying adequate 'bailout' or alternative gas sources for decompression in the event of a failure. Designs that minimize the chances of HMI errors and training that highlights this area may help to minimize fatalities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813461/,2022-11-28 02:54:43 AM
Case Report: A First Case of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Potentially Associated With Scuba Diving,"Thabo Mahendiran, Benoît Desgraz, Panagiotis Antiochos, Vladimir Rubimbura, Thabo Mahendiran, Benoît Desgraz, Panagiotis Antiochos, Vladimir Rubimbura",2022 Apr 14,"Background:
        
      
      Scuba diving has rarely been associated with spontaneous arterial dissection. However, all documented cases have involved the cervicocranial arteries.
    


          Case summary:
        
      
      We report the first case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) potentially associated with scuba diving in a 65-year-old female with no medical history or known cardiovascular risk factors. She presented with sudden-onset chest pain during her descent whilst scuba diving on holiday. An initial ECG revealed transient abnormalities, but due to normal initial blood tests, a reassuring echocardiogram, and the resolution of her symptoms, she was discharged from hospital without a clear diagnosis. During her subsequent presentation to our hospital 1 week later, electrocardiographic evidence of an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) was noted, with an echocardiogram revealing regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricular inferior wall. Coronary angiography revealed the presence of a SCAD of the posterior left ventricular artery, with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of an inferior MI. As recommended in the majority of cases of SCAD, this case was managed conservatively with a favorable clinical course.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the first reported case of SCAD potentially associated with scuba diving. It highlights the importance of considering SCAD in patients presenting with sudden-onset chest pain during physical activity, especially in female patients (including older patients) with no cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, it serves as a reminder that symptoms during scuba diving are not always related to decompression illness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35497983/,2022-11-28 02:54:44 AM
Patent Foramen Ovale Closure and Decompression Sickness Among Divers,"Omar M Abdelfattah, Ahmed Sayed, Islam Y Elgendy, Malak Munir, Yehia Saleh, Samir R Kapadia, George S Abela, Hani Jneid, Omar M Abdelfattah, Ahmed Sayed, Islam Y Elgendy, Malak Munir, Yehia Saleh, Samir R Kapadia, George S Abela, Hani Jneid",2022 Jul,"Background:
        
      
      Decompression sickness is a diving-related disease that results in various clinical manifestations, ranging from joint pain to severe pulmonary and CNS affection. Complications of this disease may sometimes persist even after treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In addition, it may hamper the quality of life by forcing divers to restrict their recreational practice. The presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) increases the risk of decompression sickness by facilitating air embolization. Therefore, PFO closure may play a role in reducing such complications. However, PFO closure remains associated with its own set of risks and complications. We sought to assess the benefit and harm of PFO closure for the prevention of decompression sickness in divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. Two-armed studies comparing the incidence of decompression sickness with or without PFO closure were included. We used a random-effects model to compute risk ratios comparing groups undergoing PFO closure to those not undergoing PFO closure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four observational studies with a total of 309 divers (PFO closure: 141 and no closure: 168) met inclusion criteria. PFO closure was associated with a significantly lower incidence of decompression sickness (PFO-closure: 2.84%; no closure: 11.3%; RR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.89; NNTB = 11), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). The mean follow-up was 6.12 years (Standard deviation 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 7.63% of PFO closures, including tachyarrhythmias and bleeding.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      PFO closure may potentially reduce the risk of decompression sickness among divers; however, it is not free of potential downsides, with nearly one in thirteen patients in our analysis experiencing an adverse event.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34810112/,2022-11-28 02:54:45 AM
Bayesian approach to decompression sickness model parameter estimation,"L E Howle, P W Weber, J M Nichols, L E Howle, P W Weber, J M Nichols",2017 Mar 1,"We examine both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches for estimating probabilistic decompression sickness model parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation treats parameters as fixed values and determines the best estimate through repeated trials, whereas the Bayesian approach treats parameters as random variables and determines the parameter probability distributions. We would ultimately like to know the probability that a parameter lies in a certain range rather than simply make statements about the repeatability of our estimator. Although both represent powerful methods of inference, for models with complex or multi-peaked likelihoods, maximum likelihood parameter estimates can prove more difficult to interpret than the estimates of the parameter distributions provided by the Bayesian approach. For models of decompression sickness, we show that while these two estimation methods are complementary, the credible intervals generated by the Bayesian approach are more naturally suited to quantifying uncertainty in the model parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28119191/,2022-11-28 02:54:45 AM
Health-related adverse events and associated factors in recreational divers with different certification levels,"Leyla Ozdemir, Güler Duru-Aşiret, Burcu Bayrak-Kahraman, Nilgün Devrez, Asutay Akbayir, Leyla Ozdemir, Güler Duru-Aşiret, Burcu Bayrak-Kahraman, Nilgün Devrez, Asutay Akbayir",2013 Sep-Oct,"Background:
        
      
      There is a paucity of research on diving-related health issues and associated factors. This study aimed to examine the health problems encountered during diving and to ascertain the factors associated with adverse events.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The sample of this descriptive study consisted of 132 recreational divers from diving schools in Ankara. The researchers collected the data using a questionnaire developed according to the relevant literature.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Diving-related health issues including barotraumas, nitrogen narcosis, and decompression sickness were mostly dependent on depth. The divers with higher certification levels witnessed diving-related adverse events more frequently and a significant increase in health problems with greater depth attained (p < 0.05). More experienced divers with longer duration of diving (p < 0.05) and greater number of dives reported more health problems associated with diving between 41 and 65 m. Adverse events did not differ according to diving-related educational features (p > 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The finding implies the importance of adherence to the depth limit of 40 m for recreational divers, being a slow ascend diver, and utilization of a buddy system in order to prevent diving-related adverse events. A data recording system related to diving and regulations particularly for tourist divers in the countries attracting tourists is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23992571/,2022-11-28 02:54:46 AM
Hyperoxic myopia: a case series of four divers,"Jonathan W Brügger, Glenn A Rauscher, John P Florian, Jonathan W Brügger, Glenn A Rauscher, John P Florian",2020 Second Quarter,"Hyperoxic myopia is a phenomenon reported in individuals who have prolonged exposure to an increased partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and subsequently have a myopic (nearsighted) change in their vision. To date, there are numerous accounts of hyperoxic myopia in dry hyperbaric oxygen treatment patients; however, there have been only three confirmed cases reported in wet divers. This case series adds four confirmed cases of hyperoxic myopia in wet divers using 1.35 atmospheres (ATM) PO2 at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU). The four divers involved were the first author's patients at NEDU. Conditions for two divers were confirmed via record review, whereas the other two divers were diagnosed by the first author. All subjects were interviewed to correlate subjective data with objective findings. Each subject completed five consecutive six-hour hyperoxic (PO2 of 1.35 ATM) dives with 18-hour surface intervals. Each individual was within the U. S. Navy Dive Manual's standards for general health. Visual acuity was measured prior to diving. Within three to four days after diving, the individuals reported blurry vision with an associated myopic refraction shift. Each diver had spontaneous resolution of his myopia over the next two to three weeks, with no significant residual symptoms. The divers in this case series were exposed to an increased PO2 (1.35 ATM for 30 hours over five days), a lesser exposure than that in other reports of hyperoxic myopia in wet divers diagnosed with hyperoxic myopia (1.3-1.6 ATM for 45-85 hours in 12-18 days). Furthermore, this pulse of exposure was more concentrated than typically seen with traditional hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperoxic myopia continues to be a risk for those conducting intensive diving with a PO2 between 1.3-1.6 ATM. Additional investigation is warranted to better define risk factors and PO2 limits regarding ocular oxygen toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32574443/,2022-11-28 02:54:47 AM

To the best of our knowledge, only six cases diagnosed as Brown-Séquard syndrome caused by DCS have been reported in the literature.

      To demonstrate the utility of 12-lead Holter monitoring underwater.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Holter monitor, recording a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) underwater, was applied to 16 pre-trained volunteer scuba divers (13 males and three females). Dive computers were synchronized with the Holter recorder to correlate the ECG tracings with diving events. Our main objective was to demonstrate the utility of recording over a period of time a good quality 12-lead ECG underwater. The ECGs were analyzed for heart rate (HR), arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities and ischaemic events in relation to various stages of diving as follows: baseline, pre diving, diving, and post diving.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ECG tracings were of good quality with minimal artefacts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a significant difference in HR during the various diving stages (P < 0.0001). Other recorded ECG abnormalities included supraventricular ectopic beats (four cases), ventricular ectopic beats (eight cases) and ventricular couplets (two cases). Conduction abnormalities included rate-dependent right and left bundle branch block; however, these findings were previously known in these divers. No evidence of ischaemia was seen.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Continuous 12-lead Holter monitoring underwater can produce good quality tracings.

While sharks were reported to normally ignore people, 9 operators had experienced troublesome behaviour from them. Whilst our research corroborates previous studies indicating minimal risk to humans from most shark encounters, a precautionary approach to provisioning is required to avoid potential ecological and societal effects of shark tourism.

Oxygen exposures at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab: a 20-year experience,"Shane C Walker, Alejandro Garbino, Kristi Ray, Renny Hardwick, Daniel T Fitzpatrick, Robert W Sanders, Shane C Walker, Alejandro Garbino, Kristi Ray, Renny Hardwick, Daniel T Fitzpatrick, Robert W Sanders",2018 Jul-Aug,"Astronauts training for extravehicular activity (EVA) operations can spend many hours submerged underwater in a pressurized suit, called an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU), exposed to pressures exceeding 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA). To minimize the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) a 46% nitrox mixture is used. This limits the nitrogen partial pressure, decreasing the risk of DCS. The trade-off with using a 46% nitrox mixture is the increased potential for oxygen toxicity, which can lead to severe neurologic symptoms including seizures. Suited runs, which typically expose astronauts of 0.9-1.1 ATA for longer than six hours, routinely exceed the recommendation for central nervous system oxygen toxicity limits (CNSOTL) published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Fortunately, in over 50,000 hours of suited training dives spanning 20 years of EVA training operations at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) there has never been an occurrence of oxygen toxicity. This lends support to anecdotal sentiment among certain members of the hyperbaric community that the NOAA CNSOTL recommendations might be overly conservative, at least for the oxygen pressure and time regime in which NBL operates. The NOAA CNSOTL recommendations are the result of expert consensus with a focus on safety and do not necessarily reflect rigorous experimental evidence. The data from the NBL suited dive operations provide a foundation of evidence that can help inform the expert discussion on dive-related neurologic oxygen toxicity performance and overnight recovery in young, healthy males.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30241122/,2022-11-28 02:54:51 AM
Reversible myocardial dysfunction and clinical outcome in scuba divers with immersion pulmonary edema,"Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, Anne Henckes, Sebastien Demaistre, Phillipe Heno, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, Anne Henckes, Sebastien Demaistre, Phillipe Heno, Jean-Eric Blatteau",2013 Jun 1,"Immersion pulmonary edema in scuba divers is a rare disorder that tends to recur and can be potentially fatal, even in the absence of underlying cardiac disease. Anecdotal cases of reversible myocardial dysfunction have been described in this setting, but little is known of its pathogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to determine the clinical outcomes and the determinants associated with this condition. The data from 54 consecutive divers admitted for acute immersion pulmonary edema during a 5.5-year period were retrospectively studied. A diagnosis of myocardial dysfunction was established by the presence of elevated cardiac troponin T levels, coupled with electrocardiographic changes and/or wall motion abnormalities on the echocardiogram. The demographic, clinical, biologic, and diving characteristics were tested as potential predictors of this disorder. All the patients had complete resolution of symptoms within 72 hours, but 3 required intensive ventilation or hemodynamic support at admission. Reversible myocardial dysfunction was observed in 28% and was associated more with age >50 years (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 21, p = 0.013), hypertension (OR 8.2, 95% CI 2.1 to 32, p = 0.002), diabetes (OR 22.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 458; p = 0.002), and release of natriuretic peptides (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.4 to 35, p = 0.001). Follow-up investigations at 1 month were obtained for 49 patients and revealed a significant number of patients with occult hypertension. In conclusion, reversible myocardial dysfunction is not uncommon in divers with immersion pulmonary edema.

Factors influencing adherence to pre-dive checklists among recreational scuba divers,"Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Charles Poole, Stephen W Marshall, Kristen L Kucera, Petar J Denoble, Steve Wing, Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Charles Poole, Stephen W Marshall, Kristen L Kucera, Petar J Denoble, Steve Wing",2016 Nov-Dec,"Pre-dive checklists can prevent mishaps, injuries, and deaths in recreational scuba diving. However, the prevalence of checklist use remains low. Understanding the environmental and individual factors influencing a diver's checklist use may help in promoting checklists. In the summer of 2012, 617 divers were enrolled in the intervention group of a cluster randomized trial. The divers received an intervention pre-dive checklist to use before they made dives. Logistic regression analyses were used to model adherence to pre-dive checklist with generalized estimating equations. About 70% divers (n=430) adhered to the intervention pre-dive checklist. Factors associated with greater adherence were the use of a diver's own written self-checklist - odds ratio (OR) = 2.48 (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 6.44), older age (⟩ 35 years) - OR = 1.67 (1.15, 2.42), and higher average annual dives (6-10 dives vs. 0-5 dives) - OR = 1.87 (1.09, 3.21).

Causes of death and preceding circumstances were examined by a medical examiner experienced in diving autopsies. Case notes were searched for witnessed seizures at elevated partial pressures of oxygen.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The dataset comprised 344 air divers (86%) and 55 divers breathing EAN (14%). EAN divers' fatal dives were deeper than air divers' (28 msw vs 18 msw, p < 0.0001). Despite this, of the 249 cases where a cause of death was established, only three EAN divers were considered to have possibly died following CNS oxygen toxicity seizures at depth (ppO2 132, 142 and 193 kPa).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The analysis of recreational diving fatalities in the US over 10 years found just one death likely from CNS oxygen toxicity among EAN divers. A further two possible, although unlikely, cases were also found. Fears of commonplace CNS oxygen toxicity seizures while EAN diving have not apparently been realized.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28128653/,2022-11-28 02:54:53 AM
First impressions: Use of the Azoth Systems O'Dive subclavian bubble monitor on a liveaboard dive vessel,"Peter Germonpré, Paul Van der Eecken, Elke Van Renterghem, Faye-Lisa Germonpré, Costantino Balestra, Peter Germonpré, Paul Van der Eecken, Elke Van Renterghem, Faye-Lisa Germonpré, Costantino Balestra",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      The Azoth Systems O'Dive bubble monitor is marketed at recreational and professional divers as a tool to improve personal diving decompression safety. We report the use of this tool during a 12-day dive trip aboard a liveaboard vessel.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six divers were consistently monitored according to the user manual of the O'Dive system. Data were synchronised with the Azoth server whenever possible (depending on cell phone data signal). Information regarding ease of use, diver acceptance and influence on dive behaviour were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 157 dives were completely monitored over 11 diving days. Formal evaluations were only available after six days because of internet connection problems. Sixty-one dives resulted in the detection of bubbles, mostly in one diver, none of which produced any symptoms of decompression illness.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The O'Dive system may contribute to increasing dive safety by making divers immediately aware of the potential consequences of certain types of diving behaviour. It was noted that bubble monitoring either reinforced divers in their safe diving habits or incited them to modify their dive planning. Whether this is a lasting effect is not known.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325023/,2022-11-28 02:54:54 AM
On diver thermal status and susceptibility to decompression sickness,"Wayne A Gerth, Wayne A Gerth",2015 Sep,"In a recent Letter to the Editor, Clarke, et al, indicated that divers who deliberately chill themselves on a dive to reduce risk of decompression sickness (DCS) may be misinterpreting our 2007 Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) report. Indeed, we did not advocate that divers should risk hypothermia on bottom to reduce risk of DCS, nor do we dispute the authors' overall admonition to avoid diving cold unnecessarily. However, Clarke, et al, imply more generally that results of our study are not applicable to recreational or technical divers because the dives we tested were atypical of dives undertaken by such divers. We wish to clarify that our study does have implications for recreational and technical divers, implications that should not be ignored. The dives we tested were not intended to be typical of dives undertaken in any actual operational context. Instead, we chose to expose divers to temperatures at the extremes of their thermal tolerance in order to ensure that effects of diver thermal status on DCS susceptibility would be found if such effects existed. Our initial test dive profile provided appreciable time both on bottom and during decompression to allow any differential thermal effects during these two dive phases to manifest, while affording a baseline risk of DCS that could be altered by thermal effects without exposing subjects to inordinately high risks of DCS. Our results strongly indicate that the optimal diver thermal conditions for mitigation of DCS risk or minimization of decompression time entail remaining cool during gas uptake phases of a dive and warm during off-gassing phases. While the dose-response characteristics of our observed thermal effects are almost certainly non-linear in both exposure temperature and duration, it is only reasonable to presume that the effects vary monotonically with these factors. We have no reason to presume that such responses and effects under less extreme conditions would be in directions opposite to those found under the conditions we tested. Similarly, responses to thermal exposures even more extreme than we tested might not be larger than the responses we observed, but it would be unwise to ignore the trends in our results under some unfounded presumption that the effects reverse with changes in thermal conditions beyond those tested. Finally, thermal effects on bottom and during decompression in dives to depths other than the 120 feet of sea water (fsw) or 150 fsw depths of the dives we tested are unlikely to be qualitatively different from those observed in our tested dives. The original question has therefore been answered: chill on bottom decreases DCS susceptibility while chill during decompression increases DCS susceptibility. Under conditions encountered by recreational or technical divers, the only open issue is arguably magnitudes of effects, not directions. Neither does lack of technology to control thermal status during a dive render our study results inapplicable. It only renders the diver unable to actively optimize his or her thermal exposure to minimize DCS risk or decompression obligation. Effects of diver thermal status on bottom hold regardless of whether the dive has a decompression long enough for a thermal effect to manifest in the decompression phase of the dive. We pointed out that US Navy decompression tables have historically been developed and validated with test dives in which divers were cold and working during bottom phases and cold and resting during decompression phases. Thus, our results indicate that it is not prudent for very warm divers to challenge the US Navy no-stop limits. However, becoming deliberately chilled on bottom only to remain cold during any ensuing decompression stops is similarly ill-advised. We agree with Clarke et al. that relative conservatism of some dive computer algorithms or alternative decompression tables, or the depth and time roundups necessary to determine table-based prescriptions, work in the diver's favour, but note that diving any profile to a shorter bottom time is a ready means to reduce the risk of DCS - i.e., enhance safety - without compromising comfort. Any active diver heating is best limited while on bottom to a minimal level required to safely complete on-bottom tasks, and dialled up only during decompression. Diver warming during decompression should not be so aggressive as to risk heat stress, and care should be taken to ensure that divers remain hydrated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415073/,2022-11-28 02:54:55 AM
Species-specific modulation of food-search behavior by respiration and chemosensation in Drosophila larvae,"Daeyeon Kim, Mar Alvarez, Laura M Lechuga, Matthieu Louis, Daeyeon Kim, Mar Alvarez, Laura M Lechuga, Matthieu Louis",2017 Sep 5,"Animals explore their environment to encounter suitable food resources. Despite its vital importance, this behavior puts individuals at risk by consuming limited internal energy during locomotion. We have developed a novel assay to investigate how food-search behavior is organized in Drosophila melanogaster larvae dwelling in hydrogels mimicking their natural habitat. We define three main behavioral modes: resting at the gel's surface, digging while feeding near the surface, and apneic dives. In unstimulated conditions, larvae spend most of their time digging. By contrast, deep and long exploratory dives are promoted by olfactory stimulations. Hypoxia and chemical repellents impair diving. We report remarkable differences in the dig-and-dive behavior of D. melanogaster and the fruit-pest D. suzukii. The present paradigm offers an opportunity to study how sensory and physiological cues are integrated to balance the limitations of dwelling in imperfect environmental conditions and the risks associated with searching for potentially more favorable conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28871963/,2022-11-28 02:54:56 AM
High doses of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride accelerate onset of CNS oxygen toxicity seizures in unanesthetized rats,"R Pilla, H E Held, C S Landon, J B Dean, R Pilla, H E Held, C S Landon, J B Dean",2013 Aug 29,"Pseudoephedrine (PSE) salts (hydrochloride and sulfate) are commonly used as nasal and paranasal decongestants by scuba divers. Anecdotal reports from the Divers Alert Network suggest that taking PSE prior to diving while breathing pure O₂ increases the risk for CNS oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT), which manifests as seizures. We hypothesized that high doses of PSE reduce the latency time to seizure (LS) in unanesthetized rats breathing 5 atmospheres absolute (ATA) of hyperbaric oxygen. Sixty-three male rats were implanted with radio-transmitters that recorded electroencephalogram activity and body temperature. After ≥7-day recovery, and 2 h before ""diving"", each rat was administered either saline solution (control) or PSE hydrochloride intragastrically at the following doses (mg PSE/kg): 0, 40, 80, 100, 120, 160, and 320. Rats breathed pure O₂ and were dived to 5ATA until the onset of behavioral seizures coincident with neurological seizures. LS was the time elapsed between reaching 5ATA and exhibiting seizures. We observed a significant dose-dependent decrease in the LS at doses of 100-320 mg/kg, whereas no significant differences in LS from control value were observed at doses ≤80 mg/kg. Our findings showed that high doses of PSE accelerate the onset of CNS-OT seizures in unanesthetized rats breathing 5ATA of poikilocapnic hyperoxia. Extrapolating our findings to humans, we conclude that the recommended daily dose of PSE should not be abused prior to diving with oxygen-enriched gas mixes or pure O₂.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23624060/,2022-11-28 02:54:57 AM
Management of pathologic fractures of the mandible secondary to osteoradionecrosis,"Raja Sawhney, Yadranko Ducic, Raja Sawhney, Yadranko Ducic",2013 Jan,"Objective:
        
      
      To review our experience with late Marx stage III osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible in patients who present with pathologic fracture.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Case series with chart review.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Tertiary care center.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      Thirty-seven patients were identified from June 1998 to August 2010 who underwent treatment of Marx grade III osteoradionecrosis with pathologic fracture of the mandible. All patients underwent reconstruction with osteocutaneous free tissue transfer and when possible underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy Marx protocol.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average time between completion of radiation therapy and presentation of ORN-induced pathologic fracture was 3.2 years. Sixteen patients developed ORN following tooth extraction. Sixteen patients had no previous documented ORN prior to presenting with pathologic fracture. Follow-up after surgery averaged 4.5 years with no recurrence of disease. The overall complication rate was 24% with no total flap loss. Of the patients, 95% returned to prefracture dietary intake. Twenty-six patients underwent a staged protocol, in which after resection and plate reconstruction, they underwent 20 hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) dives. They then underwent free tissue transfer followed by a further 10 HBO dives. There were no flaps lost or nonbony unions. Eleven patients did not receive HBO therapy as part of their surgical treatment plan. Again, there was no total flap loss, but 2 skin paddles were lost and 4 bony nonunions occurred.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pathologic fracture in conjunction with ORN has a relatively high treatment complication rate. Free tissue transfer and HBO are the treatment of choice for this population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23034514/,2022-11-28 02:54:58 AM

It often requires treatment in a pressure chamber. DCS with symptoms from the nervous system is particularly serious. In certain cases, the commonly used recompression table (USN TT6) does not suffice to revert severe neurological symptoms. A more advanced recompression table, COMEX 30, can be utilized in these cases. We report three cases of DCS where treatment according to COMEX 30 successfully resolved neurological symptoms. These cases illustrate the importance of fast and proper management of severe DCS and the need of hyperbaric centers staffed and equipped to give correct treatment.

Swimming-induced pulmonary edema in a tropical climate: a case report,"Wmj Kwek, M Seah, W Chow, Wmj Kwek, M Seah, W Chow",2017 May-Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs during strenuous physical exertion in cold water and has been reported in scuba divers, free-diving competitors, combat swimmers, and triathletes. We describe a case of SIPE in a combat swimmer in warm tropical waters.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      A 21-year old diver trainee developed dyspnea, chest discomfort and hemoptysis after performing a 2-km sea swim in water temperatures of around 30°C. Over a two-hour period, his oxygen saturations deteriorated. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. He was admitted to the general ward for observation and was given supportive treatment. His symptoms resolved over two days. Repeat CXR was normal. He was reviewed and certified fit to continue with diver training.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Much of the earlier literature on SIPE describes the development of symptoms after exposure to temperate waters as one main risk factor. This case highlights the risk of development of SIPE in warm tropical waters. With a low reported incidence of SIPE in warm waters, this condition is likely to be underdiagnosed. There is therefore a need to increase local awareness of SIPE in the medical community. A deliberate effort to collate data on SIPE in our local community will help us to better understand the pathophysiology of SIPE in the context of a tropical climate.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Development of SIPE in tropical waters suggests that other risk factors may be predominant. There should be a high index of suspicion when any strenuous in-water activity is conducted so that timely treatment may be instituted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28779587/,2022-11-28 02:54:59 AM
Fatal air embolism in a breath-hold diver,"Neil Dg Banham, John Lippmann, Neil Dg Banham, John Lippmann",2019 Dec 20,"Cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) from breath-holding or inadequate exhalation during ascent is a well-recognised complication of scuba diving. It does not usually occur with breath-hold (BH) diving in those with normal lungs, as the volume of gas in the lungs on surfacing cannot exceed what it was on leaving the surface. However, a BH diver who breathes from a compressed gas supply at depth essentially becomes a scuba diver and is at risk of pulmonary barotrauma (PBt) and CAGE on ascent. In this case, a 26-year-old male experienced BH diver breathed from a scuba set at approximately 10 metres' sea water depth and ascended, sustaining massive PBt and CAGE with a fatal outcome.

The duration of two carbon dioxide absorbents in a closed-circuit rebreather diving system,"David Harvey, Neal W Pollock, Nicholas Gant, Jason Hart, Peter Mesley, Simon J Mitchell, David Harvey, Neal W Pollock, Nicholas Gant, Jason Hart, Peter Mesley, Simon J Mitchell",2016 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diving rebreathers use canisters containing sodalime preparations to remove carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the expired gas. These preparations have a limited absorptive capacity and therefore may limit dive duration. The Inspiration™ rebreather is designed for use with Sofnolime 797™ but some divers use Spherasorb™ as an alternative. There are no published data comparing the CO2-absorbing efficacy of these sodalime preparations in an Inspiration rebreather.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An Inspiration rebreather was operated in a benchtop circuit under conditions simulating work at 6 metabolic equivalents (MET). Ventilation was maintained at 45 L·min⁻¹ (tidal volume 1·5 L; respiratory rate 30 min⁻¹) with CO₂ introduced to the expiratory limb at 2·L·min⁻¹. The PiCO₂ was continuously monitored in the inspiratory limb. The rebreather canister was packed to full volume with either Sofnolime or Spherasorb and 10 trials were conducted (five using each absorbent), in which the circuit was continuously run until the PiCO₂ reached 1 kPa ('breakthrough'). Peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures during tidal ventilation of the circuit were also recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean operating duration to CO₂ breakthrough was 138 ± 4 (SD) minutes for 2.38·kg Spherasorb and 202 ± minutes for 2.64·kg Sofnolime (P < 0.0001). The difference between peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures was 10% less during use of Spherasorb, suggesting lower work of breathing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Under conditions simulating work at 6 MET during use of an Inspiration rebreather a canister packed with Spherasorb reached CO₂ breakthrough 32% earlier with 10% less mass than Sofnolime packed to similar volume. Divers cannot alternate between these two preparations and expect the same endurance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27334997/,2022-11-28 02:55:02 AM
A study of decompression sickness using recorded depth-time profiles,"Richard G Dunford, Petar D Denoble, Robert Forbes, Carl F Pieper, Laurens E Howle, Richard D Vann, Richard G Dunford, Petar D Denoble, Robert Forbes, Carl F Pieper, Laurens E Howle, Richard D Vann",2020 First Quarter,"Introduction:
        
      
      122,129 dives by 10,358 recreational divers were recorded by dive computers from 11 manufacturers in an exploratory study of how dive profile, breathing gas (air or nitrox [N2/O2] mixes), repetitive diving, gender, age, and dive site conditions influenced observed decompression sickness (DCSobs). Thirty-eight reports were judged as DCS. Overall DCSobs was 3.1 cases/10⁴ dives.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three dive groups were studied: Basic (live-aboard and shore/dayboat), Cozumel Dive Guides, and Scapa Flow wreck divers. A probabilistic decompression model, BVM(3), controlled dive profile variability. Chi-squared test, t-test, logistic regression, and log-rank tests evaluated statistical associations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      (a) DCSobs was 0.7/10⁴ (Basic), 7.6/10⁴ (Guides), and 17.3/104 (Scapa) and differed after control for dive variability (p ≺ 0.001). (b) DCSobs was greater for 22%-29% nitrox (12.6/10⁴) than for 30%-50% nitrox (2.04/10⁴) (p ≤ 0.0064) which did not differ from air (2.97/1010⁴). (c) For daily repetitive dives (≺12-hour surface intervals (SI)), DCS occurred only following one or two dives (4.3/1010⁴ DCSobs; p ≺ 0.001) where SIs were shorter than after three or more dives. (d) For multiday repetitive dives (SIs ≺ 48 hours), DCS was associated with high multiday repetitive dive counts only for Guides (p = 0.0018). (e) DCSobs decreased with age at 3%/year (p ≤ 0.0144). (f) Males dived deeper (p ≺ 0.001) but for less time than females (p ≺ 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Collecting dive profiles with dive computers and controlling for profile variability by probabilistic modeling was feasible, but analytical results require independent confirmation due to limited observed DCS. Future studies appear promising if more DCS cases are gathered, stakeholders cooperate, and identified data collection problems are corrected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32176949/,2022-11-28 02:55:03 AM
Ultrasound detection of vascular decompression bubbles: the influence of new technology and considerations on bubble load,"S Lesley Blogg, Mikael Gennser, Andreas Møllerløkken, Alf O Brubakk, S Lesley Blogg, Mikael Gennser, Andreas Møllerløkken, Alf O Brubakk",2014 Mar,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diving often causes the formation of 'silent' bubbles upon decompression. If the bubble load is high, then the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) and the number of bubbles that could cross to the arterial circulation via a pulmonary shunt or patent foramen ovale increase. Bubbles can be monitored aurally, with Doppler ultrasound, or visually, with two dimensional (2D) ultrasound imaging. Doppler grades and imaging grades can be compared with good agreement. Early 2D imaging units did not provide such comprehensive observations as Doppler, but advances in technology have allowed development of improved, portable, relatively inexpensive units. Most now employ harmonic technology; it was suggested that this could allow previously undetectable bubbles to be observed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This paper provides a review of current methods of bubble measurement and how new technology may be changing our perceptions of the potential relationship of these measurements to decompression illness. Secondly, 69 paired ultrasound images were made using conventional 2D ultrasound imaging and harmonic imaging. Images were graded on the Eftedal-Brubakk (EB) scale and the percentage agreement of the images calculated. The distribution of mismatched grades was analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-four of the 69 paired images had matching grades. There was no significant difference in the distribution of high or low EB grades for the mismatched pairs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Given the good level of agreement between pairs observed, it seems unlikely that harmonic technology is responsible for any perceived increase in observed bubble loads, but it is probable that our increasing use of 2D ultrasound to assess dive profiles is changing our perception of 'normal' venous and arterial bubble loads. Methods to accurately investigate the load and size of bubbles developed will be helpful in the future in determining DCS risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24687484/,2022-11-28 02:55:04 AM
Habitat geography around Hawaii's oceanic islands influences tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) spatial behaviour and shark bite risk at ocean recreation sites,"Carl G Meyer, James M Anderson, Daniel M Coffey, Melanie R Hutchinson, Mark A Royer, Kim N Holland, Carl G Meyer, James M Anderson, Daniel M Coffey, Melanie R Hutchinson, Mark A Royer, Kim N Holland",2018 Mar 21,"We compared tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) spatial behaviour among 4 Hawaiian Islands to evaluate whether local patterns of movement could explain higher numbers of shark bites seen around Maui than other islands. Our sample consisted of 96 electronically-tagged (satellite and acoustic transmitters) tiger sharks, individually tracked for up to 6 years. Most individuals showed fidelity to a specific 'home' island, but also swam between islands and sometimes ranged far (up to 1,400 km) offshore. Movements were primarily oriented to insular shelf habitat (0-200 m depth) in coastal waters, and individual sharks utilized core-structured home ranges within this habitat. Core utilization areas of large tiger sharks were closer to high-use ocean recreation sites around Maui, than around Oahu. Tiger sharks routinely visited shallow ocean recreation sites around Maui and were detected on more days overall at ocean recreation sites around Maui (62-80%) than Oahu (<6%). Overall, our results suggest the extensive insular shelf surrounding Maui supports a fairly resident population of tiger sharks and also attracts visiting tiger sharks from elsewhere in Hawaii. Collectively these natural, habitat-driven spatial patterns may in-part explain why Maui has historically had more shark bites than other Hawaiian Islands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29563552/,2022-11-28 02:55:05 AM
Oxygen exposure and toxicity in recreational technical divers,"Andrew Fock, Richard Harris, Michael Slade, Andrew Fock, Richard Harris, Michael Slade",2013 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Central nervous system oxygen toxicity is a recognised risk in recreational open-circuit scuba diving with the use of nitrox (oxygen-enriched air mixtures), but other forms of oxygen toxicity in other diving settings are poorly understood. However, divers using constant partial pressure of oxygen closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) for multi-day, multi-dive expeditions could potentially experience cumulative oxygen exposures above the current recommended limits.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We followed a number of technical recreational diving expeditions using CCRs and recorded the cumulative oxygen exposures of the individual divers. Lung function and visual acuity were recorded at intervals during the expeditions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over several 8- to 12-day expeditions, divers either approached or exceeded the recommended maximum repetition excursion oxygen exposure (REPEX) limits. Lung function did not show any significant decrement. Changes in visual acuity were reported in several divers but were difficult to quantify. Formal testing of one diver's visual acuity on return home demonstrated a myopic change that resolved over the subsequent eight weeks.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Recreational CCR divers conducting multi-dive expeditions of eight days or more may approach or exceed the REPEX oxygen limits. Despite this, there does not appear to be any significant decrement in lung function. Hyperoxic myopia occurs in some individuals. Changes in acuity appear to resolve spontaneously post exposure. Despite the lack of significant changes in respiratory function, divers should be cautious of such exposures as, should they require recompression therapy for decompression illness, this may result in significant pulmonary oxygen toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813459/,2022-11-28 02:55:06 AM

      Deep dives using rebreather devices result in oxygen exposures that carry a risk of cerebral oxygen toxicity. Elevation of arterial CO2 levels increases this risk. CO2 retention may occur during the deep working phases of dives, but it has not been investigated in 'real world' dives at the end of resting decompression when oxygen exposures are peaking, often to levels higher than recommended maxima.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted an observational field study to measure end tidal CO2 (Petco2) in divers surfacing after decompression. Sixteen rebreather divers conducted two dives and two completed one dive (a total of 34 dives) to depths ranging from 44-55 msw. Bottom times ranged from 35 to 56 min and time spent on decompression ranged from 40 to 92 min. The first breaths on reaching the surface after removing the rebreather mouthpiece were taken through a portable capnograph. The Petco2 was recorded for the first breath that produced a clean capnography trace. Petco2 measurement was repeated for each subject 2-3 h after diving to give paired observations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no differences between mean surfacing Petco2 [36.8 mmHg (SD 3.0)] and the mean Petco2 made later after diving [36.9 mmHg (SD 4.0)]. One subject on one dive returned a surfacing Petco2 higher than a nominal upper limit of 45 mmHg.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      We found no general tendency to CO2 retention during decompression. It is plausible that breaching oxygen exposure limits during resting decompression is less hazardous than equivalent breaches when exercising at deep depths. Mitchell SJ, Mesley P, Hannam JA.

"Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO), Personality Traits, and Iterative Decompression Sickness. Retrospective Analysis of 209 Cases","Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, Dirk Caers, Peter Germonpré, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, Dirk Caers, Peter Germonpré",2017 Aug 2,"Introduction: There is a need to evaluate the influence of risk factors such as patency of foramen ovale (PFO) or ""daredevil"" psychological profile on contra-indication policy after a decompression sickness (DCS). Methods: By crossing information obtained from Belgian Hyperbaric Centers, DAN Emergency Hotline, the press, and Internet diving forums, it was possible to be accountable for the majority if not all DCS, which have occurred in Belgium from January 1993 to June 2013. From the available 594 records we excluded all cases with tentative diagnosis, medullary DCS or unreliability of reported dive profile, leaving 209 divers records with cerebral DCS for analysis. Demographics, dive parameters, and PFO grading were recorded. Twenty-three injured divers were tested using the Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale V and compared to a matched group not involved in risky activities. Results: 41.2% of all injured came for iterative DCS. The average depth significantly increases with previous occurrences of DCS (1st DCS: 31.8 ± 7.9 mfw; 2nd DCS: 35.5 ± 9.8 mfw; 3rd DCS: 43.4 ± 6.1 mfw). There is also an increase of PFO prevalence among multiple injured divers (1st DCS: 66.4% 2nd & 3rd DCS: 100%) with a significant increase in PFO grade. Multiple-times injured significantly scored higher than control group on thrill and adventure seeking (TAS), experience seeking, boredom susceptibility and total score. Conclusion: There is an inability of injured diver to adopt conservative dive profile after a DCS. Further work is needed to ascertain whether selected personality characteristics or PFO should be taken into account in the clearance decision to resume diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28824507/,2022-11-28 02:55:07 AM
Case report: clearance to dive for a naval candidate with family history of malignant hyperthermia,"John A Vigilante, John A Vigilante",2013 Jul-Aug,"Introduction:
        
      
      A 20-year-old male military recruit who presented for a screening physical for U.S.Naval Diving Duty was found to have family history significant for malignant hyperthermia. He had never been exposed to anesthesia, a trigger for the condition, and had not undergone testing. Medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and the patient was cleared for diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature search was conducted using PubMed/Medline. Keywords included malignant hyperthermia, exertional heat illness, exertional rhabdomyolysis, diving, special operations, military. Results that included cases of malignant hyperthermia were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Review of the literature reveals that malignant hyperthermia is primary a pharmacogenetic disorder limited to specific anesthetics, with rare reports of environmental triggers. Analysis of the disease, as well as the absence of reported cases of malignant hyperthermia in diving, suggest there is minimal increased risk in diving for subjects without history of exercise intolerance.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Individuals with presumed or proven malignant hyperthermia susceptibility seeking activity clearance should be given precautions and undergo careful questioning for history of heat- or exercise-related illness. If negative, it seems reasonable to allow the patient participation in recreational or technical diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23957207/,2022-11-28 02:55:08 AM
Effect of catheter-based patent foramen ovale closure on the occurrence of arterial bubbles in scuba divers,"Jakub Honěk, Martin Srámek, Luděk Sefc, Jaroslav Januška, Jiří Fiedler, Martin Horváth, Aleš Tomek, Stěpán Novotný, Tomáš Honěk, Josef Veselka, Jakub Honěk, Martin Srámek, Luděk Sefc, Jaroslav Januška, Jiří Fiedler, Martin Horváth, Aleš Tomek, Stěpán Novotný, Tomáš Honěk, Josef Veselka",2014 Apr,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study sought to evaluate the effect of catheter-based patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure on the occurrence of arterial bubbles after simulated dives.
    


          Background:
        
      
      PFO is a risk factor of decompression sickness in divers due to paradoxical embolization of bubbles. To date, the effectiveness of catheter-based PFO closure in the reduction of arterial bubbles has not been demonstrated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 47 divers (age 35.4 ± 8.6 years, 81% men) with a PFO (PFO group) or treated with a catheter-based PFO closure (closure group) were enrolled in this case-controlled observational trial. All divers were examined after a simulated dive in a hyperbaric chamber: 34 divers (19 in the PFO group, 15 in the closure group) performed a dive to 18 m for 80 min, and 13 divers (8 in the PFO group, 5 in the closure group) performed a dive to 50 m for 20 min. Within 60 min after surfacing, the presence of venous and arterial bubbles was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography and transcranial color-coded sonography, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After the 18-m dive, venous bubbles were detected in 74% of divers in the PFO group versus 80% in the closure group (p = 1.0), and arterial bubbles were detected in 32% versus 0%, respectively (p = 0.02). After the 50-m dive, venous bubbles were detected in 88% versus 100%, respectively (p = 1.0), and arterial bubbles were detected in 88% versus 0%, respectively (p < 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      No difference was observed in the occurrence of venous bubbles between the PFO and closure groups, but the catheter-based PFO closure led to complete elimination of arterial bubbles after simulated dives.

The Key Roles of Negative Pressure Breathing and Exercise in the Development of Interstitial Pulmonary Edema in Professional Male SCUBA Divers,"Olivier Castagna, Jacques Regnard, Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, François Xavier Brocq, Bruno Schmid, Anne-Virginie Desruelle, Valentin Crunel, Adrien Maurin, Romain Chopard, David Hunter MacIver, Olivier Castagna, Jacques Regnard, Emmanuel Gempp, Pierre Louge, François Xavier Brocq, Bruno Schmid, Anne-Virginie Desruelle, Valentin Crunel, Adrien Maurin, Romain Chopard, David Hunter MacIver",2018 Jan 3,"Background:
        
      
      Immersion pulmonary edema is potentially a catastrophic condition; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms are ill-defined. This study assessed the individual and combined effects of exertion and negative pressure breathing on the cardiovascular system during the development of pulmonary edema in SCUBA divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixteen male professional SCUBA divers performed four SCUBA dives in a freshwater pool at 1 m depth while breathing air at either a positive or negative pressure both at rest or with exercise. Echocardiography and lung ultrasound were used to assess the cardiovascular changes and lung comet score (a measure of interstitial pulmonary edema).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ultrasound lung comet score was 0 following both the dives at rest regardless of breathing pressure. Following exercise, the mean comet score rose to 4.2 with positive pressure breathing and increased to 15.1 with negative pressure breathing. The development of interstitial pulmonary edema was significantly related to inferior vena cava diameter, right atrial area, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, right ventricular fractional area change, and pulmonary artery pressure. Exercise combined with negative pressure breathing induced the greatest changes in these cardiovascular indices and lung comet score.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A diver using negative pressure breathing while exercising is at greatest risk of developing interstitial pulmonary edema. The development of immersion pulmonary edema is closely related to hemodynamic changes in the right but not the left ventricle. Our findings have important implications for divers and understanding the mechanisms of pulmonary edema in other clinical settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29299780/,2022-11-28 02:55:10 AM
Exercise during hot-water immersion in divers habituated to hot-dry and hot-wet conditions,"Courtney E Wheelock, David P Looney, Adam W Potter, Riana R Pryor, J Luke Pryor, John Florian, David Hostler, Courtney E Wheelock, David P Looney, Adam W Potter, Riana R Pryor, J Luke Pryor, John Florian, David Hostler",2022 Second Quarter,"Purpose:
        
      
      Diving in warm water increases thermal risk during exercise compared to thermoneutral waters. The purpose of this study was to evaluate exercise endurance in warm- and hot-water conditions in divers habituated to wet or dry heat.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nineteen male divers completed this study at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. Subjects were assigned DRY or WET heat habituation groups. The DRY group (n=9) cycled at 125-150W for one hour in a non-immersed condition (34.4˚C, 50%RH), while the WET group (n=10) cycled at 50W for one hour while immersed in 34.4˚C water. Exercise time to exhaustion was tested on an underwater cycle ergometer in 35.8˚C (WARM) and 37.2˚C (HOT) water at 50W. Core temperature (Tc) was continuously recorded and for all dives.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Time to exhaustion was reduced in HOT compared to WARM water (p ≺0.01) in both DRY (92.7 ± 41.6 minutes in 35.8°C vs. 43.4 ± 17.5 minutes in 37.2°C) and WET (95.9 ± 39.2 minutes in 35.8°C vs. 53.4 ± 27.5 minutes in 37.2°C) groups, but did not differ between groups (p=0.62). Rate of Tc rise was greater with higher water temperature (p ≺0.01), but was not different between groups (p=0.68). Maximum Tc (p=0.94 and p=0.95) and Tc change from baseline (p=0.38 and p=0.34) was not different between water temperatures or habituation group, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Endurance decreased with increased water temperature but was not different between WET and DRY. Divers became exhausted at a similar core temperature during WARM- and HOT-water exercise.

It seems probable that myelin can represent, in hyperbaric conditions, a preferential site for the accumulation of N2 in central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this study is to verify whether the practice of the scuba diving is capable to determine a damage of the brain white matter (WM) in a dose dependent manner and, consequently, possible deficiency of their cognitive abilities. For this purpose, 54 professional scuba divers (35 men and 19 women), with at least 2,000 dives in their careers, were studied. Possible alterations of brain WM were evaluated in terms of Fractional anisotropy (FA) by using Diffusion Tensor Imaging, whereas possible cognitive impairments were verified by means of neuropsychological testing, by studying: (1) General mental capability (2) Executive functioning; (3) Visuospatial construction such as Rey Complex Figure; (4) Attention and orientation: (5) Selective attention capacity and processing speed ability; (6) Memory. The results showed alteration of the WM in terms of changes in FA; these alterations, statistically significant but quantitatively quite modest, were mainly observed in the WM of the anterior part of the brain, whereas no differences were observed between left and right hemisphere. The alterations of the WM were associated with changes, also in this case statistically significant but quantitatively quite modest, of the cognitive functions, in particular of those dependent on the prefrontal cortex, such as attention and memory function. The present study leads to the conclusion that repeated dives, even performed in compliance with the current decompression tables, can progressively lead in the CNS to the formation of micro-lesions in the myelin sheet capable of altering the functioning of the neuron.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31695655/,2022-11-28 02:55:13 AM

Living and working in a fishing port in Yucatan, he had a prior history of DCS. A diagnosis of avascular necrosis in the left femoral head secondary to DCS was made via analysis of clinical and radiological findings. The necrosis was surgically resolved by a total hip arthroplasty. Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a more probable diagnosis. In this region fishermen undergo significant decompression stress in their daily fishing efforts. Further studies regarding prevalence of dysbaric osteonecrosis among small-scale fisheries divers are needed.

However, while there are theories to explain the deaths, little physiological data exists about the way the FFSMs provide gas to an exercising subject. To evaluate the safety of the FFSM concept, this study was designed to test how use of a full face snorkel mask (FFSM) may be physiologically different than use of a conventional snorkel, and to assess if any of those differences could lead to increased risk for the snorkeler. Ten (10) volunteer human subjects were tested using a variety of commercially available FFSMs, with real-time monitoring of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), inspired airway pressure, and inspired and expired levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Two of the three FFSM design types were shown not to function as advertised, but none of the masks provided physiologically problematic gas supplies to the snorkelers. While this testing yielded no conclusive ""smoking gun"" to explain the snorkeler deaths, some of the mask models showed patterns of increasing breathing resistance with water intrusion because of a shared design characteristic, and this increased resistance could potentially create elevated levels of respiratory distress to snorkelers during real-world use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35226974/,2022-11-28 02:55:14 AM
Study of the relation between medial orbitofrontal artery and anterior skull base performed by computed tomography angiography,"H C Patricio, A Felippu, C D Pinheiro-Neto, L U Sennes, H C Patricio, A Felippu, C D Pinheiro-Neto, L U Sennes",2018 Jun 1,"Background:
        
      
      The aims of this study were to analyze the relationships between the medial orbitofrontal artery (MOFA) and the anterior skull base (ASB) including anatomical endonasal landmarks using computed tomography angiography (CTA).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We studied 52 CTAs using OsiriX software. All CTAs were placed in the same anatomical position. MOFA was identified in the sagittal and coronal plane and its correlation with ASB was analyzed. The distance between the MOFA and landmarks for endonasal surgery were obtained, determining the high risk areas for its injury.

      Patent foramen ovale (PFO) with occasional right-to-left shunting is associated with an increased risk of decompression illness (DCI). Divers with a history of repetitive or severe DCI and diagnosed with PFO should be considered for transcatheter closure if they wish to continue with unrestricted diving.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To summarise our centre's experience in transcatheter PFO closure in professional divers with a history of DCI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A follow-up of 11 consecutive divers (nine males, two females) in whom device PFO closure was performed between 2001 and 2015 was carried out by phone contact. Available medical records and diving logbooks were reviewed to determine individual DCI symptomatology, indications to the procedure, and to evaluate modifications in the diving practice.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Each patient experienced at least one event of DCI before the procedure, and eight patients experienced more than one event. Total number of reported events was 62. The vast majority of events (97%) followed dives consistent with safe decompression policies. The median follow-up was 91 (minimum nine, maximum 172) months. No complications of the intervention were observed. All patients returned to unrestricted, deep diving, performing a total of 3610 dives with the median number of 225 dives (lower quartile value: 82.5 dives, upper quartile value: 725 dives). The majority of subjects dived as deep as they did before the intervention, or deeper, achieving mean maximum depth of 93.8 ± 35.6 m (vs. 89.7 ± 25.9 m before the intervention, p = 0.71). No episodes of DCI were reported during the follow-up period.

The panic triangle: onset of panic in scuba divers,"Laura Walton, Laura Walton",2018 Sep-Oct,"Panic arising from physical or psychological stress is a common issue in reported incidents and accidents in scuba diving. Due to its effect on perception, thinking and diver behavior, the panic reaction is often a significant factor in the generation or escalation of problems, potentially leading to injuries and fatalities. The instinctive behaviors associated with panic are incompatible with the constraints of scuba diving (e.g., flight response to threat, leading to rapid ascent). Although the dangers are well known, the psychological mechanisms of panic and the implications for prevention/risk reduction are not sufficiently highlighted to recreational divers. In applied psychology, there are grounded theoretical models which describe the onset and maintenance of anxiety and panic, and an evidence base for approaches to anxiety management. For example, these models are used within structured psychological approaches for people experiencing anxiety disorders; and panic attacks are resolvable. Based on these models and underlying theory, this article proposes a new, accessible model for panic in divers. The potential uses of the model are to: (1) provide a simple framework for divers to understand the onset of panic; (2) promote the need for adequate training; (3) describe the importance of staying within training standards, qualifications and personal limitations; (4) support diver and dive educator understanding of individual factors in panic reactions (e.g. psychiatric conditions) placing greater emphasis on psychological fitness to dive; and (5) draw attention to approaches to improved regulation of emotion and promote individual responsibility.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30428239/,2022-11-28 02:55:16 AM
Can my patient dive after a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax? A systematic review of the literature,"M Alvarez Villela, S Dunworth, N P Harlan, R E Moon, M Alvarez Villela, S Dunworth, N P Harlan, R E Moon",2018 Mar-Apr,"Introduction:
        
      
      Patients with prior primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) frequently seek clearance to dive. Despite wide consensus in precluding compressed-air diving in this population, there is a paucity of data to support this decision. We reviewed the literature reporting the risk of PSP recurrence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science using predefined terms. Studies published in English reporting the recurrence rate after a first PSP were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty studies (n=3,904) were included. Risk of PSP recurrence ranged 0-67% (22 ± 15.5%; mean ± SD). Mean follow-up was 36 months, and 63 ± 39% of recurrences occurred during the first year of follow-up. Elevated height/weight ratio and emphysema-like changes (ELCs) are associated with PSP recurrence. ELCs are present in 59%-89% (vs. 0-15%) of patients with recurrence and can be detected effectively with high-resolution CT scan (sensitivity of 84-88%). Surgical pleurodesis reduces the risk of recurrence substantially (4.0 ± 4% vs. 22 ± 15.5%).
    


          Conclusion2:

Effectiveness of an adapted diving mask (Owner mask) for non-invasive ventilation in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Dulciane Nunes Paiva, Litiele Evelin Wagner, Sônia Elvira Dos Santos Marinho, Carlos Fernando Drumond Dornelles, Juliana Fernandes de Souza Barbosa, Patrícia Érika de Melo Marinho, Dulciane Nunes Paiva, Litiele Evelin Wagner, Sônia Elvira Dos Santos Marinho, Carlos Fernando Drumond Dornelles, Juliana Fernandes de Souza Barbosa, Patrícia Érika de Melo Marinho",2022 Mar 18,"Background:
        
      
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated to avoid orotracheal intubation (OTI) to reduce hospital stay and mortality. Patients infected by SARS-CoV2 can progress to respiratory failure (RF); however, in the initial phase, they can be submitted to oxygen therapy and NIV. Such resources can produce aerosol and can cause a high risk of contagion to health professionals. Safe NIV strategies are sought, and therefore, the authors adapted diving masks to be used as NIV masks (called an Owner mask).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the Owner mask safety and effectiveness regarding conventional orofacial mask for patients in respiratory failure with and without confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Brazilian multicentric study to assess patients admitted to the intensive care unit regarding their clinical, sociodemographic and anthropometric data. The primary outcome will be the rate of tracheal intubation, and secondary outcomes will include in-hospital mortality, the difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and PaCO2 levels, time in the intensive care unit and hospitalization time, adverse effects, degree of comfort and level of satisfaction of the mask use, success rate of NIV (not progressing to OTI), and behavior of the ventilatory variables obtained in NIV with an Owner mask and with a conventional face mask. Patients with COVID-19 and clinical signs indicative of RF will be submitted to NIV with an Owner mask [NIV Owner COVID Group (n = 63)] or with a conventional orofacial mask [NIV orofacial COVID Group (n = 63)], and those patients in RF due to causes not related to COVID-19 will be allocated into the NIV Owner Non-COVID Group (n = 97) or to the NIV Orofacial Non-COVID Group (n = 97) in a randomized way, which will total 383 patients, admitting 20% for loss to follow-up.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This is the first randomized and controlled trial during the COVID-19 pandemic about the safety and effectiveness of the Owner mask compared to the conventional orofacial mask. Experimental studies have shown that the Owner mask enables adequate sealing on the patient's face and the present study is relevant as it aims to minimize the aerosolization of the virus in the environment and improve the safety of health professionals.

Ceiling-controlled versus staged decompression: comparison between decompression duration and tissue tensions,"Sergio A Angelini, Lorenzo Tonetto, Michael A Lang, Sergio A Angelini, Lorenzo Tonetto, Michael A Lang",2022 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      In dissolved gas decompression algorithms, the ceiling is the depth at which the dissolved gas pressure in at least one tissue equals the maximum tolerated value defined by the algorithm. Staged decompression prescribes stationary stops in three-metre intervals so as to never exceed this maximum tolerated value. This keeps the diver deeper than the ceiling until the ceiling itself decreases to coincide with the next, three-metre shallower stage. Ceiling-controlled decompression follows the ceiling in a continuous ascent.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Mathematical simulations using the ZH-L16C decompression algorithm and gradient factors were carried out for several dive profiles to compare patterns of tissue gas supersaturation and overall decompression times for decompressions based on these approaches.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During a stationary staged decompression stop the available pressure gradient for inert gas washout diminished as inert gas is washed out while inhaled inert gas partial pressure remained unchanged. Ceiling-controlled decompression, on the other hand, maintained the available pressure gradient for inert gas washout at its maximum tolerated level. Decompressions were 4-12% shorter using ceiling-controlled approaches but at the cost of exposing tissues with faster half times to higher levels of supersaturation than they would experience during staged decompression.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Ceiling controlled approaches accelerate decompression but the effect of this on the risk of decompression sickness is unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313367/,2022-11-28 02:55:18 AM
Initial review of the U.S. Navy's pressurized submarine escape training outcomes,"Seth W O'Donnell, Wayne G Horn, Seth W O'Donnell, Wayne G Horn",2014 Jan-Feb,"The U.S. Navy reinstituted pressurized submarine escape training (PSET) for submarine sailors in 2009 after a nearly 30-year absence. This training addresses escape from a disabled submarine at depth with the use of the Beaufort, Ltd. Mk 10 Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment (SEIE) suit. Training is classified as ""high-risk"" due to previous U.S. and foreign navy experience with training-associated morbidity and mortality, particularly from diving-related illness. To reduce risk, medical screening procedures are performed. During the first 39 months of training, 7,025 students screened for PSET with 32% completing all phases, including two pressurized ascents.

Factors associated with residual symptoms after recompression in type I decompression sickness,"Jungyoup Lee, Kyuseok Kim, Sunkyun Park, Jungyoup Lee, Kyuseok Kim, Sunkyun Park",2015 Mar,"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to investigate factors associated with residual symptoms after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in type I decompression sickness (DCS).
    


          Basic procedures:
        
      
      An HBOT registry, which includes patients with type I DCS, was analyzed retrospectively. We divided enrolled patients into two groups; complete resolution group and residual symptom (RS) group after a single HBOT session. We investigated factors associated with residual symptoms at discharge with univariable and multivariable analyses. Restrictive cubic spline curve and a test for trend analysis were used to show the trend of therapeutic response after HBOT based on time from symptom onset to HBOT.
    


          Main findings:
        
      
      In a total of 195 patients, 131 (67.2%) patients were included in the RS group after single HBOT. Prolonged time from symptom onset to recompression was independently associated with residual symptoms (P = .004). When patients who underwent recompression within 24 hours from symptom were included in the reference group, the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) (95% confidence interval) of residual symptoms after HBOT were the following: 24 to 96 hours, 2.24 (0.75-6.65); 96 to 240 hours, 3.31 (1.08-10.13); more than 240 hours, 22.83 (2.45-231.43). In terms of sort of diving, commercial and recreational divers had higher probability of residual symptoms than military divers (AOR, 4.78 and 33.36, respectively).
    


          Principal conclusions:
        
      
      Early HBOT is associated with rapid symptom elimination after treatment in type I DCS. Military divers showed a more immediate response after recompression in comparison with commercial and recreational divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25636518/,2022-11-28 02:55:19 AM
Clustering of recreational divers by their health conditions in a database of a citizen science project,"Tamer Ozyigit, Cuneyt Yavuz, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni, Tamer Ozyigit, Cuneyt Yavuz, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni",2019,"Divers Alert Network Europe has created a database with a large amount of dive-related data that has been collected since 1993 within the scope of the Diving Safety Laboratory citizen science project. The main objectives of this study are the grouping divers by their health information and revealing significant differences in diving parameters using data mining techniques. Due to the methodology of the project, data cleaning was performed before applying clustering methods in order to eliminate potential mistakes resulting from inaccuracies and missing information. Despite the fact that 63% of the data were lost during the cleaning phase, the remaining 1,169 ""clean"" diver data enabled meaningful clustering using the ""two-step"" method. Experienced male divers without any health problems are in Cluster 1. Male and female divers with health problems and high rates of cigarette smoking are in Cluster 2; healthy, overweight divers are in Cluster 3. There are significant differences in terms of dive parameters including pre- and post-dive conditions with respect to each group, such as: exercise level, alcohol consumption, thermal comfort, equipment malfunctions, and maximum depth. The study proves the usefulness of citizen science projects, while data collection methodologies can be improved to decrease potential mistakes resulting from inconsistencies, inaccuracies and missing information. It is hypothesized that if naturally occurring clusters of divers were identified it might be possible to identify risk factors arising from different clusters while merging the database with other dive accident databases in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051062/,2022-11-28 02:55:20 AM
Hypertension screening of commercial divers from an occupational medicine perspective,"Alejandro Garbino, Robert W Sanders, Charles H Mathers, Alejandro Garbino, Robert W Sanders, Charles H Mathers",2017 Mar-Apr,"Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world: in the United States, it affects one-third of the adult population. Most cases are primary hypertension - with no identified cause - and significantly increase risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke. At NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL), there is a cadre of professional divers who provide underwater support during extravehicular activity training (EVAs, commonly referred to as ""spacewalks"") for astronauts. The NBL occupational health program requires regular ""work-site"" physical exams, including blood pressure checks, on at least a weekly basis. Although some blood pressures measured during such regular checks were elevated, the diagnosis and management of blood pressure was outside the scope of that occupational medicine program. As a result, there was no protocol to analyze and manage asymptomatic elevated blood pressure if and when it warranted physician follow-up. We therefore analyzed the blood pressure data from all divers in 2015, vetted the worksite physical and developed a referral pathway to ensure divers have access to effective management of their blood pressure while minimizing impact of such a program on daily operations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28777903/,2022-11-28 02:55:21 AM
A twelve-year longitudinal study of neuropsychological function in non-saturation professional divers,"Rita Bast-Pettersen, Øivind Skare, Karl-Christian Nordby, Marit Skogstad, Rita Bast-Pettersen, Øivind Skare, Karl-Christian Nordby, Marit Skogstad",2015 Aug,"Objectives:
        
      
      Our main aim was to study the long-term neuropsychological effects of non-saturation diving. Further, we aimed to investigate whether neuropsychological performance was predictive of subsequent diving accidents and diving status.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective longitudinal study, we enrolled 50 male diving students (mean age 25.3 years) at a diving school and followed them up six and 12 years later (43 and 37 divers, respectively). At each wave of the study, divers completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and answered questionnaires on cumulative number of dives, incidents of decompression illness (DCI) and professional diver status.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At the 12-year follow-up, the divers reported a median number of 455 (range 40-5,604) cumulative dives. Cumulative number of dives was not associated with any adverse neuropsychological effects. However, divers with an incident of DCI performed worse in a memory test (Benton Visual Retention Test) and reported slightly more neuropsychiatric symptoms (Q 16). Diver students who performed well on a blindfolded memory test (tactual performance test) had an increased likelihood of becoming a professional diver 12 years later.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The main findings in the present study support the view that asymptomatic non-saturation divers who have dived under controlled conditions do not have an increased risk of impaired nervous system function, at least not to an extent that can be detected with neuropsychological tests while they still are relatively young. The observed associations between a history of DCI and impaired results in a memory test and reporting of neuropsychiatric symptoms may be due to a nervous system effect caused by DCI. The diver students' ability of problem-solving while they were blindfolded was predictive of their likelihood of becoming a professional diver 12 years later.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25355537/,2022-11-28 02:55:22 AM
"Probabilistic pharmacokinetic models of decompression sickness in humans, part 1: Coupled perfusion-limited compartments","F Gregory Murphy, Ethan A Hada, David J Doolette, Laurens E Howle, F Gregory Murphy, Ethan A Hada, David J Doolette, Laurens E Howle",2017 Jul 1,"Decompression sickness (DCS) is a disease caused by gas bubbles forming in body tissues following a reduction in ambient pressure, such as occurs in scuba diving. Probabilistic models for quantifying the risk of DCS are typically composed of a collection of independent, perfusion-limited theoretical tissue compartments which describe gas content or bubble volume within these compartments. It has been previously shown that 'pharmacokinetic' gas content models, with compartments coupled in series, show promise as predictors of the incidence of DCS. The mechanism of coupling can be through perfusion or diffusion. This work examines the application of five novel pharmacokinetic structures with compartments coupled by perfusion to the prediction of the probability and time of onset of DCS in humans. We optimize these models against a training set of human dive trial data consisting of 4335 exposures with 223 DCS cases. Further, we examine the extrapolation quality of the models on an additional set of human dive trial data consisting of 3140 exposures with 147 DCS cases. We find that pharmacokinetic models describe the incidence of DCS for single air bounce dives better than a single-compartment, perfusion-limited model. We further find the U.S. Navy LEM-NMRI98 is a better predictor of DCS risk for the entire training set than any of our pharmacokinetic models. However, one of the pharmacokinetic models we consider, the CS2T3 model, is a better predictor of DCS risk for single air bounce dives and oxygen decompression dives. Additionally, we find that LEM-NMRI98 outperforms CS2T3 on the extrapolation data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28505552/,2022-11-28 02:55:22 AM
Arterial gas embolism breathing compressed air in 1.2 metres of water,"Neil B Hampson, Richard E Moon, Neil B Hampson, Richard E Moon",2020 Sep 30,Arterial gas embolism (AGE) may result when diving while breathing compressed gas and ascending rapidly or with a closed glottis. Pulmonary over-pressurisation can result in lung stretch injury with entry of bubbles into the pulmonary venous circulation and subsequently the systemic arterial circulation. We present the case of an individual who suffered AGE while breathing compressed air at 1.2 metres' fresh water (mfw) in a swimming pool and discuss the factors determining the depth at which this form of injury may occur. This case serves to underscore the fact that risk of AGE exists at shallow depths.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957133/,2022-11-28 02:55:23 AM
Hypothesis: the influence of cavitation or vacuum phenomenon for decompression sickness,"Youichi Yanagawa, Kazuhiko Omori, Kouhei Ishikawa, Kei Jitsuiki, Toshihiko Yoshizawa, Ikuto Takeuchi, Hiromichi Ohsaka, Youichi Yanagawa, Kazuhiko Omori, Kouhei Ishikawa, Kei Jitsuiki, Toshihiko Yoshizawa, Ikuto Takeuchi, Hiromichi Ohsaka",2016 Sep,"Attention has recently been focused on the vacuum phenomenon detected by computed tomography (CT), where gas in the human body is incidentally detected by CT. We introduce our hypothesis that the vacuum phenomenon increases the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) in subjects who engage in post-diving exercise. When the screw propeller of a ship operates underwater, a swirling effect called cavitation occurs. This swirling effect is closely related to the ship's propulsive efficiency as well as propeller cracking and damage. Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporization, bubble generation, and bubble implosion that occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. The formation of cavitation depends on the pressure, speed, temperature, viscosity, turbulence, or existence of impurities in the fluid; the evaporation of inert gas; and the form and surface roughness of the screw. These factors also resemble risk factors of DCS. In the human body, the cavitation effect has been recognized in radiological studies, where it is referred to as the 'vacuum phenomenon'. The mechanism responsible for the formation of the vacuum phenomenon has been described recently. If an enclosed tissue space is allowed to expand as a rebound phenomenon after an external impact, the volume within the enclosed space will increase. Under this condition of expanding volume, the pressure within the space will decrease. The solubility of the gas in the enclosed space will then subsequently decrease as the pressure inside the space decreases, allowing a gas such as nitrogen to leave solution. The combination of reduced nitrogen solubility and the minimal metabolism of nitrogen by the body mainly accounts for the formation of the vacuum phenomenon. The vacuum phenomenon has been observed in normal joints, degenerative intervertebral discs, the spine and spinal canal and traumatized tissues (Figure 1). Exercise induces the inflation and deflation of tissue or the extension and flexion of multiple joints. The pressure of the inflated tissue or extended joints decreases based on Henry's Law and Boyle's Law, resulting in cavitation. This phenomenon may be accelerated after diving, during the decompression phase. In an analysis of the effects of the ascent rate and post-dive exercise on the incidence of DCS in rats using ordinal logistic regression, higher rates of DCS and mortality were seen in rats which engaged in post-dive exercise than in control rats. Accordingly, DCS following post-diving exercise may be induced by the vacuum phenomenon, particularly in cases with joint pains. The fact that the vacuum phenomenon is most frequently observed in the spine or spinal disc spaces may also influence the occurrence of spinal cord neurological DCS, which is rarely due to embolization from cardiac origin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723023/,2022-11-28 02:55:24 AM
Flying After Conducting an Aircraft Excessive Cabin Leakage Test,"Stephen Houston, Elizabeth Wilkinson, Stephen Houston, Elizabeth Wilkinson",2016 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      Aviation medical specialists should be aware that commercial airline aircraft engineers may undertake a 'dive equivalent' operation while conducting maintenance activities on the ground. We present a worked example of an occupational risk assessment to determine a minimum safe preflight surface interval (PFSI) for an engineer before flying home to base after conducting an Excessive Cabin Leakage Test (ECLT) on an unserviceable aircraft overseas.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We use published dive tables to determine the minimum safe PFSI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The estimated maximum depth acquired during the procedure varies between 10 and 20 fsw and the typical estimated bottom time varies between 26 and 53 min for the aircraft types operated by the airline. Published dive tables suggest that no minimum PFSI is required for such a dive profile.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Diving tables suggest that no minimum PFSI is required for the typical ECLT dive profile within the airline; however, having conducted a risk assessment, which considered peak altitude exposure during commercial flight, the worst-case scenario test dive profile, the variability of interindividual inert gas retention, and our existing policy among other occupational groups within the airline, we advised that, in the absence of a bespoke assessment of the particular circumstances on the day, the minimum PFSI after conducting ECLT should be 24 h.

      The Republic of China Navy instituted the pressure test as one of the selection tools for diving troops and submarine crews. We analyzed factors associated with failure in the pressure test.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective cohort study designed to investigate pressure test failure in Navy recruits between January 2010 and August 2015. The recruits received pressurization in a hyperbaric chamber to a simulated depth of 112 feet of seawater (fsw) at a rate of 25 fsw/minute. Data describing trainee demographics, disease history, causes and depth of failure, as well as type of injury, were extracted from case notes and facility databases for statistical analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 3,608 trial cohorts, there were 435 failures, with an overall failure rate of 12.06%. About 95% of these failure trials were within a simulated depth of 60 fsw. Fifty-seven (57) failures did not record causes of failure. Among the other 378 failures, the most commonly identified causes were ear barotrauma (365 trials, 96.56%) and sinus barotrauma (10 trials, 2.65%). Statistical analysis revealed that recent upper respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis, and cigarette smoking were all significantly associated with higher incidence of middle ear barotrauma.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results suggest that pressure testing to a depth of 60 fsw is effective in disqualifying personnel entering diving and submarine service. Recent infection of the upper respiratory tract, allergic rhinitis and cigarette smoking are risk factors for middle ear barotrauma, resulting in failure of the pressure test.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29571230/,2022-11-28 02:55:25 AM

Evolutionary impacts of purine metabolism genes on mammalian oxidative stress adaptation,"Ran Tian, Chen Yang, Si-Min Chai, Han Guo, Inge Seim, Guang Yang, Ran Tian, Chen Yang, Si-Min Chai, Han Guo, Inge Seim, Guang Yang",2022 Mar 18,"Many mammals risk damage from oxidative stress stemming from frequent dives (i.e., cycles of ischemia/reperfusion and hypoxia/reoxygenation), high altitude and subterranean environments, or powered flight. Purine metabolism is an essential response to oxidative stress, and an imbalance between purine salvage and de novo biosynthesis pathways can generate damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we examined the evolution of 117 purine metabolism-related genes to explore the accompanying molecular mechanisms of enhanced purine metabolism in mammals under high oxidative stress. We found that positively selected genes, convergent changes, and nonparallel amino acid substitutions are possibly associated with adaptation to oxidative stress in mammals. In particular, the evolution of convergent genes with cAMP and cGMP regulation roles may protect mammals from oxidative damage. Additionally, 32 genes were identified as under positive selection in cetaceans, including key purine salvage enzymes (i.e., HPRT1), suggesting improved re-utilization of non-recyclable purines avoid hypoxanthine accumulation and reduce oxidative stress. Most intriguingly, we found that six unique substitutions in cetacean xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), an enzyme that regulates the generation of the ROS precursor xanthine oxidase (XO) during ischemic/hypoxic conditions, show enhanced enzyme activity and thermal stability and diminished XO conversion activity. These functional adaptations are likely beneficial for cetaceans by reducing radical oxygen species production during diving. In summary, our findings offer insights into the molecular and functional evolution of purine metabolism genes in mammalian oxidative stress adaptations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35194983/,2022-11-28 02:55:26 AM

      A 35-year-old male ascended rapidly using compressed-air diving. Before reaching the coast, he reported dizziness, shortness of breath, and pain in the abdomen and legs. Three hours later, when symptoms worsened, he went to the hospital. He was admitted with increased osteotendinous reflexes and cutis marmorata in the abdomen.

Before completing his treatment at depth, he developed myocardial infarction and died. The death certificate indicated Type I DCS, thrombotic pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Upon reviewing his medical records, we uncovered no evidence to support the diagnosis of CO poisoning and thrombotic pulmonary embolism. The clinical presentation seems to be compatible with a serious decompression insult, not a Type I hit. Based on the information gathered, it seems likely that the patient died as a result of cardiopulmonary DCS. This case report suggests a need to provide fishermen divers in this region with formal dive training. There also seems to be a need to improve medical education for physicians who work at hyperbaric programs, and to ensure that sufficient and qualified staff is present to supervise patients inside the chambers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28779584/,2022-11-28 02:55:28 AM
Incremental Validity of Personality Measures in Predicting Underwater Performance and Adaptation,"Joaquín Colodro, Enrique J Garcés-de-Los-Fayos, Juan J López-García, Lucía Colodro-Conde, Joaquín Colodro, Enrique J Garcés-de-Los-Fayos, Juan J López-García, Lucía Colodro-Conde",2015 Mar 17,"Intelligence and personality traits are currently considered effective predictors of human behavior and job performance. However, there are few studies about their relevance in the underwater environment. Data from a sample of military personnel performing scuba diving courses were analyzed with regression techniques, testing the contribution of individual differences and ascertaining the incremental validity of the personality in an environment with extreme psychophysical demands. The results confirmed the incremental validity of personality traits (ΔR 2 = .20, f 2 = .25) over the predictive contribution of general mental ability (ΔR 2 = .07, f 2 = .08) in divers' performance. Moreover, personality (R(L)2 = .34) also showed a higher validity to predict underwater adaptation than general mental ability ( R(L)2 = .09). The ROC curve indicated 86% of the maximum possible discrimination power for the prediction of underwater adaptation, AUC = .86, p < .001, 95% CI (.82-.90). These findings confirm the shift and reversal of incremental validity of dispositional traits in the underwater environment and the relevance of personality traits as predictors of an effective response to the changing circumstances of military scuba diving. They also may improve the understanding of the behavioral effects and psychophysiological complications of diving and can also provide guidance for psychological intervention and prevention of risk in this extreme environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26055931/,2022-11-28 02:55:28 AM
The healthy diver: A cross-sectional survey to evaluate the health status of recreational scuba diver members of Divers Alert Network (DAN),"Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Kristen L Kucera, Petar J Denoble, Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Kristen L Kucera, Petar J Denoble",2018 Mar 22,"Background:
        
      
      Scuba diver fitness is paramount to confront environmental stressors of diving. However, the diving population is aging and the increasing prevalence of diseases may be a concern for diver fitness.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this study is to assess the demographics, lifestyle factors, disease prevalence, and healthcare access and utilization of Divers Alert Network (DAN) members and compare them with those from the general population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      DAN membership health survey (DMHS) was administered online in 2011 to DAN members in the United States (US). Health status of DMHS respondents was compared with the general US population data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System using two-sided student's t-tests and Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with healthcare utilization among the DMHS participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared to the general US population, the DMHS population had lower prevalence of asthma, heart attack, angina, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and disabilities (p<0.01); more heavy alcohol drinkers, and fewer smokers (p<0.01); and greater access and utilization (routine checkup) of healthcare (p<0.01). Healthcare utilization in males was lower than among females. Increasing age and increase in the number of chronic illnesses were associated with increased healthcare utilization.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      DAN members are healthier than the general US population. DAN members also have better access to healthcare and utilize healthcare for preventive purposes more often than the general population. DAN members appear to have a better fitness level than their non-diving peers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29566018/,2022-11-28 02:55:29 AM
SPECIFICS OF GAS BUBBLE FORMATION AND GROWTH IN TISSUES DURING DECOMPRESSION AFTER SATURATION DIVES,"V P Nikolaev, V N Komarevtsev, V P Nikolaev, V N Komarevtsev",2016,It is shown that the decompression schedule after saturation dives to a depth of 30 m designed to hold the nitrogen supersaturation for the most <<slow>> tissues at the acceptable levels is significantly shorter than the decompression schedules with zero supersaturation. of these tissues with nitrogen and all dissolved gases. Equality of the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) onset under this decompression schedule to the risk of DCS onset under the rapid ascent to the surface after saturation dives to a depth of 6.1 m indicates that the effect of the high ambient pressure decreases the concentration of seeds of gas bubbles in tissues and their subsequent growth rate. The DCS symptoms in experienced divers under dangerous decompression profiles not appear due to the lower concentration of gas bubble seeds in their tissues relatively to the average level inherent to the many of humans.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29873980/,2022-11-28 02:55:30 AM
Observational study of potential risk factors of immersion pulmonary edema in healthy divers: exercise intensity is the main contributor,"A Boussuges, K Ayme, G Chaumet, E Albier, M Borgnetta, O Gavarry, A Boussuges, K Ayme, G Chaumet, E Albier, M Borgnetta, O Gavarry",2017 Oct 3,"Background:
        
      
      The risk factors of pulmonary edema induced by diving in healthy subjects are not well known. The aim of the present study was to assess the parameters contributing to the increase in extravascular lung water after diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was carried out in a professional diving institute. All divers participating in the teaching program from June 2012 to June 2014 were included in the study. Extravascular lung water was assessed using the detection of ultrasound lung comets (ULC) by chest ultrasonography. Clinical parameters and dive profiles were recorded using a questionnaire and a dive computer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One-hundred six divers were investigated after 263 dives. They used an open-circuit umbilical supplying compressed gas diving apparatus in 202 cases and a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus in 61 cases. A generalized linear mixed model analysis was performed which demonstrated that the dive induced a significant increase in ULC score (incidence rate ratio: 3.16). It also identified that the predictive variable of increased extravascular lung water after the dive was the exercise intensity at depth (z = 3.99, p < 0.0001). The other parameters studied such as the water temperature, dive profile, hyperoxic exposure, or anthropometric data were not associated with the increase in extravascular lung water after the dive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study, the exercise intensity was the main contributor to the increase in extravascular lung water in healthy divers. To improve the prevention of immersion pulmonary edema, the exercise intensity experienced during the dive should thus be adapted to the aerobic fitness level of the divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28975560/,2022-11-28 02:57:16 AM
Decrease of tetrahydrobiopterin and NO generation in endothelial cells exposed to simulated diving,"Ronja Hesthammer, Torunn Eide, Einar Thorsen, Asbjørn M Svardal, Rune Djurhuus, Ronja Hesthammer, Torunn Eide, Einar Thorsen, Asbjørn M Svardal, Rune Djurhuus",2019,"Purpose:
        
      
      Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to protect against bubble formation and the risk of decompression sickness. We hypothesize that oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) leads to a decreased production of NO during simulated diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to hyperoxia or simulated diving for 24 hours. The levels of biopterins (BH4, BH2 and B) were determined by LC-MS/MS, and the production of NO by monitoring the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Exposure to hyperoxia decreased BH4 in a dose-dependent manner; by 48 ± 15% following exposure to 40 kPa O2 (P⟨0.001 vs. control at 20 kPa O2), and 70 ± 16% following exposure to 60 kPa O2. Exposure to 40 kPa O2 decreased NO production by 25 ± 9%, but there was no further decrease when increasing oxygen exposure to 60 kPa (25 ± 10%). No additional effects of simulated diving were observed, indicating no additive or synergistic effects of hyperbaria and hyperoxia on the BH4 level or NO generation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      NO generation in intact human endothelial cells was decreased by simulated diving, as well as by hyperoxic exposure, while BH4 levels seem to be affected only by hyperoxia. Hence, the results suggest that BH4 is not the sole determinant of NO generation in HUVEC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051061/,2022-11-28 02:57:16 AM
Epidemiology of sport-related spinal cord injuries: A systematic review,"Christie Wl Chan, Janice J Eng, Charles H Tator, Andrei Krassioukov, Spinal Cord Injury Research Evidence Team, Christie Wl Chan, Janice J Eng, Charles H Tator, Andrei Krassioukov, Spinal Cord Injury Research Evidence Team",2016 May,"Context:
        
      
      Despite the recognition of sports as a significant contributor in the etiology of spinal cord injury (SCI), no studies have systematically explored the epidemiology of SCI caused by sports.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This paper aims to give a systematic overview of the epidemiology of sport-related spinal cord injury around the world.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted to identify published literature reporting the epidemiology of SCI caused by sports. The literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Sportdiscus with date limits 1980 through to July 2015. Data from 54 studies covering 25 countries was extracted and collated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Important findings include identification of 6 countries in which sports accounts for over 13% of SCI (highest to lowest: Russia, Fiji, New Zealand, Iceland, France and Canada); individual sports with high risk for SCI (diving, skiing, rugby, and horseback riding); and the most common level of injury for various sports (almost entirely cervical for hockey, skiing, diving and American football, while over half of horseback riding and snowboarding injuries are thoracic or lumbosacral).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This paper identifies countries and sports with higher rates of sport-related SCIs where implementation of prevention programs and reporting systems to track SCI epidemiology may be helpful, and highlights gaps in our current knowledge for further investigation. The comparison of SCI occurrence for each sport across countries, as well as examination of the specific characteristics of SCI incurred for individual sports will assist in directing efforts for prevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26864974/,2022-11-28 02:57:17 AM

Mortality among professional divers in Norway,"Å Irgens, K Troland, E Thorsen, M Grønning, Å Irgens, K Troland, E Thorsen, M Grønning",2013 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Diving operations are technically complex, and the underwater environment poses a high risk of fatal or near miss accidents. Furthermore, long-term effects of diving on bone, the central nervous system and the lung have been observed in divers who have not experienced any diving-related accidents.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To compare total and cause-specific mortality among Norwegian professional divers by class of diving certificate, relative to the general population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on mortality were obtained for divers in the Norwegian Inshore Diving Registry, which comprises data on all divers with a certificate valid for professional diving after 1980. By August 2010, 5526 male divers born between 1950 and 1990 were identified, 3130 of whom were fully certified professional divers. The rest of the Norwegian male population born in the same period (1 604 147) served as referents. Data on mortality were obtained by linkage to the Cause of Death Registry.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mortality was 23 per 1000 in professional divers and 24 per 1000 in referents. The hazard ratio was 0.79 (confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.997). Diving-related accidents and suicide were the most common causes of death among divers. Both were significantly more common among divers with the higher level diving certificates.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, mortality in professional divers was lower than that of the general population. However, professional divers had a higher risk of dying from work-related accident or suicide.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24192141/,2022-11-28 02:57:18 AM
High-grade patent foramen ovale is a risk factor of unprovoked decompression sickness in recreational divers,"Jakub Honěk, Martin Šrámek, Luděk Šefc, Jaroslav Januška, Jiří Fiedler, Martin Horváth, Aleš Tomek, Štěpán Novotný, Tomáš Honěk, Josef Veselka, Jakub Honěk, Martin Šrámek, Luděk Šefc, Jaroslav Januška, Jiří Fiedler, Martin Horváth, Aleš Tomek, Štěpán Novotný, Tomáš Honěk, Josef Veselka",2019 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      Patent foramen ovale (PFO), male sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) were all identified as potential risk factors of decompression sickness (DCS). It has been debated whether PFO might cause unprovoked DCS (i.e. without violation of decompression procedure) due to paradoxical embolization of venous gas emboli. To date, there are no data on the incidence or risk factors of unprovoked DCS. This study sought to evaluate the risk factors of unprovoked DCS in recreational divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 489 consecutive divers were screened for PFO between January 2006 and January 2014 by means of transcranial Doppler. All patients were prospectively included in the study registry. Survival analysis techniques were used to assess for risk factors for unprovoked DCS. Age, sex, BMI, PFO presence, and grade were analyzed. The total sum of dives was used as a measure of time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The group performed a total of 169,411 dives (mean 346±636). Thirty-six (7%) of the divers suffered from an unprovoked DCS. The frequency of PFO was 97.2% in divers with a history of unprovoked DCS and 35.5% in controls (p<0.001). There was no difference in sex, age, BMI, or total number of dives between the respective groups. In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, PFO grade 3 was a major risk factor for unprovoked DCS; there was a slight protective effect of increasing age.

The aging diver: endothelial biochemistry and its potential implications for cardiovascular health,"Simin Berenji Ardestani, Peter Buzzacott, Ingrid Eftedal, Simin Berenji Ardestani, Peter Buzzacott, Ingrid Eftedal",2015 Dec,"Divers are exposed to circulatory stress that directly affects the endothelial lining of blood vessels, and even asymptomatic dives are associated with inflammatory responses, microparticle release and endothelial dysfunction. As humans age, there is a relative increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, attributed in part to declining endothelial function. Whether extensive diving in the older diver increases the risk of disease as a result of accumulated circulatory stress or provides protection through processes of acclimatization remains an open question. We provide a brief review of current knowledge about the separate effects of diving and aging on the vascular endothelium in humans and rodents, and discuss the available data on their combined effects.

All cases of diving deaths recorded on the coast of Girona (Spain) between January 2009 and May 2018 were analyzed. Most data were obtained from the police technical reports and the forensic pathology service. Each accident was analyzed in order to identify the trigger, disabling agent, disabling injury, and cause of death. During the study period 25 diving-related fatalities were recorded. Most of the victims were males aged 50-69 years, and 11 were experienced divers. Almost all victims were using open-circuit SCUBA to breathe with compressed air as their sole gas supply. None of the victims were diving alone. The most common identified triggers included exertion, panic, buoyancy problems, disorientation and confusion. The main factors identified as disabling agents were rapid ascent, a cardiac incident, panic and entrapment. Asphyxia, lung over expansion, and myocardial ischemia were the most frequent disabling injuries. Finally, drowning represented the main cause of death, followed by arterial gas embolism and natural causes or internal diseases. A differential diagnosis, performed in the setting of a multidisciplinary investigation, is essential for elucidating the cause of death in diving-related fatalities.

Asthma is a common disease with a similar prevalence in divers as in the general population. Due to theoretical concern about an increased risk for pulmonary barotrauma and decompression sickness in asthmatic divers, in the past the approach to asthmatic diver candidates was very conservative, with scuba disallowed.

Influence of wearing a scuba diving mouthpiece on the stomatognathic system - considerations for mouthpiece design,"Toshiaki Hirose, Takahiro Ono, Yoshinobu Maeda, Toshiaki Hirose, Takahiro Ono, Yoshinobu Maeda",2016 Jun,"Although diver's mouth syndrome (DMS) has long been recognized by scuba divers, little attention has been paid to the influence of wearing a scuba diving mouthpiece on the stomatognathic system. In this review, DMS-related stomatognathic events (DMS-SE) while wearing a mouthpiece, the relationship between components of the mouthpiece and those events, and design considerations to reduce the risk of those events are discussed based on evidence from 32 articles concerning scuba diving mouthpieces. Forward movement of the mandible, loss of molar occlusal support, and continuous jaw clenching while wearing a mouthpiece are considered to be pathogenic for DMS-SE. Several experimental studies have suggested a relationship between incidence of those events and the design of mouthpiece components such as the connector, labial flange, platform, and occlusal rug, and the possibility of reducing risk of those events through design customization of these components. Improvement of the shape of commercially available mouthpieces and creation of custom-made mouthpieces may thus contribute to the prevention and treatment of DMS-SE and the provision of a comfortable diving environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26486490/,2022-11-28 02:59:53 AM
[Hyperbaric therapy and diving medicine - diving medicine - present state and prospects],"Bernd Winkler, Claus-Martin Muth, Tim Piepho, Bernd Winkler, Claus-Martin Muth, Tim Piepho",2015 Oct,"The diving accident (decompression incident, DCI) occurs in the decompression phase of dives. The DCI can either be caused by an arterial gas embolism (AGE) subsequent to a pulmonary barotrauma or by the formation of inert gas bubbles subsequent to a reduction of ambient pressure during the ascent from depth. In contrast to the traditional assumption that decompression incidents only occur if decompression rules are neglected, recent data indicate that a vast amount of diving accidents occur even though divers adhered to the rules. Hence, there is a large inter- and intraindividual variability in the predisposition for diving accidents. Within the past few years, the molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of diving accidents has improved considerably. It is now well accepted that pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulatory mechanisms play a central role. Moreover, microparticles are increasingly discussed in the pathogenesis of diving accidents. These new molecular findings have not yet resulted in new therapeutic approaches. However, new approaches of preconditioning before the dive have been developed which are intended to reduce the risk of diving accidents. The symptoms of a diving accident show a large variability and range. They reach from pruritus over tension in the female breast, marbled skin and pain in the joints to severe neurological disability like paraplegia or hemiplegia. Furthermore, pulmonary symptoms can be a result of a pulmonary gas embolism and/or a tension pneumothorax. Extreme cases can also manifest as generalized, difficult-to-treat seizures, loss of consciousness or even death. The evidence-based therapy of diving accidents consists of an immediate application of 100% inspiratory O2. This can be performed via a demand valve, face mask with reservoir bag or ventilation bag connected to a reservoir bag. Fluid substitution is performed by i. v. infusion of 500-1000ml/h of cristalloids. If consciousness is not impaired, the diver is positioned in a supine position, in case of impaired or absent consciousness in a lateral recovery position. Especially in severe cases of DCI a fast transfer to a qualified hyperbaric center and the earliest possible hyperbaric O2-therapy is essential.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510109/,2022-11-28 02:59:53 AM

"Scuba diving fatalities in Australia, 2001 to 2013: Diver demographics and characteristics","John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study identified characteristics of victims of fatal scuba diving incidents to determine contributing factors and inform appropriate countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was searched to identify scuba diving deaths for 2001-2013, inclusive. Data were extracted from witness and police reports, medical histories and autopsies. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse these data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 scuba diving-related fatalities identified during the study period. The mean age was 44 years, 99 (79%) victims were male and 83 (77%) were either overweight or obese. Most deaths occurred in New South Wales and Queensland, often in a commercial setting. Twenty-three (79%) Queensland victims were overseas tourists. At least 52 (41%) were novices and 17 (13%) died during training or an introductory scuba experience. Only 35 (28%) were with a buddy when the incident occurred and at least 81 (64%) were still wearing weights when recovered.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The age of these victims may reflect an older cohort of participants and the associated higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions. The high prevalence of obesity suggests that this may be a risk factor. The high proportion of deaths in overseas tourists highlights an on-going need for appropriate screening and monitoring in what may be a higher risk cohort. The number of deaths that occurred under instruction highlights the importance of careful assessment of the site, prevailing conditions, an appropriate instructor-student ratio and close supervision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557411/,2022-11-28 02:59:55 AM
Catching Air: Risk and Embodied Ocean Health among Dominican Diver Fishermen,"Kyrstin Mallon Andrews, Kyrstin Mallon Andrews",2021 Mar,"This article explores the connections between bodily health and environmental health among diver fishermen in the Dominican Republic, and how these relationships are excluded from broader conversations about marine conservation at the national and global levels. As changing ocean environments refigure marine ecosystems, making fish scarce in the shallows, diver fishermen must dive deeper and stay longer in risky conditions, using a compressor to pump an unlimited supply of air to the diver below. As a result, decompression sickness (the bends) has become a pervasive injury and a way that coastal communities experience changing ocean health. The article analyzes injury narratives from divers who ""caught air,"" the local term for the bends, arguing that decompression sickness is a symptom of failing ecologies and strained human relations with the sea, where environments at risk become embodied through parallel risky practices at sea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521085/,2022-11-28 02:59:55 AM
Sinus barotrauma in diving,"Oskari H Lindfors, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Jari Suvilehto, Saku T Sinkkonen, Oskari H Lindfors, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Jari Suvilehto, Saku T Sinkkonen",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Sinus barotrauma is a common occurrence in diving and subaquatic medicine, potentially compromising dive safety. To gain a more thorough understanding of the condition, an in-depth investigation is justified.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a survey study. An anonymous, electronic questionnaire was distributed to 7,060 recipients: professional divers of the Finnish Border Guard, the Finnish Rescue Services, and the Finnish Heritage agency, as well as recreational divers registered as members of the Finnish Divers' Association reachable by email (roughly two-thirds of all members and recreational divers in Finland). Primary outcomes were self-reported prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health effects of sinus barotrauma while diving. Secondary outcomes were adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of sinus barotrauma with respect to possible risk factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 1,881 respondents participated in the study (response rate 27%). A total of 49% of the respondents had experienced sinus barotrauma while diving and of those affected, 32% had used medications to alleviate their symptoms. The factors associated with sinus barotrauma were pollen allergies (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.10-2.29), regular smoking (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.07-3.91) and a high number of upper respiratory tract infections per year (≥ 3 vs. < 3 infections per year: OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.79-4.24).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Sinus barotrauma is the second most common condition encountered in diving medicine, having affected 49% of the respondents. Possible risk factors include allergies to pollen, regular smoking, and a high number of URTIs per year.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157734/,2022-11-28 02:59:57 AM

Influence of repeated daily diving on decompression stress,"J Zanchi, M Ljubkovic, P J Denoble, Z Dujic, S Ranapurwala, N W Pollock, J Zanchi, M Ljubkovic, P J Denoble, Z Dujic, S Ranapurwala, N W Pollock",2014 Jun,"Acclimatization (an adaptive change in response to repeated environmental exposure) to diving could reduce decompression stress. A decrease in post-dive circulating venous gas emboli (VGE or bubbles) would represent positive acclimatization. The purpose of this study was to determine whether four days of daily diving alter post-dive bubble grades. 16 male divers performed identical no-decompression air dives on 4 consecutive days to 18 meters of sea water for 47 min bottom times. VGE monitoring was performed with transthoracic echocardiography every 20 min for 120 min post-dive. Completion of identical daily dives resulted in progressively decreasing odds (or logit risk) of having relatively higher grade bubbles on consecutive days. The odds on Day 4 were half that of Day 1 (OR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.73). The odds ratio for a >III bubble grade on Day 4 was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.70) when compared to Day 1. The current study indicates that repetitive daily diving may reduce bubble formation, representing a positive (protective) acclimatization to diving.

Western Australia coastal shark bites: A risk assessment,"Peter Sprivulis, Peter Sprivulis",2014 Feb 28,"Background:
        
      
      As Western Australia's (WA) government enacts shark bite mitigation, the personal risk of shark bite in WA has not been studied.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      Model the risk of large (>3m) white shark bite (Carcharodon carcharias, LWS) in southwest WA.
    


          Method:
        
      
      An observational study inclusive of 1 January 1974 to 31 December 2013 was conducted. Analysis of prey abundance, location, water temperature, and water activity participation. Shark bite risk was benchmarked against serious or fatal recreational cycling crash risk in WA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Total and fatal shark bites have grown exponentially over 40 years (3 to 29 total, 0 to 7 fatal per 5 years), correlated with the 10 per cent annual growth in WA humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) abundance (rtotal=0.96 95%CI 0.77-0.99, p<0.001; rfatal=0.96 95%CI 0.81-0.99, p<0.001) but not water activity participation rtotal= 0.25, 95%CI -0.45-0.76, p=0.48). LWS were implicated in 10 of 12 fatalities. Metropolitan Perth beach summer/autumn bathing less than 25m from shore in water less than 5m deep (risk lower than 1 in 20 years) is estimated to be at least 50x safer than cycling. Off-shore diving and surf sports off Perth, during winter/spring have a similar risk to cycling. Winter/spring off- shore diving south of Perth has between 3 and 11 times the cycling risk.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      WA's shark bite risk is likely to increase as whale abundance continues to increase off the WA coast. However, the risk to bathers less than 25m from shore in shallow water during the WA summer, is likely to remain very low, and well below the risk of other recreational activities undertaken in WA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24611078/,2022-11-28 02:59:59 AM

Diving ergospirometry with suspended weights: breathing- and fin-swimming style matter,"Andreas Koch, Dennis Kramkowski, Mattes Holzum, Wataru Kähler, Sebastian Klapa, Bente Rieger, Burkhard Weisser, Jochen D Schipke, Andreas Koch, Dennis Kramkowski, Mattes Holzum, Wataru Kähler, Sebastian Klapa, Bente Rieger, Burkhard Weisser, Jochen D Schipke",2022 Nov,"Purpose:
        
      
      Scuba diving is a complex condition including elevated ambient pressure, limited air supply, increased breathing work, and unfamiliar fin-swimming. Earlier approaches to assess diving specific data did not comprehensively address these aspects. We first present an underwater ergospirometry system and then test the hypothesis that both breathing characteristics and fin-swimming style affect the air consumption.
    


          Methods/participants:
        
      
      A suspended-weights ergospirometry system was mounted inside a hyperbaric chamber. Ergo group: 25 divers (24.6 ± 4.1 years); three set-ups: dry normobaric cycling (75-225 W), dry cycling at 20 m simulated depth (75-225 W), fin-swimming at 20 m (5-8 kg suspended weights). Style group: 20 other divers (24.6 ± 4.1 years): fin-swimming at 20 m (5-8 kg) with regard to ventilation ([Formula: see text]E) and fin-swimming style.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ergo group: linear heart rate and oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]O2) increases with both 50 W-bicycle steps and suspended-weights ergometry (r = 0.97). During hyperbaric conditions, [Formula: see text]E was less increased versus normobaric conditions. Style group: the more efficient hip/thigh-oriented style shifted towards the knee/calf-oriented style. [Formula: see text]E and [Formula: see text]O2 were higher in beginners (< 100 dives) versus advanced divers (≥ 100 dives). Significant differences on the 5 kg-step: [Formula: see text]E: 31.5 ± 7.1 l/min vs. 23.7 ± 5.9 l/min and [Formula: see text]O2: 1.6 ± 0.3 l/min vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 l/min. A comparison is presented, in addition to illustrate the impact of differences in breathing characteristics and fin-swimming style.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Diving ergospirometry with suspended weights in a hyperbaric chamber allows for comprehensive studies.

The impact of repetitive hyperbaric exposure during SCUBA diving on cochlear implants,"Justin M Hintze, Lina Geyer, Conall W Fitzgerald, Cristina Simoes Franklin, Fergal Glynn, Laura Viani, Peter Walshe, Justin M Hintze, Lina Geyer, Conall W Fitzgerald, Cristina Simoes Franklin, Fergal Glynn, Laura Viani, Peter Walshe",2019 Dec,"Objectives/hypothesis:
        
      
      Complications during or after cochlear implantation are relatively rare. They occur more frequently in patients who partake in activities that can potentially lead to local trauma. No formal recommendations exist for participation in self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) activities. We describe three patients with a combined five cochlear implants and extensive diving experience, the largest case series to date, and highlight some of the difficulties faced. We also review the literature on previously described SCUBA-diving patients with cochlear implants.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Retrospective case series and literature review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review of the known SCUBA divers in the National Hearing Implant and Research Centre in Ireland was conducted, and a review of the literature was carried out using PubMed and Google Scholar.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the three SCUBA divers with cochlear implants, two required reimplantation, the first due to nonauditory stimulation, and the second due to extrusion of the electrode through the tympanic membrane following repetitive SCUBA dives. The third patient remains without complications after 80 dives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with cochlear implants can have complications relating to the implant itself, with device failure a theoretical risk. The cochleostomy can lead to perilymphatic extravasation, as well as inner ear barotrauma, decompression sickness, and formation of air bubbles along the electrode. A combination of deafness, vestibulopathy with abrupt perilymph leak, and loss of proprioception can lead to disorientation and blue dome syndrome. Based on our experience with cochlear implants in SCUBA divers, along with those reported in the literature, we recommend caution in patients with cochlear implants who SCUBA dive regularly and strict adherence to the recommended safety limits.

Board Diving Regulations in Public Swimming Pools and Risk of Injury,"David Williams, Louise Odin, David Williams, Louise Odin",2016 Jun,"Public session access to diving boards is one of the stepping stones for those wishing to develop their skills in the sport of diving. The extent to which certain dive forms are considered risky (forward/backward/rotations) and therefore not permitted is a matter for local pool managers. In Study 1, 20 public pools with diving facilities responded to a U.K. survey concerning their diving regulation policy and related injury incidence in the previous year. More restrictive regulation of dive forms was not associated with a decrease in injuries (rs [42] = -0.20, p = 0.93). In Study 2, diving risk perception and attitudes towards regulation were compared between experienced club divers (N = 22) and nondivers (N = 22). Risk was perceived to be lower for those with experience, and these people favored less regulation. The findings are interpreted in terms of a risk thermostat model, where for complex physical performance activities such as diving, individuals may exercise caution in proportion to their ability and previous experience of success and failure related to the activity. Though intuitively appealing, restrictive regulation of public pool diving may be ineffective in practice because risk is not simplistically associated with dive forms, and divers are able to respond flexibly to risk by exercising caution where appropriate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26574715/,2022-11-28 03:00:02 AM
Effects of Cold Decompression on Hemodynamic Function and Decompression Sickness Risk in a Dry Diving Rat Model,"Svein E Gaustad, Timofei V Kondratiev, Ingrid Eftedal, Torkjel Tveita, Svein E Gaustad, Timofei V Kondratiev, Ingrid Eftedal, Torkjel Tveita",2021 Nov 3,"Background: Diving in cold water is thought to increase the risk of decompression sickness (DCS), especially if the diver is cold during decompression. In this study, we investigated hemodynamic function and DCS risk in an animal model, where cold decompression was followed by rewarming at the surface. Methods: Nine female Sprague Dawley rats had pressure-volume catheters inserted into their left heart ventricle and femoral artery before they were exposed to dry air dives in which their core temperature was normothermic during the bottom phase, cold (35°C) during decompression, and normothermic after the dive. Data from an earlier study were used as controls. The rats were compressed in air to 600kPa, maintained at pressure for 45min, and decompressed at 50kPa/min. Hemodynamic data were recorded before, during, and 60min after decompression. Venous gas bubbles were recorded in the right heart ventricle and pulmonary artery for 60min after the dive. Results and Conclusion: During decompression, cardiac output (CO), and stroke volume (SV) decreased equally in cold rats and controls. CO and SV were temporarily re-established at the surface, before falling again in the cold rats. There was no difference in post-dive venous bubble grades. However, as the post-dive fall in CO and SV could be a sign of gas emboli obstructing the pulmonary circulation, we cannot conclude whether the DCS risk was increased.

It is not unusual for travelers to engage in extreme sports far off the beaten path, in destinations where environmental conditions are difficult and specialist healthcare is not easily available. Therefore, before taking the decision to engage in any form of adventurous activity, travelers should be encouraged to take certain precautionary measures. The most important are: identification of potential health risk factors related to travel or the activity itself, physical conditioning and fitness training prior to travel (depending on the type of activity) and prophylaxis (a travel health kit, mandatory and recommended vaccinations, a pre-travel consultation to assess a person's fitness to travel and identify any potential contraindications for certain types of adventure sports, a comprehensive travel insurance policy).

Saturation diving; physiology and pathophysiology,"Alf O Brubakk, John A S Ross, Stephen R Thom, Alf O Brubakk, John A S Ross, Stephen R Thom",2014 Jul,"In saturation diving, divers stay under pressure until most of their tissues are saturated with breathing gas. Divers spend a long time in isolation exposed to increased partial pressure of oxygen, potentially toxic gases, bacteria, and bubble formation during decompression combined with shift work and long periods of relative inactivity. Hyperoxia may lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that interact with cell structures, causing damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid. Vascular gas-bubble formation and hyperoxia may lead to dysfunction of the endothelium. The antioxidant status of the diver is an important mechanism in the protection against injury and is influenced both by diet and genetic factors. The factors mentioned above may lead to production of heat shock proteins (HSP) that also may have a negative effect on endothelial function. On the other hand, there is a great deal of evidence that HSPs may also have a ""conditioning"" effect, thus protecting against injury. As people age, their ability to produce antioxidants decreases. We do not currently know the capacity for antioxidant defense, but it is reasonable to assume that it has a limit. Many studies have linked ROS to disease states such as cancer, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and atherosclerosis as well as to old age. However, ROS are also involved in a number of protective mechanisms, for instance immune defense, antibacterial action, vascular tone, and signal transduction. Low-grade oxidative stress can increase antioxidant production. While under pressure, divers change depth frequently. After such changes and at the end of the dive, divers must follow procedures to decompress safely. Decompression sickness (DCS) used to be one of the major causes of injury in saturation diving. Improved decompression procedures have significantly reduced the number of reported incidents; however, data indicate considerable underreporting of injuries. Furthermore, divers who are required to return to the surface quickly are under higher risk of serious injury as no adequate decompression procedures for such situations are available. Decompression also leads to the production of endothelial microparticles that may reduce endothelial function. As good endothelial function is a documented indicator of health that can be influenced by regular exercise, regular physical exercise is recommended for saturation divers. Nowadays, saturation diving is a reasonably safe and well controlled method for working under water. Until now, no long-term impact on health due to diving has been documented. However, we still have limited knowledge about the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved. In particular we know little about the effect of long exposure to hyperoxia and microparticles on the endothelium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24944036/,2022-11-28 03:00:04 AM

In both cases, the cause of death was attributable to arterial gas embolism, resulting from pulmonary barotrauma subsequent to pulmonary over-distension. The dive computer analysis and the tank manometer allowed us to understand what happened underwater. In our opinion, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial in order to clarify the cause of death.

Improving estimates of diving lung volume in air-breathing marine vertebrates,"Andreas Fahlman, Katsufumi Sato, Patrick Miller, Andreas Fahlman, Katsufumi Sato, Patrick Miller",2020 Jun 25,"The air volume in the respiratory system of marine tetrapods provides a store of O2 to fuel aerobic metabolism during dives; however, it can also be a liability, as the associated N2 can increase the risk of decompression sickness. In order to more fully understand the physiological limitations of different air-breathing marine vertebrates, it is therefore important to be able to accurately estimate the air volume in the respiratory system during diving. One method that has been used to do so is to calculate the air volume from glide phases - periods of movement during which no thrust is produced by the animal - which many species conduct during ascent periods, when gases are expanding owing to decreasing hydrostatic pressure. This method assumes that there is conservation of mass in the respiratory system, with volume changes only driven by pressure. In this Commentary, we use previously published data to argue that both the respiratory quotient and differences in tissue and blood gas solubility potentially alter the mass balance in the respiratory system throughout a dive. Therefore, near the end of a dive, the measured volume of gas at a given pressure may be 12-50% less than from the start of the dive; the actual difference will depend on the length of the dive, the cardiac output, the pulmonary shunt and the metabolic rate. Novel methods and improved understanding of diving physiology will be required to verify the size of the effects described here and to more accurately estimate the volume of gas inhaled at the start of a dive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32587107/,2022-11-28 03:00:06 AM
Dysbaric osteonecrosis in technical divers: The new 'at-risk' group?,"Brendan Coleman, F Michael Davis, Brendan Coleman, F Michael Davis",2020 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON) in people working under increased atmospheric pressure is well documented. It is generally less common in military and commercial divers than in caisson workers, except in some high-risk groups, such as in many indigenous diving industries where workers have little or no understanding of decompression principles. With the increasing popularity within the recreational diving community of deep air and mixed-gas decompression diving ('technical diving'), it is likely that diving physicians may see an increase in the prevalence of DON in this group in the future.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The case report is presented of a technical diving instructor, with a 30-year history of deep diving, who developed bilateral humeral head DON and required a right shoulder hemi-arthroplasty. A focused literature search was also undertaken to identify published cases of DON in recreational divers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The frequency, duration and depth of exposure to pressure, inadequate decompression, the occurrence of DCS and increasing age have been common features associated with DON in both divers and caisson workers. Many of these features were present in this technical diver.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Whilst DON is uncommon in recreational air scuba divers, all the above risk factors are present to a greater degree in technical diving. It is suggested that medical review for DON is merited from time to time in this potentially high-risk group of recreational divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957134/,2022-11-28 03:00:06 AM

Exposure to a PO2 above 1.4 ATA can cause CNS toxicity, leading to a wide range of neurologic complaints including convulsions. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity develops over time when exposed to a PO2 above 0.5 ATA and can lead to inflammation and fibrosis of lung tissue.

      We conducted a review of PubMed and Cochrane databases to determine rates of neurologic adverse effects or other effects from antimalarials that may be a problem in the diving environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One case report was found on diving and mefloquine. Multiple case reports and clinical trials were found describing neurologic adverse effects of the major chemoprophylactic medications atovaquone/proguanil, chloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, and primaquine.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Of the available literature, atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline are most likely the safest agents and should be preferred; atovaquone/proguanil is superior due to reduced rates of sunburn in the marine environment. Primaquine also appears to be safe, but has reduced efficacy against P. falciparum; mefloquine possesses the highest rate of neurologic side effects and therefore these agents should be limited to extreme cases of patients intolerant to other agents. Chloroquine appears unsafe in the hyperbaric environment and should be avoided. More studies are required to include database reviews of returned divers traveling to malaria endemic areas and randomized controlled trials in the hyperbaric environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28883967/,2022-11-28 03:00:09 AM
Middle ear barotrauma in diving,"Oskari H Lindfors, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Jari Suvilehto, Saku T Sinkkonen, Oskari H Lindfors, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Jari Suvilehto, Saku T Sinkkonen",2021 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Middle ear barotrauma (MEBt) is the most common medical complication in diving, posing a serious risk to dive safety. Given this prevalence and the continuing growth of the diving industry, a comprehensive overview of the condition is warranted.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a survey study. An anonymous, electronic questionnaire was distributed to 7,060 recipients: professional divers of the Finnish Border Guard, the Finnish Rescue Services, and the Finnish Heritage agency; and recreational divers registered as members of the Finnish Divers' Association reachable by e-mail (roughly two-thirds of all members and recreational divers in Finland). Primary outcomes were self-reported prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health effects of MEBt while diving. Secondary outcomes were adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of MEBt with respect to possible risk factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,881 respondents participated in the study (response rate 27%). In total, 81% of the respondents had experienced MEBt while diving. Of those affected, 38% had used medications and 1% had undergone otorhinolaryngology-related surgical procedures due to MEBt. Factors most associated with MEBt were poor subjective success in Valsalva ('occasionally' versus 'always' successful: OR 11.56; 95% CI 7.24-18.47) and Toynbee ('occasionally' versus 'always' successful: OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.95-6.30) manoeuvres.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      MEBt is common in both recreational and professional divers, having affected 81% of the respondents. The main possible risk factors include poor success in pressure equalisation manoeuvres.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761540/,2022-11-28 03:00:10 AM
Are recreational SCUBA divers with asthma at increased risk?,"Amalie S Ustrup, Charlotte S Ulrik, Amalie S Ustrup, Charlotte S Ulrik",2017 Oct,"Background and objective:
        
      
      Asthma has traditionally been regarded as a contraindication to self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving, although large numbers of patients with asthma dive. The aim of the review is to provide an update on current knowledge on potential disease-related hazards in SCUBA divers with asthma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seven studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review (comprising a total of 560 subjects). Five studies reported an increased risk for developing diving-related injuries in divers with asthma, based on case reports (n = 1), case history combined with objective assessment (n = 1), and dives and/or simulated dives (n = 3). The remaining studies (n = 2) were based on self-reported diving habits in divers suffering from asthma, obtained from anonymous questionnaires in diving magazines, reported no diving-related injuries among respondents.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw valid conclusions, but there are indications that recreational divers with asthma may be at increased risk for diving-related injuries compared to non-asthmatic divers. However, it is of at most importance to obtain further evidence from large-scale, well-designed studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27905823/,2022-11-28 03:00:11 AM
Barotrauma with extreme pressures in sport: from scuba to skydiving,"James H Lynch, Travis G Deaton, James H Lynch, Travis G Deaton",2014 Mar-Apr,"The human body is well adapted to dealing with small variations in atmospheric pressure. However when our pursuit of sport and recreation takes us to extreme altitudes or ocean depths, the change in surrounding pressure has the potential to cause significant morbidity. Sports with more extreme changes in atmospheric pressure such as skydiving and scuba diving commonly place the athlete at risk for barotrauma injuries, especially in the middle ear and sinuses. Middle ear barotrauma occurs when a pressure differential develops between the middle ear and the pressure outside of the tympanic membrane. Early symptoms include ear pain, dizziness, and muffled hearing. When extreme pressure gradients are not relieved, middle ear effusions and rupture of the tympanic membrane can occur. A similar mechanism and injury pattern occurs in the sinuses as well. With proper training and prevention strategies, athletes in these sports can protect themselves from most barotrauma injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24614424/,2022-11-28 03:00:11 AM
"Scuba diving-related fatalities in New Zealand, 2007 to 2016","John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Michael Davis, John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Michael Davis",2021 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      New Zealand (NZ) diving-related fatalities have been reported since the 1960s. The aim is to identify contributing risk factors, including medical, and to inform appropriate preventative strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      NZ scuba diving fatalities from 2007 to 2016 were searched from multiple sources - the National Coronial Information System (NCIS); the NZ Chief Coroner's office; Water Safety NZ Drownbase™ and the NZ Police National Dive Squad records. For inclusion, a victim must have been wearing a scuba set (which may include a rebreather). A key word search of the NCIS was made and the results matched to the other databases. An Excel® database was created and a chain of events analysis (CEA) conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-eight scuba diving fatalities were identified, 40 men and eight women, average age 47 years (range 17-68), 20 of Māori ethnicity. Thirty-five were classified as overweight (14) or obese (21). Pre-existing medical risk factors were identified, either pre dive or at autopsy, in 37 divers, the commonest being ischaemic heart disease (IHD, 20), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, 18) and hypertension (seven). IHD, LVH and obesity were variously associated with each other. The likely commonest disabling conditions, identified in 32 cases, were asphyxia (15), cardiac (nine) and pulmonary barotrauma/cerebral arterial gas embolism (five). Multiple environmental and diving practice breaches and poor planning were identified in the CEA, similar to those seen in other studies. Thirty-eight divers had not released their weight belt. Information on resuscitation was limited.
    


          Conclusions:

Danish diving-related fatalities 1999-2012,"Julie Vinkel, Peter Bak, Ole Hyldegaard, Julie Vinkel, Peter Bak, Ole Hyldegaard",2016 Sep,"Aim:
        
      
      The purpose was to explore causative tendencies among diving fatalities to prevent similar injuries in the future.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We report 33 fatal diving injuries that occurred among Danish divers during the period 1999-2012 in Scandinavian waters. The study was performed as a retrospective overview. The empiric data consists of police reports, forensic autopsy reports and examination of the diving equipment. Data were assembled and analyzed using Pivot and Excel. Frequencies and means (± SD) were used to describe categorical and continuous variables respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean age was 38.9 years and drowning was considered the cause of death in 24 of 28 divers for whom a diagnosis was possible. Elevated body mass index (18 of 22 divers had a BMI 〉 25) was overrepresented in our group compared to the background population. A drysuit was worn by 17 divers. Diving independently of a dive centre and mishandling of buoyancy aids were common risk factors. Only two divers released their weights. Three-quarters of those who did not would have increased their chance of survival by doing so; nevertheless, in a quarter of cases the weights were not readily releasable or not releasable at all.
    


          Conclusion:

Heart rate regulation in diving sea lions: the vagus nerve rules,"Paul J Ponganis, Birgitte I McDonald, Michael S Tift, Cassondra L Williams, Paul J Ponganis, Birgitte I McDonald, Michael S Tift, Cassondra L Williams",2017 Apr 15,"Recent publications have emphasized the potential generation of morbid cardiac arrhythmias secondary to autonomic conflict in diving marine mammals. Such conflict, as typified by cardiovascular responses to cold water immersion in humans, has been proposed to result from exercise-related activation of cardiac sympathetic fibers to increase heart rate, combined with depth-related changes in parasympathetic tone to decrease heart rate. After reviewing the marine mammal literature and evaluating heart rate profiles of diving California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), we present an alternative interpretation of heart rate regulation that de-emphasizes the concept of autonomic conflict and the risk of morbid arrhythmias in marine mammals. We hypothesize that: (1) both the sympathetic cardiac accelerator fibers and the peripheral sympathetic vasomotor fibers are activated during dives even without exercise, and their activities are elevated at the lowest heart rates in a dive when vasoconstriction is maximal, (2) in diving animals, parasympathetic cardiac tone via the vagus nerve dominates over sympathetic cardiac tone during all phases of the dive, thus producing the bradycardia, (3) adjustment in vagal activity, which may be affected by many inputs, including exercise, is the primary regulator of heart rate and heart rate fluctuations during diving, and (4) heart beat fluctuations (benign arrhythmias) are common in marine mammals. Consistent with the literature and with these hypotheses, we believe that the generation of morbid arrhythmias because of exercise or stress during dives is unlikely in marine mammals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28424310/,2022-11-28 03:00:15 AM

      Adult prediction rules for cervical spine injury (CSI) exist; however, pediatric rules do not. Our objectives were to determine test accuracies of retrospectively identified CSI risk factors in a prospective pediatric cohort and compare them to a de novo risk model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a 4-center, prospective observational study of children 0 to 17 years old who experienced blunt trauma and underwent emergency medical services scene response, trauma evaluation, and/or cervical imaging. Emergency department providers recorded CSI risk factors. CSIs were classified by reviewing imaging, consultations, and/or telephone follow-up. We calculated bivariable relative risks, multivariable odds ratios, and test characteristics for the retrospective risk model and a de novo model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 4091 enrolled children, 74 (1.8%) had CSIs. Fourteen factors had bivariable associations with CSIs: diving, axial load, clotheslining, loss of consciousness, neck pain, inability to move neck, altered mental status, signs of basilar skull fracture, torso injury, thoracic injury, intubation, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, and neurologic deficits. The retrospective model (high-risk motor vehicle crash, diving, predisposing condition, neck pain, decreased neck mobility (report or exam), altered mental status, neurologic deficits, or torso injury) was 90.5% (95% confidence interval: 83.9%-97.2%) sensitive and 45.6% (44.0%-47.1%) specific for CSIs. The de novo model (diving, axial load, neck pain, inability to move neck, altered mental status, intubation, or respiratory distress) was 92.0% (85.7%-98.1%) sensitive and 50.3% (48.7%-51.8%) specific.

Does persistent (patent) foramen ovale closure reduce the risk of recurrent decompression sickness in scuba divers?,"Björn Edvinsson, Ulf Thilén, Niels Erik Nielsen, Christina Christersson, Mikael Dellborg, Peter Eriksson, Joanna Hlebowicz, Björn Edvinsson, Ulf Thilén, Niels Erik Nielsen, Christina Christersson, Mikael Dellborg, Peter Eriksson, Joanna Hlebowicz",2021 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Interatrial communication is associated with an increased risk of decompression sickness (DCS) in scuba diving. It has been proposed that there would be a decreased risk of DCS after closure of the interatrial communication, i.e., persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO). However, the clinical evidence supporting this is limited.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medical records were reviewed to identify Swedish scuba divers with a history of DCS and catheter closure of an interatrial communication. Thereafter, phone interviews were conducted with questions regarding diving and DCS. All Swedish divers who had had catheter-based PFO-closure because of DCS were followed up, assessing post-closure diving habits and recurrent DCS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine divers, all with a PFO, were included. Eight were diving post-closure. These divers had performed 6,835 dives (median 410, range 140-2,200) before closure, and 4,708 dives (median 413, range 11-2,000) after closure. Seven cases with mild and 10 with serious DCS symptoms were reported before the PFO closure. One diver with a small residual shunt suffered serious DCS post-closure; however, that dive was performed with a provocative diving profile.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Divers with PFO and DCS continue to dive after PFO closure and this seems to be fairly safe. Our study suggests a conservative diving profile when there is a residual shunt after PFO closure, to prevent recurrent DCS events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761542/,2022-11-28 03:00:17 AM
Calculated risk of pulmonary and central nervous system oxygen toxicity: a toxicity index derived from the power equation,"Ran Arieli, Ran Arieli",2019 Sep 30,"Background:
        
      
      The risk of oxygen toxicity has become a prominent issue due to the increasingly widespread administration of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy, as well as the expansion of diving techniques to include oxygen-enriched gas mixtures and technical diving. However, current methods used to calculate the cumulative risk of oxygen toxicity during an HBO exposure i.e., the unit pulmonary toxic dose concept, and the safe boundaries for central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT), are based on a simple linear relationship with an inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and are not supported by recent data.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The power equation: Toxicity Index = t2 × PO2c, where t represents time and c represents the power term, was derived from the chemical reactions producing reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The toxicity index was shown to have a good predictive capability using PO2 with a power c of 6.8 for CNS-OT and 4.57 for pulmonary oxygen toxicity. The pulmonary oxygen toxicity index (PO2 in atmospheres absolute, time in h) should not exceed 250. The CNS-OT index (PO2 in atmospheres absolute, time in min) should not exceed 26,108 for a 1% risk.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The limited use of this toxicity index in the diving community, after more than a decade since its publication in the literature, establishes the need for a handy, user-friendly implementation of the power equation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31523789/,2022-11-28 03:00:18 AM
Diving Mask Squeeze,"John C. Bowman, William Gossman, John C. Bowman, William Gossman",,"Mask squeeze is a type of facial barotrauma injury that occurs most commonly while self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving or freediving. This condition occurs when divers fail to equalize pressure in the face mask to the surrounding water pressure as they descend. The result is a negative pressure (relative to the surrounding water pressure). The difference in pressure inside and outside the mask can lead to injury of blood vessels and tissue of the eyes and tissue covered by the mask, including forehead, nasal areas, and periorbital regions. The main risk factor for a mask squeeze is the inexperience of the diver. Masks with high internal volume or the use of snorkeling masks or swim masks that do not cover the nose can also increase the risk of this type of injury. Recent eye surgery or preexisting glaucoma may increase the risk of injury as well.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31424808/,2022-11-28 03:00:18 AM
Diving with pre-existing medical conditions,"John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Jo Williams, Simon J Mitchell, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Jo Williams, Simon J Mitchell",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      This is the second report based on a survey of Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) members who dive with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and diabetes. It examines the medical management of the divers' conditions, any diving modifications used to mitigate the risk and outcomes.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      An online cross-sectional survey was sent to 833 divers who had declared a targeted medical condition when applying for DAN AP membership between July 2009 and August 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two-hundred-and-sixty-eight respondents (32%) provided sufficient information on their conditions to be included in the analyses. These included ischaemic heart disease (31), arrhythmias (20), cardiac septal defects (31), other cardiac conditions (10), hypertension (127), diabetes (25), asthma (40) and pneumothorax (5). Forty-nine per cent had sought specialist diving medical advice about their condition and 23% reported modifying their diving practices to mitigate their risk. The cohort had completed 183,069 career dives, 57,822 of these since being diagnosed with their medical condition. There were 27 individuals who reported having decompression illness (25 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with a persistent foramen ovale), and two individuals who experienced an arrhythmia during diving.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Some DAN AP members are diving with medical conditions which could potentially impact the safety of their diving. A minority modified their diving practices to mitigate the risk of their condition and approximately half sought specialist diving medical advice. The incidence of diving-related problems precipitated by known and managed pre-existing health conditions seems low but further studies of larger cohorts and incorporating fatality data would be necessary to confirm this. These results are limited by the 32% response rate and potential for bias towards selection of those most careful with their health.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868599/,2022-11-28 03:00:19 AM
Recurrence of Spontaneous Pneumothorax Is Not Associated with Allegedly Risk-Prone Lifestyle Conduct,"Volker Steger, Ulrike Sostheim, Marcus Leistner, Thorsten Walles, Volker Steger, Ulrike Sostheim, Marcus Leistner, Thorsten Walles",2018 Feb 20,"Purpose:
        
      
      Spontaneous pneumothorax (PNTX) is a common disease frequently operated at specialized thoracic surgery units. Videothoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become the standard for treatment and recurrence prevention. While there is broad consensus regarding indications and techniques of PNTX surgery, postoperative risks and consecutive patient behavioral advice have not been sufficiently elucidated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Single-center cohort analysis of 641 patients operated for primary PNTX by VATS over 10 years. Putatively recurrence-prone lifestyle activities (smoking status, flying habits, and scuba diving) and actual occurrence of recurrences were correlated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Follow-up rate was 46% (279/607 patients). Mean time interval between primary operation and follow-up was 61 (range: 5-177) months. In 10 patients (3.6%), a PNTX recurrence was observed. Regarding postoperative risk behavior reported at follow-up, 28% of patients were active smokers (15 ± 7 cigarettes/day), 59% traveled by plane repeatedly, and only two patients did scuba diving (0.7%). Low body-mass-index was associated with an increase in PNTX recurrence, whereas smoking, flying, and scuba diving could not be identified as risk factors.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In our study, none of the supposed ""classic"" lifestyle-associated risk factors for PNTX recurrence after VATS proved to be a significant threat. Postoperative patient behavior might not be constrained by overcautious medical advice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29279462/,2022-11-28 03:00:20 AM

      Snorkelling is a popular aquatic activity which may result in fatal and non-fatal drowning. However, little is known about the scale of injury, factors impacting risk and strategies for prevention. This review assesses the current literature on snorkelling-related drowning with the aim of assessing available data, improving safety recommendations and reducing the global mortality burden.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature in English, Spanish and Portuguese language published between 1 January 1980 and 31 October 2020 was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. CINAHL Complete, Embase, Medline (Ovid), PubMed, SafetyLit, SportDiscus and grey literature were searched to identify studies reporting the incidence of fatal and non-fatal snorkelling-related drowning, or associated risk factors, prevention strategies, treatments or casualty characteristics. Quality was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-three studies were included (26 reporting population data, 17 case series), of which 27 (62.8%) studies reported data from Australia. Incidence was reported as about 8% of total ocean-related drownings. Case series documented 144 fatalities over 17 years. Frequent casualty characteristics include male (82.6%), pre-existing heart disease (59.4%), tourists (73%) who were inexperienced (71.0%), and lack of a buddy system (89.6%). Two at-risk profiles identified were older adult tourists with pre-existing medical conditions and local, experienced spearfishers. Twenty-two expert recommendations were developed to improve the safety of snorkellers related to individuals, tourism companies, government agencies and diving organisations.

Aquaculture divers perform repetitive, short-duration bounce dives in fish pens to depths up to 21 metres' sea water (msw). Past high levels of decompression illness (DCI) may have resulted from these 'yo-yo' dives. This study aimed to assess working divers, using Doppler ultrasonic bubble detection, to determine if yo-yo diving was a risk factor for DCI, determine dive profiles with acceptable risk and investigate productivity improvement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Field data were collected from working divers during bounce diving at marine farms near Hobart, Australia. Ascent rates were less than 18 m·min⁻¹, with routine safety stops (3 min at 3 msw) during the final ascent. The Kisman-Masurel method was used to grade bubbling post dive as a means of assessing decompression stress. In accordance with Defence Research and Development Canada Toronto practice, dives were rejected as excessive risk if more than 50% of scores were over Grade 2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 2002 to 2008, Doppler data were collected from 150 bounce-dive series (55 divers, 1,110 bounces). Three series of bounce profiles, characterized by in-water times, were validated: 13-15 msw, 10 bounces inside 75 min; 16-18 msw, six bounces inside 50 min; and 19-21 msw, four bounces inside 35 min. All had median bubble grades of 0. Further evaluation validated two successive series of bounces. Bubble grades were consistent with low-stress dive profiles. Bubble grades did not correlate with the number of bounces, but did correlate with ascent rate and in-water time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These data suggest bounce diving was not a major factor causing DCI in Tasmanian aquaculture divers. Analysis of field data has improved industry productivity by increasing the permissible number of bounces, compared to earlier empirically-derived tables, without compromising safety. The recommended Tasmanian Bounce Diving Tables provide guidance for bounce diving to a depth of 21 msw, and two successive bounce dive series in a day's diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25311318/,2022-11-28 03:00:21 AM

High intensity cycling before SCUBA diving reduces post-decompression microparticle production and neutrophil activation,"Dennis Madden, Stephen R Thom, Ming Yang, Veena M Bhopale, Marko Ljubkovic, Zeljko Dujic, Dennis Madden, Stephen R Thom, Ming Yang, Veena M Bhopale, Marko Ljubkovic, Zeljko Dujic",2014 Sep,"Background:
        
      
      Venous gas emboli (VGE) have traditionally served as a marker for decompression stress after SCUBA diving and a reduction in bubble loads is a target for precondition procedures. However, VGE can be observed in large quantities with no negative clinical consequences. The effect of exercise before diving on VGE has been evaluated with mixed results. Microparticle (MP) counts and sub-type expression serve as indicators of vascular inflammation and DCS in mice. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the effect of anaerobic cycling (AC) on VGE and MP following SCUBA diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ten male divers performed two dives to 18 m for 41 min, one dive (AC) was preceded by a repeated-Wingate cycling protocol; a control dive (CON) was completed without exercise. VGE were analyzed at 15, 40, 80, and 120 min post-diving. Blood for MP analysis was collected before exercise (AC only), before diving, 15 and 120 min after surfacing.
    


          Results:
        
      
      VGE were significantly lower 15 min post-diving in the AC group, with no difference in the remaining measurements. MPs were elevated by exercise and diving, however, post-diving elevations were attenuated in the AC dive. Some markers of neutrophil elevation (CD18, CD41) were increased in the CON compared to the AC dive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The repeated-Wingate protocol resulted in an attenuation of MP counts and sub-types that have been related to vascular injury and DCS-like symptoms in mice. Further studies are needed to determine if MPs represent a risk factor or marker for DCS in humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24917356/,2022-11-28 03:00:23 AM
Iso-risk air no decompression limits after scoring marginal decompression sickness cases as non-events,"F Gregory Murphy, Ashleigh J Swingler, Wayne A Gerth, Laurens E Howle, F Gregory Murphy, Ashleigh J Swingler, Wayne A Gerth, Laurens E Howle",2018 Jan 1,"Decompression sickness (DCS) in humans is associated with reductions in ambient pressure that occur during diving, aviation, or certain manned spaceflight operations. Its signs and symptoms can include, but are not limited to, joint pain, radiating abdominal pain, paresthesia, dyspnea, general malaise, cognitive dysfunction, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, and death. Probabilistic models of DCS allow the probability of DCS incidence and time of occurrence during or after a given hyperbaric or hypobaric exposure to be predicted based on how the gas contents or gas bubble volumes vary in hypothetical tissue compartments during the exposure. These models are calibrated using data containing the pressure and respired gas histories of actual exposures, some of which resulted in DCS, some of which did not, and others in which the diagnosis of DCS was not clear. The latter are referred to as marginal DCS cases. In earlier works, a marginal DCS event was typically weighted as 0.1, with a full DCS event being weighted as 1.0, and a non-event being weighted as 0.0. Recent work has shown that marginal DCS events should be weighted as 0.0 when calibrating gas content models. We confirm this indication in the present work by showing that such models have improved performance when calibrated to data with marginal DCS events coded as non-events. Further, we investigate the ramifications of derating marginal events on model-prescribed air diving no-stop limits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29175087/,2022-11-28 03:00:23 AM
USN Treatment Table 9,"Dick Clarke, Dick Clarke",2017 Mar,"The United States Navy (USN) introduced Treatment Table 9 (USN TT9) in 1999. Its purpose is to provide a dosing protocol for cases of incomplete resolution of decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism following initial provision of USN Treatment Table 6 (USN TT6). It also can be used for several non-diving-related acute toxicities. Prior to USN TT9, it was and remains common to use USN Treatment Table 5 (USN TT5) for 'follow-up' therapy. An exception might be cases of severe residual neurologic injury, where some prefer to repeat USN TT6. The primary role of USN TT5, however, is for treatment of 'pain only' (Type 1) DCS that has fully resolved within 10 minutes of the first oxygen breathing period at 60 feet of seawater (fsw) (284 kPa). It is thought helpful here to point out that USN TT9 offers certain safety and operational advantages over USN TT5. As USN TT9 employs a maximum pressure of 243 kPa, a marked risk reduction exists for the injured diver in terms of CNS oxygen toxicity. Seizures are reported during treatment of divers using US Navy protocols, some as early as the second and in one case during the first oxygen breathing period at 284 kPa (Mitchell SJ, personal communication, 2016). The inside attendant likewise enjoys an iatrogenic DCS risk reduction. While air breathing exposure time at 60 fsw on USN TT5 appears modest at first blush, the table can be extended at 30 fsw (203 kPa) for two additional oxygen/air cycles. Such extensions result in a not inconsiderable total exposure time of three hours. DCS risk is also increased if the treatment represents a repetitive dive for the attendant, a not uncommon event. Given the ongoing occurrence of inside attendant DCS, in some cases career ending and twice with fatal outcome, its mitigation should be aggressively pursued (author's personal files). From an operational perspective, both treatment pressure and sequencing of oxygen/air breathing cycles during delivery of USN TT9 are essentially identical to that commonly employed during multiplace chamber delivery of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Accordingly, it is straightforward enough to incorporate follow-up decompression illness cases into daily clinical practice. Not having this dosing 'match', i.e., using USN TT5, might otherwise disrupt regularly scheduled cases. In my capacity as a medical claims adjudicator and clinical resource, I am involved, to varying degrees, in more than 300 cases of decompression illness each year. In those involving more than a single treatment, it is very much the exception, even after 17 years since its introduction, that USN TT9 is employed. The primary purpose of this correspondence, then, is to make mention of the advantages of USN TT9 and remind providers that it is indeed a standard of care in cases of incomplete relief for those who choose to base decompression injury management decisions on USN treatment procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28357827/,2022-11-28 03:00:24 AM
The future of diving research in Norway,"Andreas Møllerløkken, Andreas Møllerløkken",2018 Jun 30,"Norway has a long tradition of quality research within the field of baromedicine. With the discovery of oil in the North Sea, it became important to establish scientific research facilities to overcome immediate challenges, but also to work towards long-term goals. For the diving community, an understanding of the pathophysiology of decompression sickness (DCS) has been one of the major forces to maintain focus on the importance of scientific research in this field. In addition to oil, the aquaculture and fish farming industries are increasing in size and are Norway's second biggest export industry today. It also requires underwater workers for the inspection and repair of underwater structures and fishnets. The importance of health and safety for the underwater worker was identified early on by the offshore industry. The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority publishes a yearly report that identifies all offshore diving activity. The last reported incident of DCS was in 2002, whilst the last fatal saturation diving accident was in 1987. In-shore diving operations in Norway are regulated through the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority and here the track record is different; since 1979 there have been 28 fatalities, and they continue to occur. At the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), there has been a research group investigating barophysiology since the early 1980s. Led by Professor Alf O Brubakk, this research has been recognized internationally and has provided ground-breaking insights into the pathophysiology of DCS. This has included the identification of vascular gas bubbles through the use of ultrasound and identifying the importance of both protecting the vascular endothelium to maintain fitness to dive and also regular physical activity to reduce the risk of the adverse effects of diving. The group has educated many students, physiologists, engineers, medical doctors and researchers, all in the spirit of Professor Brubakk who considered that education was at least as important as the research itself. In 2008, Professor Brubakk was concerned about the future, as he was soon to retire. Great effort was put into perpetuating his position but this process ended when the University axed the only professorial position in environmental physiology in Norway. Today, there is only one non-permanent barophysiology research position at NTNU. This position and all research activity is dependent on external funding, so the education and research environment has changed drastically. Whilst there are clinicians in Norway working at different hyperbaric centres who participate in research related to barophysiology, this is not their primary task. With the lack of funding to include education and students in research, the rich history of barophysiological research at NTNU will be at an end. In Norway, the majority of grant-funded scientific programmes last only three years, so it has not been easy to recruit or to keep expertise between grants. So, who is planning for long-term research efforts in Norway? Whilst there are obvious challenges left to study in barophysiology, there is a lack of understanding amongst those responsible for decision-making and funding of the importance of having an academic-based research centre for diving research. NTNU, one of the world's most advanced hyperbaric laboratories, built up at considerable capital expense to investigate the pathophysiology of diving and decompression, is about to be closed and dismantled. At a time when the off-shore industry is putting greater focus on finding better solutions for safer underwater work environments, and in-shore diving is facing huge challenges due to a worrying level of serious accidents and increasing activity, there is no political drive in Norway to acknowledge the importance of maintaining the research facilities that support this industry. If the door does close on the NTNU facility, it will take many years and substantial funding to re-establish a modern research centre. Most importantly, it will be impossible to bring new students into the field of barophysiology in the foreseeable future. Whilst the off-shore oil industry has a finite future, aquaculture and other in-shore activities requiring diving support continue to expand. Good barophysiological research in established centres will be essential to support these industries into the future. Alf Brubakk often quoted an old Chinese proverb: ""When planning for a month, sow rice, when planning for a year, plant trees, when planning for a decade, train and educate men"". In Norway, we are only planting trees.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888377/,2022-11-28 03:00:25 AM

Safety Priorities and Underestimations in Recreational Scuba Diving Operations: A European Study Supporting the Implementation of New Risk Management Programmes,"Serena Lucrezi, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Francois Burman, Tamer Ozyigit, Danilo Cialoni, Guy Thomas, Alessandro Marroni, Melville Saayman, Serena Lucrezi, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Francois Burman, Tamer Ozyigit, Danilo Cialoni, Guy Thomas, Alessandro Marroni, Melville Saayman",2018 Mar 23,"Introduction: Scuba diving is an important marine tourism sector, but requires proper safety standards to reduce the risks and increase accessibility to its market. To achieve safety goals, safety awareness and positive safety attitudes in recreational scuba diving operations are essential. However, there is no published research exclusively focusing on scuba divers' and dive centres' perceptions toward safety. This study assessed safety perceptions in recreational scuba diving operations, with the aim to inform and enhance safety and risk management programmes within the scuba diving tourism industry. Materials and Methods: Two structured questionnaire surveys were prepared by the organisation Divers Alert Network and administered online to scuba diving operators in Italy and scuba divers in Europe, using a mixture of convenience and snowball sampling. Questions in the survey included experience and safety offered at the dive centre; the buddy system; equipment and accessories for safe diving activities; safety issues in the certification of new scuba divers; incidents/accidents; and attitudes toward safety. Results: 91 scuba diving centres and 3,766 scuba divers participated in the study. Scuba divers gave importance to safety and the responsiveness of service providers, here represented by the dive centres. However, they underestimated the importance of a personal emergency action/assistance plan and, partly, of the buddy system alongside other safety procedures. Scuba divers agreed that some risks, such as those associated with running out of gas, deserve attention. Dive centres gave importance to aspects such as training and emergency action/assistance plans. However, they were limitedly involved in safety campaigning. Dive centres' perceptions of safety in part aligned with those of scuba divers, with some exceptions. Conclusion: Greater responsibility is required in raising awareness and educating scuba divers, through participation in prevention campaigns and training. The study supports the introduction of programmes aiming to create a culture of safety among dive centres and scuba divers. Two examples, which are described in this paper, include the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment protocol for dive centres and scuba divers, and the Diving Safety Officer programme to create awareness, improve risk management, and mitigate health and safety risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29628904/,2022-11-28 03:00:26 AM
"Dive Risk Factors, Gas Bubble Formation, and Decompression Illness in Recreational SCUBA Diving: Analysis of DAN Europe DSL Data Base","Danilo Cialoni, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni, Danilo Cialoni, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni",2017 Sep 19,"Introduction: The popularity of SCUBA diving is steadily increasing together with the number of dives and correlated diseases per year. The rules that govern correct decompression procedures are considered well known even if the majority of Decompression Sickness (DCS) cases are considered unexpected confirming a bias in the ""mathematical ability"" to predict DCS by the current algorithms. Furthermore, little is still known about diving risk factors and any individual predisposition to DCS. This study provides an in-depth epidemiological analysis of the diving community, to include additional risk factors correlated with the development of circulating bubbles and DCS. Materials and Methods: An originally developed database (DAN DB) including specific questionnaires for data collection allowed the statistical analysis of 39,099 electronically recorded open circuit dives made by 2,629 European divers (2,189 males 83.3%, 440 females 16.7%) over 5 years. The same dive parameters and risk factors were investigated also in 970 out of the 39,099 collected dives investigated for bubble formation, by 1-min precordial Doppler, and in 320 sea-level dives followed by DCS symptoms. Results: Mean depth and GF high of all the recorded dives were 27.1 m, and 0.66, respectively; the average ascent speed was lower than the currently recommended ""safe"" one (9-10 m/min). We found statistically significant relationships between higher bubble grades and BMI, fat mass, age, and diving exposure. Regarding incidence of DCS, we identified additional non-bubble related risk factors, which appear significantly related to a higher DCS incidence, namely: gender, strong current, heavy exercise, and workload during diving. We found that the majority of the recorded DCS cases were not predicted by the adopted decompression algorithm and would have therefore been defined as ""undeserved."" Conclusion: The DAN DB analysis shows that most dives were made in a ""safe zone,"" even if data show an evident ""gray area"" in the ""mathematical"" ability to predict DCS by the current algorithms. Some other risk factors seem to influence the possibility to develop DCS, irrespective of their effect on bubble formation, thus suggesting the existence of some factors influencing or enhancing the effects of bubbles.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28974936/,2022-11-28 03:00:27 AM
Deep-diving beaked whales dive together but forage apart,"Jesús Alcázar-Treviño, Mark Johnson, Patricia Arranz, Victoria E Warren, Carlos J Pérez-González, Tiago Marques, Peter T Madsen, Natacha Aguilar de Soto, Jesús Alcázar-Treviño, Mark Johnson, Patricia Arranz, Victoria E Warren, Carlos J Pérez-González, Tiago Marques, Peter T Madsen, Natacha Aguilar de Soto",2021 Jan 13,"Echolocating animals that forage in social groups can potentially benefit from eavesdropping on other group members, cooperative foraging or social defence, but may also face problems of acoustic interference and intra-group competition for prey. Here, we investigate these potential trade-offs of sociality for extreme deep-diving Blainville's and Cuvier's beaked whales. These species perform highly synchronous group dives as a presumed predator-avoidance behaviour, but the benefits and costs of this on foraging have not been investigated. We show that group members could hear their companions for a median of at least 91% of the vocal foraging phase of their dives. This enables whales to coordinate their mean travel direction despite differing individual headings as they pursue prey on a minute-by-minute basis. While beaked whales coordinate their echolocation-based foraging periods tightly, individual click and buzz rates are both independent of the number of whales in the group. Thus, their foraging performance is not affected by intra-group competition or interference from group members, and they do not seem to capitalize directly on eavesdropping on the echoes produced by the echolocation clicks of their companions. We conclude that the close diving and vocal synchronization of beaked whale groups that quantitatively reduces predation risk has little impact on foraging performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33402065/,2022-11-28 03:00:27 AM

Diving in the Arctic: Cold Water Immersion's Effects on Heart Rate Variability in Navy Divers,"Richard V Lundell, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Tomi K Wuorimaa, Tommi Ojanen, Kai I Parkkola, Richard V Lundell, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Tomi K Wuorimaa, Tommi Ojanen, Kai I Parkkola",2020 Jan 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diving close to the Arctic circle means diving in cold water regardless of the time of year. The human body reacts to cold through autonomous nervous system (ANS)-mediated thermoregulatory mechanisms. Diving also induces ANS responses as a result of the diving reflex.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In order to study ANS responses during diving in Arctic water temperatures, we retrospectively analyzed repeated 5-min heart rate variability (HRV) measures and the mean body temperature from dives at regular intervals using naval diving equipment measurement tests in 0°C water. Three divers performed seven dives without physical activity (81-91 min), and two divers performed four dives with physical activity after 10 min of diving (0-10 min HRV recordings were included in the study).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our study showed a significant increase in parasympathetic activity (PNS) at the beginning of the dives, after which PNS activity decreased significantly (measure 5-10 min). Subsequent measurements (15-20 min and onward) showed a significant increase in PNS activity over time.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results suggest that the first PNS responses of the human diving reflex decrease quickly. Adverse effects of PNS activity should be considered on long and cold dives. To avoid concurrent sympathetic (SNS) and PNS activity at the beginning of dives, which in turn may increase the risk of arrhythmia in cold water, we suggest a short adaptation phase before physical activity. Moreover, we suggest it is prudent to give special attention to cardiovascular risk factors during pre-dive examinations for cold water divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32082177/,2022-11-28 03:00:29 AM
Exercise before and after SCUBA diving and the role of cellular microparticles in decompression stress,"Dennis Madden, Stephen R Thom, Zeljko Dujic, Dennis Madden, Stephen R Thom, Zeljko Dujic",2016 Jan,"Risk in SCUBA diving is often associated with the presence of gas bubbles in the venous circulation formed during decompression. Although it has been demonstrated time-after-time that, while venous gas emboli (VGE) often accompany decompression sickness (DCS), they are also frequently observed in high quantities in asymptomatic divers following even mild recreational dive profiles. Despite this VGE are commonly utilized as a quantifiable marker of the potential for an individual to develop DCS. Certain interventions such as exercise, antioxidant supplements, vibration, and hydration appear to impact VGE production and the decompression process. However promising these procedures may seem, the data are not yet conclusive enough to warrant changes in decompression procedure, possibly suggesting a component of individual response. We hypothesize that the impact of exercise varies widely in individuals and once tested, recommendations can be made that will reduce individual decompression stress and possibly the incidence of DCS. The understanding of physiological adaptations to diving stress can be applied in different diseases that include endothelial dysfunction and microparticle (MP) production. Exercise before diving is viewed by some as a protective form of preconditioning because some studies have shown that it reduces VGE quantity. We propose that MP production and clearance might be a part of this mechanism. Exercise after diving appears to impact the risk of adverse events as well. Research suggests that the arterialization of VGE presents a greater risk for DCS than when emboli are eliminated by the pulmonary circuit before they have a chance to crossover. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that exercise increases the incidence of crossover likely through extra-cardiac mechanisms such as intrapulmonary arterial-venous anastomoses (IPAVAs). This effect of exercise has been repeated in the field with divers demonstrating a direct relationship between exercise and increased incidence of arterialization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804603/,2022-11-28 03:00:29 AM
Audit of waist measurement methods during statutory diving medical assessments,"N Williams, A Moore, M Woods, S Forman, N Williams, A Moore, M Woods, S Forman",2021 Aug 20,"Background:
        
      
      Measurement of waist circumference is used to assess abdominal fat and risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and stroke. It is performed in several clinical settings for health promotion and medical assessment purposes, including statutory medical assessments where results may influence decisions on fitness to work. Under the Diving at Work Regulations 1997, working divers must have an annual assessment of their fitness to dive performed by an approved medical examiner of divers (AMED), appointed by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The assessment includes measurement of height, weight and waist circumference, the latter used as an indicator of central adiposity and associated health risks.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To establish the practice of AMEDs in measuring waist circumference of working divers undergoing medical assessment to determine their fitness to dive.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ninety-seven AMEDs were sent a questionnaire and asked to describe their current practice in measuring waist circumference. The response rate was 79%. The audit standard used was the consensus document published by the World Health Organization (WHO).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 77 responses, 76 were completed sufficiently to allow analysis. When the waist was measured, there was consistency in the diver's level of clothing, stage of breathing and posture for the procedure but variability in the site of measurement. Only 7/76 (9%) respondents carried out waist measurement fully in line with WHO guidance.

      The audit has identified that there is a need for guidance for AMEDs on measuring waist circumference in the statutory medical assessment of working divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34415343/,2022-11-28 03:00:30 AM
Return To Diving,"Klaus D. Torp, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie, Klaus D. Torp, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie",,"Decompression illness is caused by bubbles that appear in either the bloodstream or in other tissues in the body by ascending too fast from either underwater depth to the surface or from the surface to an altitude such as in high altitude fighter pilots. When ambient pressure increases, such as during diving, so will the pressure of any gas that the person is breathing. This gas will get distributed throughout the body at different speeds, where highly vascularized tissues equilibrate at a faster rate. Bubbles are formed when the ambient pressure is reduced faster than the ability of the blood or tissue to transport the gas which is in solution (usually nitrogen) to the lungs to get exhaled. These bubbles can have various and complex effects on the body, from direct obstruction of blood flow, obstruction of lymph flow, to nerve injury either by direct irritation or through inflammatory mediators. These effects can be mild, resulting in pain or paresthesias, or severe, leading to paralysis and death. One of the most widely used classifications of decompression illness is decompression sickness type 1 (DCS1) with mild pain only or (mild) skin symptoms, decompression sickness type 2 (DCS2) with neurological involvement, and arterial gas embolism (AGE), resulting from pulmonary barotrauma. The primary treatment of decompression illness is recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, which will increase the ambient pressure again, reducing the speed of new bubble formation and reducing existing bubble size as well as creating a large diffusion gradient for the offending gas by breathing 100% oxygen. The appropriate treatment of decompression illness is usually very effective, especially when started early after the injury, leaving either minimal or no residual effects. Most residual effects will improve even further with time as the body is trying to heal, however, some residual effects may be permanent. In addition, a diver may also suffer from barotrauma to air-filled spaces such as ears, sinuses, and the lungs during a dive.
    

      
      After an episode of decompression illness or other diving-related injuries, many divers want to go diving again either for recreation, work, or military service. A thorough understanding of the factors that led to the injury and careful clinical exam will help the diving medicine specialist to decide if additional tests are indicated and to advise the diver of his future risk with a return to diving. Guidelines do exist for military, government, scientific and commercial divers.

Repetitive freshwater diving: risk factors and prevalence of barotrauma,"Stefanie Jansen, Moritz Friedo Meyer, Manuela Boor, Ruth Volland, Eberhard Daniel Pracht, Heinz Dieter Klünter, Karl-Bernd Hüttenbrink, Dirk Beutner, Maria Grosheva, Stefanie Jansen, Moritz Friedo Meyer, Manuela Boor, Ruth Volland, Eberhard Daniel Pracht, Heinz Dieter Klünter, Karl-Bernd Hüttenbrink, Dirk Beutner, Maria Grosheva",2017 Sept-Oct,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim was to investigate the influence of repetitive scuba diving in fresh water on the middle ear mucosa. The prevalence of middle ear barotrauma (MEB) and risk factors for MEB were evaluated.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Prospective cohort study, Level of evidence 1b.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      During three days, 23 divers made 144 repetitive dives in a freshwater lake. Participants underwent otoscopic examinations and were questioned about ENT-related complaints in the morning before the first dive, in between the dives and after the last dive. Otoscopic findings were documented and classified according to the TEED scale (0 = normal eardrum to 4 = perforation), for the right and the left ear separately.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 416 examinations were performed. ENT-related complaints during diving, mostly failed pressure equalization (74%), were reported after 10% of all dives. Most common pathology was MEB (TEED 1-3, 26%). Valsalva maneuver was possible during all exams. Significant increase of MEB (TEED⟩0) occurred with an increasing cumulative number of dives per day (P ⟨ .0001). Diving depth significantly influenced the MEB distribution (P = .035). MEB with higher TEED levels (2 and 3) was present only in the less experienced and intermediate divers. With increasing TEED level, more participants reported ENT-related problems (P ⟨ .0001). However, 74.4% of divers with MEB were still asymptomatic.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      During three days of diving, the MEB prevalence increased with a cumulative number of dives per day. The major risk factors were diving depth and diving experience. Higher TEED level correlated with an increasing number of subjective ENT-related disorders during diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29116695/,2022-11-28 03:00:31 AM
Pediatric and adolescent injury in aquatic adventure sports,"Peter Buzzacott, Anna Mease, Peter Buzzacott, Anna Mease",2018,"Drowning is a leading cause of death in children. Each year there are thousands of injuries in children, some fatal, associated with aquatic adventure sports. Personal water craft rapidly accelerate children to high velocities, as does being towed behind boats on skis or tubes, whereupon children have no control of their speed or direction. Canoeing and white-water kayaking particularly stress the upper limbs and shoulder dislocations are a primary concern. Surfing and kite-surfing generate more injuries to the head and face than other parts of the body and, in scuba diving, children most frequently injure their ears due to the acute pressure changes experienced. Aquatic injuries cost more in children than in adults and residual functional deficits may last a lifetime. There is a pressing need for research into the prevalence and incidence of aquatic injuries in children, so the effectiveness of preventive interventions can be determined.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30431355/,2022-11-28 03:00:32 AM
Provisional report on diving-related fatalities in Australian waters 2010,"John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Andrew Fock, Thomas Wodak, Scott Jamieson, Richard Harris, Douglas Walker, John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Andrew Fock, Thomas Wodak, Scott Jamieson, Richard Harris, Douglas Walker",2015 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      An individual case review was conducted of known diving-related deaths that occurred in Australia in 2010.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The case studies were compiled using statements from witnesses and reports of the police and coroners. In each case, the particular circumstances of the accident and details from the post-mortem examination, where available, are provided. A root cause analysis was made for each case.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 20 reported fatalities, one less than the previous year. Five of the victims were female (four scuba divers) and 15 were males. Twelve deaths occurred while snorkelling and/or breath-hold diving, seven while scuba diving (one of whom was using a rebreather), and one diver died while using surface supplied breathing apparatus. At least two breath-hold divers likely drowned as a result of apnoeic hypoxia. Cardiac-related issues were thought to have contributed to the deaths of at least three and possibly five snorkellers, and of at least one, possibly two compressed gas divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Snorkelling or diving alone, poor supervision, apnoeic hypoxia, pre-existing medical conditions, lack of recent experience and unfamiliar and/or poorly-functioning equipment were features in several deaths in this series. Reducing delays to CT-scanning and autopsy and coroners' reports documenting that the victim of a drowning was snorkelling or scuba diving at the time are aspects of the investigation of these fatalities that could be improved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415067/,2022-11-28 03:00:33 AM
"Taravana, vestibular decompression illness, and autochthonous distal arterial bubbles","Ran Arieli, Ran Arieli",2019 Jan,"Decompression bubbles can develop only from pre-existing gas micronuclei. These are the nanobubbles which appear on active hydrophobic spots (AHS) found on the luminal aspect of all blood vessels. Following decompression, with the propagation of blood along the arterial tree, diffusion parameters cause increased transfer of nitrogen from the tissue into the artery, and more so if perfusion is low. Taravana is a neurological form of decompression illness (DCI) prevalent in repeated breath-hold diving. A nanobubble on an AHS in a distal artery of the brain may receive an influx of nitrogen after each dive until it occludes the arterial blood flow. The vestibular organ has very low perfusion compared with the brain and the cochlea of the inner ear. We suggest that a nanobbubble on an AHS in the distal artery of the vestibular organ will receive a high influx of nitrogen from the surrounding tissue after decompression due to the low nitrogen clearance, thus expanding to cause vestibular DCI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30172778/,2022-11-28 03:00:33 AM
A risk function for behavioral disruption of Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) from mid-frequency active sonar,"David Moretti, Len Thomas, Tiago Marques, John Harwood, Ashley Dilley, Bert Neales, Jessica Shaffer, Elena McCarthy, Leslie New, Susan Jarvis, Ronald Morrissey, David Moretti, Len Thomas, Tiago Marques, John Harwood, Ashley Dilley, Bert Neales, Jessica Shaffer, Elena McCarthy, Leslie New, Susan Jarvis, Ronald Morrissey",2014 Jan 21,"There is increasing concern about the potential effects of noise pollution on marine life in the world's oceans. For marine mammals, anthropogenic sounds may cause behavioral disruption, and this can be quantified using a risk function that relates sound exposure to a measured behavioral response. Beaked whales are a taxon of deep diving whales that may be particularly susceptible to naval sonar as the species has been associated with sonar-related mass stranding events. Here we derive the first empirical risk function for Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) by combining in situ data from passive acoustic monitoring of animal vocalizations and navy sonar operations with precise ship tracks and sound field modeling. The hydrophone array at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, was used to locate vocalizing groups of Blainville's beaked whales and identify sonar transmissions before, during, and after Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar operations. Sonar transmission times and source levels were combined with ship tracks using a sound propagation model to estimate the received level (RL) at each hydrophone. A generalized additive model was fitted to data to model the presence or absence of the start of foraging dives in 30-minute periods as a function of the corresponding sonar RL at the hydrophone closest to the center of each group. This model was then used to construct a risk function that can be used to estimate the probability of a behavioral change (cessation of foraging) the individual members of a Blainville's beaked whale population might experience as a function of sonar RL. The function predicts a 0.5 probability of disturbance at a RL of 150 dBrms re µPa (CI: 144 to 155) This is 15dB lower than the level used historically by the US Navy in their risk assessments but 10 dB higher than the current 140 dB step-function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24465477/,2022-11-28 03:00:34 AM
Persistent pathology of the patent foramen ovale: a review of the literature,"Kenneth K Cho, Shaun Khanna, Phillip Lo, Daniel Cheng, David Roy, Kenneth K Cho, Shaun Khanna, Phillip Lo, Daniel Cheng, David Roy",2021 Jul,"A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is an interatrial shunt, with a prevalence of 20-34% in the general population. While most people do not have secondary manifestations of a PFO, some reported sequelae include ischaemic stroke, migraine, platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome and decompression illness. Furthermore, in some cases, PFO closure should be considered for patients before neurosurgery and for patients with concomitant carcinoid syndrome. Recent trials support PFO closure for ischaemic stroke patients with high risk PFOs and absence of other identified stroke mechanisms. While PFOs can be associated with migraine with auras, with some patients reporting symptomatic improvement after closure, the evidence from randomised controlled trials is less clear in supporting the use of PFO closure for migraine treatment. PFO closure for other indications such as platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome, decompression illness and paradoxical embolism are based largely on case series with good clinical outcomes.

Often, such accidents occur due to elevated inspired carbon dioxide. For instance, in cases of CO₂ elimination system failures during rebreather dives, elevated inspired partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂) can rapidly lead to dangerous levels of hypercapnia. Elevations in PaCO₂ (arterial pressure of PCO₂) can also occur in divers without a change in inspired PCO₂. In such cases, hypercapnia occurs due to alveolar hypoventilation. Several factors of the dive environment contribute to this effect through changes in minute ventilation and dead space. Predominantly, minute ventilation is reduced in diving due to changes in respiratory load and associated changes in respiratory control. Minute ventilation is further reduced by hyperoxic attenuation of chemosensitivity. Physiologic dead space is also increased due to elevated breathing gas density and to hyperoxia. The Haldane effect, a reduction in CO₂ solubility in blood due to hyperoxia, may contribute indirectly to hypercapnia through an increase in mixed venous PCO₂. In some individuals, low ventilatory response to hypercapnia may also contribute to carbon dioxide retention. This review outlines what is currently known about hypercapnia in diving, including its measurement, cause, mental and physical effects, and areas for future study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28779577/,2022-11-28 03:00:36 AM
Effect of Long-Term Diving Exposure on Sleep of Male Occupational Divers in Southern Taiwan: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Wei-Shih Tseng, Nian-Sheng Tzeng, Kung-Hung Lin, Nan-Chieh Huang, Man-Yuan Huang, Bor-Hwang Kang, Wei-Shih Tseng, Nian-Sheng Tzeng, Kung-Hung Lin, Nan-Chieh Huang, Man-Yuan Huang, Bor-Hwang Kang",2021 Jul 3,"Objective:
        
      
      Divers with a history of decompression sickness may be at high risk for sleep problems. However, limited studies have investigated the relationship between diving exposure and sleep problems of occupational divers. This study investigated the association between diving exposure and sleep quality and quantity among male occupational divers in southern Taiwan.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This descriptive, cross-sectional study included 52 occupational divers and 121 non-divers recruited from southern Taiwan in 2018. Survey data were collected using the Taiwanese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and a self-report questionnaire that included demographic variables, diving exposure/protocols, and factors associated with sleep quality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among all participants examined, occupational divers were significantly more likely to have both poor sleep quality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-6.06; P = 0.002) and excessive daytime sleepiness (adjusted OR = 4.49; 95% CI = 2.12-9.52; P < 0.001). The diving exposure time, depth, ascent rate, and decompression table use showed no significant associations between poor and good sleepers in the divers group. However, a history of decompression sickness was associated with poor sleep quality among divers (adjusted OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.07-4.54; P = 0.032).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results showed that occupational divers had poor sleep quality and more excessive sleepiness than non-divers. Decompression sickness likely contributes to poor sleep quality.

Musculoskeletal complaints among professional divers,"Fride Flatmo, Marit Grønning, Ågot Irgens, Fride Flatmo, Marit Grønning, Ågot Irgens",2019,"Background:
        
      
      Previous publications have indicated a high risk of musculoskeletal complaints among professional divers. This study aims to investigate which factors influence professional divers' risk of musculoskeletal complaints.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Based on data gathered from a postal questionnaire sent to Norwegian inshore divers in 2011, the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints, strain injuries and joint pain among divers with different certification levels, work-related tasks and decompression sickness (DCS) experiences were analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The risk of musculoskeletal complaints, strain injuries and joint pain was significantly higher among divers working in the quay/construction industry versus divers not working in this industry, and among divers who had experienced DCS. Likewise, a higher risk was found among divers doing construction, inspection, pipelaying, blasting and welding, other physically demanding work, and working with vibrating and/or rotating tools. Having experienced tingling and/or numbness in fingers after working with vibrating and/or rotating tools or having sick leave due to tendonitis, periosteum inflammation, stretch injuries or sprains caused by diving also increased the risk.
    


          Conclusions:

Joint position statement on persistent foramen ovale (PFO) and diving. South Paciﬁc Underwater Medicine Society (SPUMS) and the United Kingdom Sports Diving Medical Committee (UKSDMC),"David Smart, Simon Mitchell, Peter Wilmshurst, Mark Turner, Neil Banham, David Smart, Simon Mitchell, Peter Wilmshurst, Mark Turner, Neil Banham",2015 Jun,"This consensus statement is the result of a workshop at the SPUMS Annual Scientiﬁc Meeting 2014 with representatives of the UK Sports Diving Medical Committee (UKSDMC) present, and subsequent discussions including the entire UKSDMC. Right-to-left shunt across a persistent or patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a risk factor for some types of decompression illness. It was agreed that routine screening for PFO is not currently justiﬁable, but certain high risk sub-groups can be identiﬁed. Divers with a history of cerebral, spinal, inner-ear or cutaneous decompression illness, migraine with aura, a family history of PFO or atrial septal defect and those with other forms of congenital heart disease are considered to be at higher risk. For these individuals, screening should be considered. If screening is undertaken it should be by bubble contrast transthoracic echocardiography with provocative manoeuvres, including Valsalva release and snifﬁng. Appropriate quality control is important. If a shunt is present, advice should be provided by an experienced diving physician taking into account the clinical context and the size of shunt. Reduction in gas load by limiting depth, repetitive dives and avoiding lifting and straining may all be appropriate. Divers may consider transcatheter device closure of the PFO in order to return to normal diving. If transcatheter PFO closure is undertaken, repeat bubble contrast echocardiography must be performed to conﬁrm adequate reduction or abolition of the right-to-left shunt, and the diver should have stopped taking potent anti-platelet therapy (aspirin is acceptable).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165538/,2022-11-28 03:00:41 AM
Flying after diving: should recommendations be reviewed? In-flight echocardiographic study in bubble-prone and bubble-resistant divers,"Danilo Cialoni, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni, Danilo Cialoni, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni",2015 Mar,"Introduction:
        
      
      Inert gas accumulated after multiple recreational dives can generate tissue supersaturation and bubble formation when ambient pressure decreases. We hypothesized that this could happen even if divers respected the currently recommended 24-hour pre-flight surface interval (PFSI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on a group of 56 healthy scuba divers (39 male, 17 female) as follows: first echo--during the outgoing flight, no recent dives; second echo--before boarding the return flight, after a multiday diving week in the tropics and a 24-hour PFSI; third echo--during the return flight at 30, 60 and 90 minutes after take-off. TTE was also done after every dive during the week's diving. Divers were divided into three groups according to their 'bubble-proneness': non-bubblers, occasional bubblers and consistent bubblers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the diving, 23 subjects never developed bubbles, 17 only occasionally and 16 subjects produced bubbles every day and after every dive. Bubbles on the return flight were observed in eight of the 56 divers (all from the 'bubblers' group). Two subjects who had the highest bubble scores during the diving were advised not to make the last dive (increasing their PFSI to approximately 36 hours), and did not demonstrate bubbles on the return flight.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Even though a 24-hour PFSI is recommended on the basis of clinical trials showing a low risk of decompression sickness (DCS), the presence of venous gas bubbles in-flight in eight of 56 divers leads us to suspect that in real-life situations DCS risk after such a PFSI is not zero.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964033/,2022-11-28 03:00:42 AM

Estimating the risk of a scuba diving fatality in Australia,"John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, Jo Williams, John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, Jo Williams",2016 Dec,"Introduction:
        
      
      There are few data available on which to estimate the risk of death for Australian divers. This report estimates the risk of a scuba diving fatality for Australian residents, international tourists diving in Queensland, and clients of a large Victorian dive operator.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      Numerators for the estimates were obtained from the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific dive fatality database. Denominators were derived from three sources: Participation in Exercise, Recreation and Sport Surveys, 2001-2010 (Australian resident diving activity data); Tourism Research Australia surveys of international visitors to Queensland 2006-2014 and a dive operator in Victoria 2007-2014. Annual fatality rates (AFR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using an exact binomial test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Estimated AFRs were: 0.48 (0.37-0.59) deaths per 100,000 dives, or 8.73 (6.85-10.96) deaths per 100,000 divers for Australian residents; 0.12 (0.05-0.25) deaths per 100,000 dives, or 0.46 (0.20-0.91) deaths per 100,000 divers for international visitors to Queensland; and 1.64 (0.20-5.93) deaths per 100,000 dives for the dive operator in Victoria. On a per diver basis, Australian residents are estimated to be almost twenty times more likely to die whilst scuba diving than are international visitors to Queensland, or to lower than fourfold on a per dive basis. On a per dive basis, divers in Victoria are fourteen times more likely to die than are Queensland international tourists.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although some of the estimates are based on potentially unreliable denominator data extrapolated from surveys, the diving fatality rates in Australia appear to vary by State, being considerably lower in Queensland than in Victoria. These estimates are similar to or lower than comparable overseas estimates, although reliability of all such measurements varies with study size and accuracy of the data available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27966203/,2022-11-28 03:00:43 AM

Safety behaviour and healthy diving: a qualitative study in the traditional diverse fishermen,"Kusnanto Kusnanto, La Rakhmat Wabula, Bambang Purwanto, Hidayat Arifin, Yulia Kurniawati, Kusnanto Kusnanto, La Rakhmat Wabula, Bambang Purwanto, Hidayat Arifin, Yulia Kurniawati",2020,"Background:
        
      
      Traditional divers from the Maluku Province of Indonesia have not received formal education and training related to standard diving tools. They only become accomplished at diving generation by generation. The use of non-standard diving tools increases the risk of injury and illness. This study aimed to get an overview of the health and safety behaviours of traditional divers.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The study was qualitative, involving 15 traditional divers who used compressors for at least 1 year and who'd had decompression sickness and barotrauma as a result of diving. The data was obtained through in-depth interviews, analysed through the Colaizzi method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The participants' diving health and safety behaviour is triggered by the perception of the risk of diving. This is supported by the reinforcing social and environmental factors leading to the form of health and safety behaviour when diving. These behaviours include diving without planning, using a compressor, and making ""sesajen"" (kind of food, leaves, and water that are believed to be a form of surrender to the creator) which is an offering or present to the gods or ancestors. This behaviour causes complaints such as trauma and an increased economic burden. Some participants consider complaints as a threat and plan to stop diving. The participants made a plan before dive and declared that they would change their behaviour to ensure safety.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health and safety behaviour related to diving must be socialised and facilitated.

A survey on the health status of Dutch scuba diving instructors,"Prashant Komdeur, Thijs T Wingelaar, Rob A van Hulst, Prashant Komdeur, Thijs T Wingelaar, Rob A van Hulst",2021 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      As the diving population is ageing, so are the diving instructors. Health issues and the use of prescribed medications are more common when ageing. The death of two diving instructors during one weekend in 2017 in the Netherlands, most likely due to cardiovascular disease, motivated investigation of the prevalence of relevant comorbidities in Dutch diving instructors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All Dutch Underwater Federation diving instructors were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Questions addressed diving experience and current and past medical history including the use of medications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A response rate of 27% yielded 497 questionnaires (87% male, average age 57.3 years [SD 8.5]). Older instructors were over-represented among responders (82% of males and 75% of females > 50 years versus 66% of males and 51% of females among the invited cohort). Forty-six percent of respondents reported no current medical condition. Hypertension was the most commonly reported condition followed by hay fever and problems equalising ears and sinuses. Thirty-two percent reported no past medical condition. Problems of equalising ears and sinuses was the most common past medical condition, followed by hypertension, joint problems or surgery, and hay fever. Fifty-nine percent used non-prescription medication; predominantly analgesics and nose or ear drops. Forty-nine percent used prescription medicine, mostly cardiovascular and respiratory drugs. Body mass index (BMI) was > 25 kg·m-2 in 66% of males and 38% of females. All instructors with any type of cardiovascular disease were overweight.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Nineteen percent of responding diving instructors suffered from cardiovascular disease with above-normal BMI and almost 60% used prescribed or non-prescribed medication. Some dived while suffering from medical issues or taking medications, which could lead to medical problems during emergency situations with their students.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761537/,2022-11-28 03:00:46 AM
Venous Gas Embolism,"Matthew J. Kerrigan, Jeffrey S. Cooper, Matthew J. Kerrigan, Jeffrey S. Cooper",,"Venous gas embolism is defined by an abnormal collection of gas that forms a bubble in the systemic venous circulation. This bubble can act as an embolus affecting blood flow. In most cases, venous gas embolism is iatrogenic in nature. It may occur during cannulation of the central veins, head and neck surgery, blunt and penetrating chest trauma, thoracentesis, hemodialysis, and high pressure during mechanical ventilation. Venous gas embolism is known to occur during diving and during the injection of radiocontrast for CT scans. Most cases of venous gas embolism are benign and are not even reported. However, when symptoms develop, the disorder does require immediate treatment as there is a risk of death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29489147/,2022-11-28 03:00:47 AM
"Mortality rate during professionally guided scuba diving experiences for uncertified divers, 1992-2019","Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Karl Shreeves",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to re-examine the mortality rate among participants in the Professional Association of Diving Instructors' (PADI)'s Discover Scuba Diving (DSD) programme.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fatalities reported to PADI as having occurred during DSD scuba dives were counted for each year between 1992 and 2019. DSD participant registrations were also counted for each year. The data were conveniently divided into two equal 14-year periods, 1992-2005 ('early') and 2006-2019 ('late'). To smooth out the year-to-year variation in raw rates, Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the mean rate per 100,000 participants per year during each period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were a total of 7,118,731 DSD participant registrations and 79 fatalities during the study period. The estimated overall mean mortality rate in the early period was 2.55 per 100,000 DSD registrations whereas the estimated rate of 0.87 per 100,000 DSD registrations was significantly lower in the late period (P < 0.0001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PADI's contemporary Discover Scuba Diving introductory scuba experiences, at 0.87 fatalities per 100,000 participants, have a calculated mortality rate that is less than half that calculated for 1992-2008. The late period's rate improvement appears due either to significant under-registration in the early period, or to significant safety-performance improvement in the late period or, more likely, some combination of the two.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157729/,2022-11-28 03:00:47 AM
How man-made interference might cause gas bubble emboli in deep diving whales,"Andreas Fahlman, Peter L Tyack, Patrick J O Miller, Petter H Kvadsheim, Andreas Fahlman, Peter L Tyack, Patrick J O Miller, Petter H Kvadsheim",2014 Jan 28,"Recent cetacean mass strandings in close temporal and spatial association with sonar activity has raised the concern that anthropogenic sound may harm breath-hold diving marine mammals. Necropsy results of the stranded whales have shown evidence of bubbles in the tissues, similar to those in human divers suffering from decompression sickness (DCS). It has been proposed that changes in behavior or physiological responses during diving could increase tissue and blood N2 levels, thereby increasing DCS risk. Dive data recorded from sperm, killer, long-finned pilot, Blainville's beaked and Cuvier's beaked whales before and during exposure to low- (1-2 kHz) and mid- (2-7 kHz) frequency active sonar were used to estimate the changes in blood and tissue N2 tension (PN2 ). Our objectives were to determine if differences in (1) dive behavior or (2) physiological responses to sonar are plausible risk factors for bubble formation. The theoretical estimates indicate that all species may experience high N2 levels. However, unexpectedly, deep diving generally result in higher end-dive PN2 as compared with shallow diving. In this focused review we focus on three possible explanations: (1) We revisit an old hypothesis that CO2, because of its much higher diffusivity, forms bubble precursors that continue to grow in N2 supersaturated tissues. Such a mechanism would be less dependent on the alveolar collapse depth but affected by elevated levels of CO2 following a burst of activity during sonar exposure. (2) During deep dives, a greater duration of time might be spent at depths where gas exchange continues as compared with shallow dives. The resulting elevated levels of N2 in deep diving whales might also make them more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. (3) Extended duration of dives even at depths beyond where the alveoli collapse could result in slow continuous accumulation of N2 in the adipose tissues that eventually becomes a liability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24478724/,2022-11-28 03:00:48 AM
Effect of Water Amount Intake before Scuba Diving on the Risk of Decompression Sickness,"Kil-Hyung Han, Gwang-Suk Hyun, Yong-Seok Jee, Jung-Min Park, Kil-Hyung Han, Gwang-Suk Hyun, Yong-Seok Jee, Jung-Min Park",2021 Jul 16,"Background and objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of pre-hydration levels on circulating bubble formation for scuba divers and to evaluate the appropriate volume of water intake for reducing the risk of decompression sickness (DCS). Materials and Methods: Twenty scuba divers were classified into four groups according to the volume of water taken in before scuba diving as follows: no-water-intake group (NWIG), 30%-water-intake group (30WIG), 50%-water intake group (50WIG), and 100%-water-intake group (100WIG). We measured the circulating bubbles using movement status by Doppler on the right and left subclavian veins and precordial regions at pre-dive, post-dive, and 30 min after diving to a depth of 30 m for a duration of 25 min at the bottom. Results: Participants belonging to the 30WIG showed the lowest frequency, percentage, and amplitude of bubbles and consequently the lowest bubble grade in the left and right subclavian veins and precordial region at post-time and 30 min after diving. Conclusions: It can be inferred that pre-hydration with 30% of the recommended daily water intake before scuba diving effectively suppressed the formation of bubbles after diving and decreased the risk of DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34300051/,2022-11-28 03:00:49 AM
Risk perception in small-scale fishers and hyperbaric personnel: A risk assessment of hookah diving,"Oswaldo Huchim-Lara, Juan Carlos Seijo, Oswaldo Huchim-Lara, Juan Carlos Seijo",2018 May-Jun,"Hookah diving is a fishing method used in many small-scale fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, as well as in many coastal fisheries around the world. Many high-value species like sea cucumber and spiny lobster, among others, are harvested via hookah diving. However, the fishing method presents a risk for both decompression illness and carbon monoxide poisoning, both causes of disabilities and death among small-scale fishers, and with significant negative impacts on the social and economic status of households and coastal communities. Currently, there is a misunderstanding among fishers concerning diving risks. Using a mixed-method analysis, this study reports the risk perceptions of small-scale fishers and hyperbaric personnel about hookah diving, and the actual diving accidents which occur in the spiny lobster and sea cucumber fisheries in the Yucatán northeastern ports. The study highlights the need for appropriate fishing technologies and increased awareness among fishers about the consequences of hookah diving.

Screening and Risk Stratification Strategy Reduced Decompression Sickness Occurrence in Divers With Patent Foramen Ovale,"Jakub Honěk, Martin Šrámek, Tomáš Honěk, Aleš Tomek, Luděk Šefc, Jaroslav Januška, Jiří Fiedler, Martin Horváth, Štěpán Novotný, Marek Brabec, Josef Veselka, Jakub Honěk, Martin Šrámek, Tomáš Honěk, Aleš Tomek, Luděk Šefc, Jaroslav Januška, Jiří Fiedler, Martin Horváth, Štěpán Novotný, Marek Brabec, Josef Veselka",2022 Feb,"Objectives:
        
      
      This paper sought to evaluate the occurrence of decompression sickness (DCS) after the application of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) screening and risk stratification strategy.
    


          Background:
        
      
      PFO is associated with an increased risk of DCS. Recently, transcatheter closure was reported to reduce DCS occurrence in divers with a high-grade shunt. However, to date, there are no data regarding the effectiveness of any PFO screening and risk stratification strategy for divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 829 consecutive divers (age 35.4 ± 10.0 years, 81.5% men) were screened for PFO by means of transcranial color-coded sonography in the DIVE-PFO (Decompression Illness Prevention in Divers with a Patent Foramen Ovale) registry. Divers with a high-grade PFO were offered either catheter-based PFO closure (the closure group) or advised conservative diving (high grades). Divers with a low-grade shunt were advised conservative diving (low grades), whereas those with no PFO continued unrestricted diving (controls). A telephone follow-up was performed. To study the effect of the screening and risk stratification strategy, DCS occurrence before enrollment and during the follow-up was compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Follow-up was available for 748 (90%) divers. Seven hundred and 2 divers continued diving and were included in the analysis (mean follow-up 6.5 ± 3.5 years). The DCS incidence decreased significantly in all groups, except the controls. During follow-up, there were no DCS events in the closure group; DCS incidence was similar to the controls in the low-grade group (HR: 3.965; 95% CI: 0.558-28.18; P = 0.169) but remained higher in the high-grade group (HR: 26.170; 95% CI: 5.797-118.160; P < 0.0001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The screening and risk stratification strategy using transcranial color-coded sonography was associated with a decrease in DCS occurrence in divers with PFO. Catheter-based PFO closure was associated with a DCS occurrence similar to the controls; the conservative strategy had a similar effect in the low-grade group, but in the high-grade group the DCS incidence remained higher than in all other groups.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34419390/,2022-11-28 03:00:51 AM
Diving beyond Aerobic Limits: Effect of Temperature on Anaerobic Support of Simulated Predator Avoidance Dives in an Air-Breathing Ectotherm,"Essie M Rodgers, Craig E Franklin, Essie M Rodgers, Craig E Franklin",2019 May/Jun,"Diving optimality models predict air breathers to routinely dive within aerobic limits, but predator avoidance dives may be an exception. Lengthening submergence times during a predation threat may enhance survival probability, and we therefore hypothesized that predator avoidance dives in juvenile estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) would be partially anaerobically fueled. We also predicted that reliance on anaerobic metabolism would increase at elevated temperatures to offset the faster depletion of body oxygen stores. Crocodiles were maintained at 28° and 34°C for 60 d and subsequently underwent simulated predator avoidance dive trials at two test temperatures (28° and 34°C). Blood was sampled immediately on surfacing to measure plasma lactate concentrations relative to nondiving (control) values. Aerobic dive limits (cADL; min) were also calculated using known body mass and oxygen storage relationships and rates of diving oxygen consumption and compared with observed dive durations. Postdive plasma lactate levels were elevated beyond resting levels at both test temperatures, indicating that aerobic thresholds were surpassed during simulated predator avoidance dives. Similarly, ≥90% of dive durations exceeded cADLs at both test temperatures. Postdive plasma lactate concentrations were independent of water temperature and thermal acclimation treatment. Together, these findings suggest that reliance on anaerobiosis during simulated predator avoidance dives is important regardless of temperature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864880/,2022-11-28 03:00:51 AM
Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder prevalence among commercial divers in South Africa,"Charles H Van Wijk, W A Jack Meintjes, Charles H Van Wijk, W A Jack Meintjes",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with increased chance of workplace accidents, psychiatric comorbidities, other risky behaviours and sophisticated psychopharmacological treatment. These factors all contribute to a potentially complex risk profile within the commercial diving context. In order to make informed decisions regarding ADHD and commercial diving, further description of this condition among commercial divers is required. This paper reports on a study that aimed to determine the prevalence of adult ADHD among commercial divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study used a self-reporting survey-type questionnaire to determine likely diagnosis, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. criteria, in a group of 245 commercial divers in South Africa.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fourteen cases (5.7% of the sample) met criteria for ADHD. The majority of the cases presented with combined type, and reflected mild forms of ADHD. Adult ADHD did not appear to occur in significantly different proportions across the biographical variables of age, education or diving qualification.
    


          Conlcusion:
        
      
      Based on this small survey, adult ADHD may be over-represented in commercial diving in South Africa, compared to general workplace populations. However, ADHD may not necessarily be a contra-indication to commercial diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557419/,2022-11-28 03:00:52 AM
Spinal Cord Injury With Tetraplegia in Young Persons After Diving Into Shallow Water: What Has Changed in the Past 10 to 15 Years?,"Christopher Ull, Emre Yilmaz, Oliver Jansen, Sebastian Lotzien, Thomas A Schildhauer, Mirko Aach, Matthias Königshausen, Christopher Ull, Emre Yilmaz, Oliver Jansen, Sebastian Lotzien, Thomas A Schildhauer, Mirko Aach, Matthias Königshausen",2021 Oct,"Study design:
        
      
      Retrospective, monocentric, observational study in a tertiary health care center.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To analyze prehospital and clinical findings, complications, neurological improvement and follow-up in a young person cohort with spinal cord injury (SCI) and tetraplegia according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) A to D after diving into shallow water.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Included were all persons younger than 50 years with SCI after head-first diving into shallow water between June 2001 and June 2019. All persons with SCI were divided into complete tetraplegia (AIS A) and incomplete tetraplegia (AIS B, C, and D) to test differences.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 59 males (98.7%) and 1 female with a mean age of 27.7 years suffered an SCI. Alcohol use was documented in 25 cases (41.7%). At the time of admission, 33 people (55%) showed a complete tetraplegia (AIS A) and 27 showed an incomplete tetraplegia with 8 AIS B (13.3%), 15 AIS C (25%), and 4 AIS D (6.7%). At the time of discharge, people with initially complete tetraplegia showed a significant improvement from admission to discharge (P ≤ .004). Persons with incomplete tetraplegia were more likely to improve their neurological status compared with complete tetraplegia patients (P ≤ .001). Especially persons with complete tetraplegia suffered from typical SCI-related problems and complications.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      People with SCI and tetraplegia at the time admission show neurological improvement in 50% of the cases with an overall better outcome in persons with incomplete tetraplegia. The surgical treatment of SCI within 24 hours seems to be associated with a better neurological outcome and a lower level of tetraplegia. The incidence of SCI caused by diving into shallow water remains stable without a significant change, especially in high-risk groups. More education and prevention programs are necessary to avoid these injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32909818/,2022-11-28 03:00:52 AM
Outcome of Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty in SCUBA Divers,"Omer J Ungar, Oren Cavel, Oron Yahav, Nir Tsur, Ophir Handzel, Omer J Ungar, Oren Cavel, Oron Yahav, Nir Tsur, Ophir Handzel",2020 Jun 18,"Objectives:
        
      
      Good Eustachian tube (ET) function is necessary in order to equalize middle ear (ME) pressure with ambient pressures and avoid barotrauma among divers. Since placement of ventilation tubes is not compatible with diving, balloon eustachian tuboplasty is a potential surgical solution for divers with ET dysfunction (ETD). This is the first report of the outcome of balloon tuboplasty for ETD among divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis of medical records and clinical examinations of adult divers treated in a single tertiary medical center.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four male divers (age range 21-71 years, 5 ETs) underwent balloon tuboplasty for ETD. None had identifiable risk factors for ETD. Symptom duration ranged from 2 to 5 years and was restricted to diving in 3 patients. The most common symptom was difficulties in equalizing air pressure during descent and ascent, followed by aural fullness and hearing loss. The validated Hebrew version of ETD-7 questionnaire (ETDQ-7H) results were normal in 3 ears and pathological (2.9 and 3.3) in 2 ears. The averaged postoperative ETDQ-7H score was 1.2 points, significantly better than the preoperative score (P < .05). While diving, pressure-equalizing sensation improved in all ears.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Balloon eustachian tuboplasty is a safe method for treating diving-induced baro-challenge ETD. This procedure can improve symptoms and enable the patient to resume diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32551960/,2022-11-28 03:00:53 AM
Continuous Hemodynamic Monitoring in an Intact Rat Model of Simulated Diving,"Svein E Gaustad, Timofei V Kondratiev, Ingrid Eftedal, Torkjel Tveita, Svein E Gaustad, Timofei V Kondratiev, Ingrid Eftedal, Torkjel Tveita",2020 Jan 13,"Cardiovascular risk is elevated in divers, but detailed information of cardiac function during diving is missing. The aim of this study was to apply an intact rat model with continuous monitoring of cardiac left ventricular (LV) function in a simulated diving experiment. Thirteen rats were inserted with a LV pressure-volume catheter and a pressure transducer in the femoral artery to measure hemodynamic variables, and randomly assigned to diving (n = 9) and control (n = 4) groups. The diving group was compressed to 600 kPa in air, maintained at pressure for 45 min (bottom phase), and decompressed to surface at 50 kPa/min. Data was collected before, during, and up to 60 min after exposure in the diving group, and at similar times in non-diving controls. During the bottom phase, stroke volume (SV) (-29%) and cardiac output (-30%) decreased, whereas LV end-systolic volume (+13%), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (+29%), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (+72%) increased. There were no changes in LV contractility, stroke work, or diastolic function. All hemodynamic variables returned to baseline values within 60 min after diving. In conclusion, our simulated dive experiment to 600 kPa increased MAP and TPR to levels which caused a substantial reduction in SV and LV volume output. The increase in cardiac afterload demonstrated to take place during a dive is well tolerated by the healthy heart in our model, whereas in a failing heart this abrupt change in afterload may lead to acute cardiac decompensation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31998144/,2022-11-28 03:00:54 AM
Risk Factors for Transverse Ligament Disruption and Vertebral Artery Injury Following an Atlas Fracture,"Michael Cloney, Hyun Kim, Robert Riestenberg, Nader S Dahdaleh, Michael Cloney, Hyun Kim, Robert Riestenberg, Nader S Dahdaleh",2021 Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Atlas fracture occurs in 3%-13% of all cervical spinal injuries and is often associated with other injuries. The factors associated with concomitant transverse ligament disruption and vertebral artery injury remain underexamined.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed 97 consecutive cases of atlas fractures. We analyzed demographic and clinic characteristics, including mechanism of injury, fracture type, and associated injuries. We identified factors independently associated with vertebral artery injury and/or transverse ligament disruption.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On multivariable analysis, vertebral artery injury was independently, positively associated with injury to the transverse ligament (odds ratio [OR], 8.51 [1.17, 61.72], P = 0.034), associated facial injury (OR, 7.78 [1.05, 57.50]; P = 0.045), intoxication at presentation (OR, 51.42 [1.10, 2408.82]; P = 0.045), and negatively associated with type 3 fractures (OR, 0.081 [0.0081, 0.814]; P = 0.033). There was a trend toward a positive association with a violence mechanism of injury (OR, 33.47 [0.75, 1487.89]; P = 0.070). Transverse ligament injury was independently associated with other injuries to the spine (OR, 13.07362 [2.43, 70.28]; P = 0.003), atlantodental interval (OR, 2.63 [1.02, 6.75]; P = 0.045), lateral mass displacement (OR, 1.78 [1.32, 2.39]; P < 0.001), and male sex (OR, 7.07 [1.47, 34.06]; P = 0.015). There was a trend toward a positive association with injury to the vertebral artery (OR, 5.13 [0.96, 27.35]; P = 0.056).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Among patients with atlas fractures, vertebral artery injury and transverse ligament disruption are associated with each other. Mechanism of injury, fracture type, and intoxication at the time of injury were associated with vertebral artery injury, and atlantodental interval and lateral mass displacement are associated with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed injury to the transverse ligament.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33309644/,2022-11-28 03:00:55 AM
Do not fear the Framingham: Practical application to properly evaluate and modify cardiovascular risk in commercial divers,"Rahul Suresh, James Pavela, Marcus S Kus, Tony Alleman, Robert Sanders, Rahul Suresh, James Pavela, Marcus S Kus, Tony Alleman, Robert Sanders",2018 Jan-Feb,"Introduction:
        
      
      In April 2016 the Association of Diving Contractors International (ADCI) consensus guidelines began recommending annual cardiovascular risk stratification of commercial divers using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). For those at elevated risk, further testing is recommended. This approach has raised concerns about potential operational and financial impacts. However, the prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk and need for additional testing among commercial divers is not known.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Clinical data required to calculate the FRS was abstracted for 190 commercial divers in two cohorts. Population demographics, FRS distribution, contributions of risk factors and effect of interventions on reducing risk-factor burden were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean FRS score was 1.68 ± 6.35 points, with 13 divers (6.8%) at intermediate risk and none at high 10-year risk. In these 13 divers, the mean contributions to the FRS were from age (6.5 points), cholesterol (3.1 pts.), smoking (1.3 pts.), highdensity lipoprotein (1 pt.), and systolic blood pressure (0.8 pts). The youngest age group had a significantly higher modifiable risk core than the oldest age group (5.87 vs. 1.2 points, P ⟨ 0.001). All 13 intermediate risk divers could have been reclassified as low-risk with successful treatment of modifiable risk factors.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk among commercial divers is low, and treatment of modifiable risk factors could reclassify those at intermediate risk to low risk. Therefore, FRS implementation coupled with intensive risk-reduction strategies for at risk-divers may help improve diver health and prolong the careers of divers while limiting the need for additional testing and adverse operational impact.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29571235/,2022-11-28 03:00:55 AM
Swimming-induced pulmonary edema: current perspectives,"Ralph Smith, Julian O M Ormerod, Nikant Sabharwal, Courtney Kipps, Ralph Smith, Julian O M Ormerod, Nikant Sabharwal, Courtney Kipps",2018 Jul 27,"With the growing popularity of water-based sports, cases of swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) are becoming increasingly recognized. SIPE, a potentially life-threatening condition, is an acute cause of breathlessness in athletes. It has been described frequently in scuba divers, swimmers, and triathletes and is characterized by symptoms and signs of pulmonary edema following water immersion. It is important to recognize that athletes' symptoms can present with a spectrum of severity from mild breathlessness to severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. In most cases, there is rapid resolution of symptoms within 48 hours of exiting the water. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of SIPE, particularly regarding exaggerated pulmonary vascular pressures, have begun to explain this elusive condition more clearly and to distinguish its predisposing factors. It is essential that event organizers and athletes are aware of SIPE. Prompt recognition is required not only to prevent drowning, but also to implement appropriate medical management and subsequent advice regarding return to swimming and the risk of recurrence. This manuscript provides a current perspective on SIPE regarding the incidence rate, the current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, medical management, recurrence rates, and advice on return to sport.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30100770/,2022-11-28 03:00:56 AM
[Travelling with a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator],"Oliver Przibille, Felix Kristian Weise, Bernd Nowak, Oliver Przibille, Felix Kristian Weise, Bernd Nowak",2019 Jun,"There are no guidelines for patients travelling with implanted pacemakers or defibrillators. Only few publications deal with specific problems that this patient group might face. In this article different aspects of travelling with implanted electric devices are summarized. Patients with pacemakers and implanted defibrillators have nearly no limits when travelling. An exception to that rule is scuba diving, which mostly is limited because of the device. In general it is the underlying heart disease or arrhythmia that limits patients' travel activities. It is reasonable to travel after implantation only after wound healing is complete because arm movement on the implant site is limited and the risk of wound infection and lead dislocation is elevated in the early phase. However, if necessary, flying is possible 2 days after an uncomplicated implantation if pneumothorax can be excluded. Security checks can be passed safely by patients with pacemakers/defibrillators. Only repetitive movement of a handheld metal detector over the device should be avoided. When travelling to different time zones it might be reasonable to deactivate a programmed sleep rate (Medtronic, Biotronik). Patients at risk for ventricular arrhythmia (mainly patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) must make sure to take all possible preventive measures to avoid travelers' diarrhea.

However, this is a poorly studied form of hypoxia, with a knowledge gap on physiological and biochemical adaptation mechanisms. The reflective sympathetic constriction of the resistive vessels is realized via ADRA1A. It has been shown that ADRA1A SNP (p.Arg347Cys; rs1048101) is associated with changes in tonus in vessel walls. Moreover, the Cys347 allele has been shown to regulate systolic blood pressure. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether the ADRA1A polymorphism affected the pulmonary vascular reactions in men and women in response to the diving reflex. Men (n = 52) and women (n = 50) untrained in diving aged 18 to 25 were recruited into the study. The vascular reactions and blood flow were examined by integrated rheography and rheography of the pulmonary artery. Peripheral blood circulation was registered by plethysmography. The ADRA1A gene polymorphism (p.Arg347Cys; rs1048101) was determined by PCR-RFLP. In both men and women, reflective pulmonary vasodilation did occur in response to the diving reflex, but in women this vasodilation was more pronounced and was accompanied by a higher filling of the lungs with blood.. Additionally, ADRA1A SNP (p.Arg347Cys; rs1048101) is associated with sex. Interestingly, women with the Arg347 allele demonstrated the highest vasodilation of the lung vessels. Therefore, our data may help to indicate women with the most prominent adaptive reactions to the diving reflex. Our data also indicate that women and men with the Cys allele of the ADRA1A gene polymorphism have the highest risk of developing lung hypertension in response to the diving reflex. The diving reflex is an oxygen-saving mechanism which is accompanied by apnea, reflex bradycardia development, peripheral vasoconstriction, spleen erythrocyte release, and selective redistribution of blood flow to the organs most vulnerable to lack of oxygen, such as the brain, heart, and lungs.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome increases the risk of drowning,"Frank F Vincenzi, Frank F Vincenzi",2016 Feb,"There is strong evidence linking inherited long QT syndromes with an increased risk of drowning due to fatal arrhythmias in the water. Drug-induced long QT syndrome (DILQTS) is hypothesized to increase the risk of drowning by similar mechanisms. It is suggested that QT prolongation caused by a drug or drugs, when combined with the autonomic conflict associated with the mammalian dive reflex and/or the cold shock reflex, sets up conditions that may result in a sudden fatal arrhythmia while in water - thus an increased risk of drowning related to a drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval.

Sickle cell trait and diving: review and recommendations,"John A Vigilante, Nicholas W DiGeorge, John A Vigilante, Nicholas W DiGeorge",2014 May-Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Sickle cell trait, once thought to be a benign condition, has been associated with complications which may be of concern to the diver, such as splenic infarction and exercise-related sudden death. Medical clearance to dive for those with this common hemoglobinopathy has been a source of debate, with differing recommendations for both civilian and military candidates. To assess this disparity, a review was conducted of published findings and opinions regarding sickle cell trait and fitness to dive.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature search was conducted using PubMed/Medline. Keywords included sickle cell trait, hemoglobinopathy, exercise-related sudden death, decompression sickness, diving, special operations, military. Results that included cases of sickle cell trait were included. Further, current guidelines were ascertained from public institutions, prominent diving texts, and the U.S. Military.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Review of the literature reveals that complications of sickle cell trait are rare, with no reports of corresponding dive-related injury. Analysis of the physiology of diving as it pertains to the condition, as well as the absence of reported cases, suggest there is minimal increased risk in sport and technical civilian diving. Opinion for military fitness to dive is varied.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      As specific circumstances thought to predispose to sickle cell trait complication may be unavoidable in the completion of military duties, diving is not recommended for these individuals. However, recreational and commercial diving using typical precautions seems reasonable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24984317/,2022-11-28 03:01:01 AM
A review of diving practices and outcomes following the diagnosis of a persistent (patent) foramen ovale in compressed air divers with a documented episode of decompression sickness,"Christopher W Scarff, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock, Christopher W Scarff, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      The presence of a persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO) increases the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) whilst diving with pressurised air. After the diagnosis of a PFO, divers will be offered a number of options for risk mitigation. The aim of this study was to review the management choices and modifications to diving practices following PFO diagnosis in the era preceding the 2015 joint position statement (JPS) on PFO and diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective study was conducted of divers sourced from both the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne and the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific during the period 2005-2015. Divers were contacted via a combination of phone, text, mail and email. Data collected included: diving habits (years, style and depths); DCS symptoms, signs and treatment; return to diving and modifications of dive practices; history of migraine and echocardiography (ECHO) pre- and post-intervention; ECHO technique(s) used, and success or failure of PFO closure (PFOC). Analyses were performed to compare the incidence of DCS pre- and post-PFO diagnosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-three divers were interviewed. Sixty-eight of these returned to diving following the diagnosis of PFO. Thirty-eight underwent PFOC and chose to adopt conservative diving practices (CDPs); 15 chose PFOC with no modification to practices; 15 adopted CDPs alone; and five have discontinued diving. The incidence of DCS decreased significantly following PFOC and/or adoption of conservative diving practices. Of interest, migraine with aura resolved in almost all those who underwent PFOC.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Many divers had already adopted practices consistent with the 2015 JPS permitting the resumption of scuba diving with a lowering of the incidence of DCS to that of the general diving population.

The effects of heliox non-saturation diving on the cardiovascular system and cognitive functions,"Dal-Woo Lee, Su-Jeen Jung, Jeong-Sun Ju, Dal-Woo Lee, Su-Jeen Jung, Jeong-Sun Ju",2020 First Quarter,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a single bout of heliox non-saturation diving on the cardiovascular system and cognitive function. Ten recreational scuba divers (10 males, ∼35 years old) participated in this study. These subjects made two pool dives within a one-week interval, alternating gases with compressed air (21% O2, 79% N2) and with heliox (21% O2 and 79% He). The depth was to 26 meters over a 20-minute duration. The results showed that heliox diving significantly increased blood O2 saturation by 1.15% and significantly decreased blood lactate levels by ∼57% when compared with air diving (P ≺ 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in resting heart rate, systolic or diastolic pressure, core body blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity between the heliox and air dives. The Stroop test showed that the heliox dive significantly increased cognitive function compared with the air dive in both the simple test (Offtime) and interference test (Ontime) (P ≺ 0.05). It was concluded that the heliox dive increases blood O2 saturation and decreases blood lactate concentration when compared with air dives. These conditions are likely to help divers reduce hypoxia in the water, reduce the risk of loss of consciousness, reduce fatigue and allow them to dive for longer. Heliox diving may also help judgment and risk coping skills in the water due to the improvement of cognitive ability as compared to air breathing dives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32176950/,2022-11-28 03:01:04 AM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2016 Edition: A report on 2014 data on diving fatalities, injuries, and incidents [Internet]","Peter Buzzacott, Peter Buzzacott",,"In this latest DAN Annual Diving Report we received reports of 50 US recreational diver fatalities occurring in the US in 2014. The Sport and Fitness Industry Association annual participation figures for 2014 estimate that 1.1% of the US population went scuba diving that year, some three million divers, making on average ten dives each. Without knowing how many of those dives were made overseas, and how many dives are made in the US by visiting divers, we cannot say with certainty what the absolute risk of death or injury is while recreational diving.
    

      
      In Brazil, for example, the annual number of fatalities increased from 0.5 per year in the 1990’s, to 1 per year during 2000-2009, to 3 per year 2010-2014. Once again though, it should be remembered that without a reliable denominator we do not know if the absolute number of deaths is increasing in line with increased participation, or if improvements to surveillance are merely identifying a greater proportion of fatalities, or some combination of both.
    

      
      Work continues towards clarifying these uncertainties in the US and around the world. Meanwhile, our preliminary investigations suggest in the US we may end up finding a fatality rate of around two deaths per million recreational dives, and that around one out of every 10,000 Emergency Room (ER) presentations relate to scuba diving. If such a low prevalence reflects what is happening in ERs then it should be no surprise that DAN Medical Services are so often called by receiving physicians around the US. It is not uncommon for physicians to call DAN for advice in evaluating their very first diving injury patient, and DAN is there to assist any receiving physician, to ensure divers receive the most appropriate treatment available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28211666/,2022-11-28 03:01:04 AM
Embryonic background risk promotes the survival of tadpoles facing surface predators,"Adam L Crane, Douglas P Chivers, Maud C O Ferrari, Adam L Crane, Douglas P Chivers, Maud C O Ferrari",2018 Mar 21,"Exposure to intense predation risk can induce morphological and behavioural phenotypes that prepare prey, often at young ages, for surviving attacks from unknown predators. However, previous studies revealed that this survival advantage depended on the predator species. Here, we used alarm cues from injured conspecifics to simulate a period of high predation risk for embryonic wood frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus. Two weeks post-hatching, we tested whether the embryonic risk exposure influenced survival in encounters with two novel predators: (1) a spider (Dolomedes sp.) that ambushes prey exclusively on the surface of the water, and (2) the adult predacious diving beetle (Dytiscus sp.) which displays underwater sit-and-wait posture and pursuit tactics. Tadpoles exposed to embryonic high-risk survived longer when encountering spiders, whereas background risk had no influence on survival with adult beetles. These findings, coupled with survival studies involving other predator types, indicate that a high-risk environment promotes tadpole survival in future encounters with unknown sit-and-wait predators, but at the cost of increased vulnerability to novel predators capable of active pursuit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29561913/,2022-11-28 03:01:05 AM

Influence of Manatees' Diving on Their Risk of Collision with Watercraft,"Holly H Edwards, Julien Martin, Charles J Deutsch, Robert G Muller, Stacie M Koslovsky, Alexander J Smith, Margaret E Barlas, Holly H Edwards, Julien Martin, Charles J Deutsch, Robert G Muller, Stacie M Koslovsky, Alexander J Smith, Margaret E Barlas",2016 Apr 6,"Watercraft pose a threat to endangered Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris). Mortality from watercraft collisions has adversely impacted the manatee population's growth rate, therefore reducing this threat is an important management goal. To assess factors that contribute to the risk of watercraft strikes to manatees, we studied the diving behavior of nine manatees carrying GPS tags and time-depth recorders in Tampa Bay, Florida, during winters 2002-2006. We applied a Bayesian formulation of generalized linear mixed models to depth data to model the probability (Pt) that manatees would be no deeper than 1.25 m from the water's surface as a function of behavioral and habitat covariates. Manatees above this threshold were considered to be within striking depth of a watercraft. Seventy-eight percent of depth records (individual range 62-86%) were within striking depth (mean = 1.09 m, max = 16.20 m), illustrating how vulnerable manatees are to strikes. In some circumstances manatees made consecutive dives to the bottom while traveling, even in areas >14 m, possibly to conserve energy. This is the first documentation of potential cost-efficient diving behavior in manatees. Manatees were at higher risk of being within striking depth in shallow water (<0.91 m), over seagrass, at night, and while stationary or moving slowly; they were less likely to be within striking depth when ≤50 m from a charted waterway. In shallow water the probability of a manatee being within striking depth was 0.96 (CI = 0.93-0.98) and decreased as water depth increased. The probability was greater over seagrass (Pt = 0.96, CI = 0.93-0.98) than over other substrates (Pt = 0.73, CI = 0.58-0.84).

Association Between Arterial Oxygen Saturation and Lung Ultrasound B-Lines After Competitive Deep Breath-Hold Diving,"Alexander Patrician, Frank Pernett, Angelica Lodin-Sundström, Erika Schagatay, Alexander Patrician, Frank Pernett, Angelica Lodin-Sundström, Erika Schagatay",2021 Aug 4,"Breath-hold diving (freediving) is an underwater sport that is associated with elevated hydrostatic pressure, which has a compressive effect on the lungs that can lead to the development of pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema reduces oxygen uptake and thereby the recovery from the hypoxia developed during freediving, and increases the risk of hypoxic syncope. We aimed to examine the efficacy of SpO2, via pulse-oximetry, as a tool to detect pulmonary edema by comparing it to lung ultrasound B-line measurements after deep diving. SpO2 and B-lines were collected in 40 freedivers participating in an international deep freediving competition. SpO2 was measured within 17 ± 6 min and lung B-lines using ultrasound within 44 ± 15 min after surfacing. A specific symptoms questionnaire was used during SpO2 measurements. We found a negative correlation between B-line score and minimum SpO2 (r s = -0.491; p = 0.002) and mean SpO2 (r s = -0.335; p = 0.046). B-line scores were positively correlated with depth (r s = 0.408; p = 0.013), confirming that extra-vascular lung water is increased with deeper dives. Compared to dives that were asymptomatic, symptomatic dives had a 27% greater B-line score, and both a lower mean and minimum SpO2 (all p < 0.05). Indeed, a minimum SpO2 ≤ 95% after a deep dive has a positive predictive value of 29% and a negative predictive value of 100% regarding symptoms. We concluded that elevated B-line scores are associated with reduced SpO2 after dives, suggesting that SpO2 via pulse oximetry could be a useful screening tool to detect increased extra-vascular lung water. The practical application is not to diagnose pulmonary edema based on SpO2 - as pulse oximetry is inexact - rather, to utilize it as a tool to determine which divers require further evaluation before returning to deep freediving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34421654/,2022-11-28 03:01:08 AM

      Breath-hold diving-induced hemoptysis (BH-DIH) has been reported in about 25% breath-hold divers (BHD) and is characterized by dyspnea, coughing, hemoptysis and chest pain. We investigated whether eNOS G894T, eNOS T786C and ACE insertion/deletion I/D genetic variants, are possible BH-DIH risk factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      108 experienced healthy instructor BHDs with the same minimum requirements (102 male, six female; mean age 43.90 ± 7.49) were studied. We looked for different eNOS G894T, eNOS T786C and ACE insertion/ deletion genetic variants between BH-DIH-positive and BH-DIH-negative subjects to identify the variants most frequently associated with BH-DIH.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At least one BH-DIH episode was reported by 22.2% of subjects, while 77.7% never reported BH-DIH. The majority of BH-DIH-positive subjects showed eNOS G894T (p = 0.001) and eNOS-T786C (p = 0.001) genotype ""TT"" (high-risk profile). Prevalence of BH-DIH was higher in subjects with eNOS G894T TT genotype (50%) than in subjects with GT (9.5%, p < 0.001) and GG (24%, (p = 0.0002) genotype (low-risk profile). Similar results were observed for eNOS T786C: BH-DIH prevalence was higher in the TT genotype (41.2%) group than in the CT (15.4%, p < 0.001) and CC genotype (9.1%, p < 0.001) groups. BH-DIH prevalence was significantly higher in subjects showing ACE ID genotype (34.5%) than II (0%, p < 0.001) and DD (10.5%, p = 0.0002). Of the ACE ""II"" genotype group, 100% never developed BH-DIH.

      Ninety percent of the lesions resulting from diving injuries affect the cervical spine and are potentially associated with spinal cord injuries. The objective is to determine the most frequent lesion mechanisms. Evaluate the therapeutic alternatives and the biomechanical evolution (kyphotic deformation) of diving-induced cervical spine injuries. Define epidemiological characteristics of diving injuries.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis over a period of 10 years was undertaken for patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery of Montpellier, France, with cervical spinal injuries due to a diving accident. Patients were re-evaluated and clinical and radiological evaluation follow-ups were done.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This study included 64 patients. Cervical spine injuries resulting from diving predominantly affect young male subjects. They represent 9.5% of all the cervical spine injuries. In 22% of cases, patients presented severe neurological troubles (ASIA A, B, C) at the time of admission. A surgical treatment was done in 85% of cases, mostly using an anterior cervical approach.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from March 2018 to October 2018. In this study, the athletes from Tianjin University of Sports, Tianjin Vocational College of Sports, and Tianjin provincial sports teams were selected for general investigation. In total, 1,673 athletes were invited and 1,413 participated in the study (response rate of 84.5%). Results: In total, 1,413 athletes were enrolled; 151 had suffered from sports-related eye injuries, with an incidence of 10.7% (95% CI: 9.1-12.0%). Handball (38.5%) was the sport with the highest incidence of eye injuries, followed by water polo (36.4%) and diving (26.7%). Overall, 42.4% of the athletes were injured by ball and 22.5% of injuries came from teammates. The eye injuries usually occurred during training (64.2%) and competitions (14.6%). Adnexa wound (51.7%) was the most common type of injury. About 11.9% of the athletes with eye injuries had the impaired vision; 66.7% failed to see doctors on time. The athletes <18 years of age had a higher risk of eye injuries (odds ratio [OR] =1.60, 95% CI: 1.06-2.40). The athletes with lower family income (<1,000 RMB) were at risk population for sports-related eye injuries (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.24-6.82). Training >4 h a day increased the risk of eye injuries (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.42-3.43). Conclusion: The incidence of sports-related eye injuries among athletes was 10.7% in Tianjin, China. Handball, water polo, and diving were the most common activities of injury. Age, family income, and training time were the risk factors for sports-related eye injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34604250/,2022-11-28 03:01:10 AM
Women candidates for diving with oxygen-enriched gas mixtures have a lower end tidal CO2 than men during moderate exercise,"Mirit Eynan, Amir Abramovich, Yehuda Arieli, Mirit Eynan, Amir Abramovich, Yehuda Arieli",2013 Dec 1,"We have previously determined the thresholds for CO2 detection (conscious recognition of elevated CO2) and retention in male divers, beyond which a diving candidate should not continue his diving activity due to an increased risk of CNS oxygen toxicity. The purpose of the present study was to establish whether there is a difference in end tidal PCO2 between male and female divers who use oxygen-enriched gas mixtures. Ventilatory and perceptual responses to variations in inspired CO2 (range 0-42 mm Hg) were assessed during moderate exercise in 18 males and 18 females. End tidal PCO2 was lower in the female divers when breathing oxygen with 42 mm Hg CO2 (58.2±3.0 mm Hg vs. 61.5±4.5 mm Hg, P<0.03). These results suggest that female divers have a lower end tidal CO2 than males when breathing a hyperoxic gas mixture during exercise, which might imply that women are less susceptible to CNS oxygen toxicity than men.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911589/,2022-11-28 03:01:11 AM
Pulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch: a novel hypothesis for how diving vertebrates may avoid the bends,"Daniel Garcia Párraga, Michael Moore, Andreas Fahlman, Daniel Garcia Párraga, Michael Moore, Andreas Fahlman",2018 Apr 25,"Hydrostatic lung compression in diving marine mammals, with collapsing alveoli blocking gas exchange at depth, has been the main theoretical basis for limiting N2 uptake and avoiding gas emboli (GE) as they ascend. However, studies of beached and bycaught cetaceans and sea turtles imply that air-breathing marine vertebrates may, under unusual circumstances, develop GE that result in decompression sickness (DCS) symptoms. Theoretical modelling of tissue and blood gas dynamics of breath-hold divers suggests that changes in perfusion and blood flow distribution may also play a significant role. The results from the modelling work suggest that our current understanding of diving physiology in many species is poor, as the models predict blood and tissue N2 levels that would result in severe DCS symptoms (chokes, paralysis and death) in a large fraction of natural dive profiles. In this review, we combine published results from marine mammals and turtles to propose alternative mechanisms for how marine vertebrates control gas exchange in the lung, through management of the pulmonary distribution of alveolar ventilation ([Formula: see text]) and cardiac output/lung perfusion ([Formula: see text]), varying the level of [Formula: see text] in different regions of the lung. Man-made disturbances, causing stress, could alter the [Formula: see text] mismatch level in the lung, resulting in an abnormally elevated uptake of N2, increasing the risk for GE. Our hypothesis provides avenues for new areas of research, offers an explanation for how sonar exposure may alter physiology causing GE and provides a new mechanism for how air-breathing marine vertebrates usually avoid the diving-related problems observed in human divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695441/,2022-11-28 03:01:11 AM
Primary Familial and Congenital Polycythemia,"Celeste Bento, Mary Frances McMullin, Melanie Percy, Holger Cario, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Celeste Bento, Mary Frances McMullin, Melanie Percy, Holger Cario, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) is characterized by isolated erythrocytosis in an individual with a normal-sized spleen and absence of disorders causing secondary erythrocytosis. Clinical manifestations relate to the erythrocytosis and can include plethora, the hyperviscosity syndrome (headache, dizziness, fatigue, lassitude, visual and auditory disturbances, paresthesia, myalgia), altered mental status caused by hypoperfusion and local hypoxia, and arterial and/or venous thromboembolic events. Although the majority of individuals with PFCP have only mild manifestations of hyperviscosity such as dizziness or headache, some affected individuals have had severe and even fatal complications including arterial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, deep vein thrombosis, coronary disease, and myocardial infarction. To date 116 affected individuals from 24 families have been reported.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of PFCP is established in a proband with isolated erythrocytosis (hemoglobin and hematocrit above the normal reference range when adjusted for age and sex), normal hemoglobin oxygen affinity measured as P50, erythropoietin (EPO) serum level below or in the lower normal range for laboratory-specific reference values, and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis of PFCP can be confirmed in 12%-15% of individuals with these findings by detection of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in EPOR by molecular genetic testing.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: No management guidelines have been published. While the majority of individuals with PFCP require no regular treatment, some undergo phlebotomy to either treat symptoms of the hyperviscosity syndrome or to maintain the hematocrit at an almost normal level. Some patients require antihypertensive therapy. While low-dose aspirin can be considered for the prevention of thromboembolic events, no evidence of efficacy exists.
    

Prevention of primary manifestations: Maintain good hydration and avoid activities that potentially increase blood viscosity (e.g., mountain climbing, scuba diving, smoking). For those at increased risk for thromboembolic events: take precautions in higher-risk situations such as long-distance airline flights
    

Surveillance: Regular cardiology assessment including cardiac function (echocardiography) and blood pressure measurement. Life-long assessment for manifestations/severity of hyperviscosity syndrome and investigation of any suspicious clinical events such as thromboembolic complications.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration; activities that could increase blood viscosity (mountain climbing, scuba diving, smoking)
    

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis is warranted in relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from education about agents and circumstances to avoid including inappropriate treatments.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      PFCP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an individual with PFCP has a 50% chance of inheriting the EPOR pathogenic variant. Once the EPOR pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for PFCP are possible; note, however, that molecular genetic test results cannot predict disease onset or severity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27831681/,2022-11-28 03:01:12 AM
Energy cost and optimisation in breath-hold diving,"M Trassinelli, M Trassinelli",2016 May 7,"We present a new model for calculating locomotion costs in breath-hold divers. Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag, the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into account the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion transformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the corresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them with observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings (Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a reduction in the risk of decompression sickness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26896829/,2022-11-28 03:01:13 AM
Decompression and decompression sickness,"Richard T Mahon, David P Regis, Richard T Mahon, David P Regis",2014 Jul,"The ever-present desire of humankind to explore new limits introduced us to the syndrome of decompression sickness (DCS). This broad overview of DCS is aimed at its pathophysiology and basics of therapeutic strategies. After a brief explanation of decompression theory, historical vignettes will serve to inform the practical application of our increasing understanding of DCS risks. The pathophysiology, current practices, role of bubble monitoring, risk factors, and potential long-term effects of DCS are also discussed. The goal is to explain the current state of DCS understanding in the context of a robust observational and empirical history. However, DCS remains a syndrome consisting of a constellation of symptoms following a change in ambient pressure. Though great strides have been made, significant knowledge gaps remain. If the coming years advance the field even a fraction of what its predecessors accomplished, the health and safety of those who endeavor in the environment of changing pressures most certainly will be improved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24944033/,2022-11-28 03:01:13 AM
Eccentric exercise 48 h prior to simulated diving has no effect on vascular bubble formation in rats,"Arve Jørgensen, Anna Ekdahl, Marianne B Havnes, Ingrid Eftedal, Arve Jørgensen, Anna Ekdahl, Marianne B Havnes, Ingrid Eftedal",2015 Mar,"Purpose:
        
      
      Decompression sickness (DCS) caused by vascular bubble formation is a major risk when diving. Prior studies have shown that physical exercise has a significant impact in both reducing and increasing bubble formation. There is limited knowledge about the mechanisms, but there are indications that exercise-induced muscle injury prior to diving may cause increased bubble formation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of exercise-induced muscle injury as a possible mechanism of bubble formation during diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Muscle injury was induced by exposing female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 30) to a single bout of eccentric exercise, 100 min intermittent, downhill (-16°) treadmill running. Forty-eight hours later, the animals were exposed to a 50-min simulated saturation dive (709 kPa) in a pressure chamber, when the degree of muscle injury and inflammation would be the most pronounced. Bubble formation after the dive was observed by ultrasonic imaging for 4 h.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No difference in bubble loads was found between the groups at any time despite evident muscle injury. Maximum bubble loads (bubbles cm(-2) heart cycle(-1)) were not different, exercise: 1.6 ± 3.5 SD vs control: 2.2 ± 4.1 SD, P = 0.90, n = 15 in each group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Eccentric exercise performed 48 h prior to diving causes skeletal muscle injury but does not increase the amount of vascular bubbles in rats. The prevailing recommendation is that physical activity prior to diving is a risk factor of DCS. However, present and previous studies implicate that pre-dive physical activity does not increase the DCS risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25394809/,2022-11-28 03:01:14 AM
Cardiovascular changes during SCUBA diving: an underwater Doppler echocardiographic study,"C Marabotti, A Scalzini, D Menicucci, M Passera, R Bedini, A L'Abbate, C Marabotti, A Scalzini, D Menicucci, M Passera, R Bedini, A L'Abbate",2013 Sep,"Aim:
        
      
      Body immersion induces blood redistribution (from peripheral to intrathoracic vessels) and is a powerful autonomic stimulus (activating both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems). For these reasons, concerns have been raised about the safety of diving for subjects with previous heart disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular changes occurring during recreational SCUBA diving, as assessed by underwater Doppler echocardiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eighteen healthy experienced divers underwent a 2D Doppler echocardiography basally, during two 15' steps of still SCUBA diving at different depths (10 m followed by 5 m) and shortly after the end of immersion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During dive, left ventricular (LV) diastolic volume and early left ventricular filling significantly increased (5 m vs. basal: P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), while both deceleration time of the early filling rate and late diastolic filling velocity significantly decreased (5 m and 10 m dive vs. basal: P < 0.01). LV volume increase and diastolic filling changes persisted at postdive evaluation, where a significant decrease in heart rate was also observed (P < 0.01 as compared to basal, 5-m and 10-m dive).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study documents that shallow-depth SCUBA diving induces LV enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. Direct underwater evaluation by Doppler echocardiography could be an appropriate tool for unmasking subjects at risk for underwater-related accidents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23638629/,2022-11-28 03:01:15 AM
Fear of Killer Whales Drives Extreme Synchrony in Deep Diving Beaked Whales,"Natacha Aguilar de Soto, Fleur Visser, Peter L Tyack, Jesús Alcazar, Graeme Ruxton, Patricia Arranz, Peter T Madsen, Mark Johnson, Natacha Aguilar de Soto, Fleur Visser, Peter L Tyack, Jesús Alcazar, Graeme Ruxton, Patricia Arranz, Peter T Madsen, Mark Johnson",2020 Feb 6,"Fear of predation can induce profound changes in the behaviour and physiology of prey species even if predator encounters are infrequent. For echolocating toothed whales, the use of sound to forage exposes them to detection by eavesdropping predators, but while some species exploit social defences or produce cryptic acoustic signals, deep-diving beaked whales, well known for mass-strandings induced by navy sonar, seem enigmatically defenceless against their main predator, killer whales. Here we test the hypothesis that the stereotyped group diving and vocal behaviour of beaked whales has benefits for abatement of predation risk and thus could have been driven by fear of predation over evolutionary time. Biologging data from 14 Blainville's and 12 Cuvier's beaked whales show that group members have an extreme synchronicity, overlapping vocal foraging time by 98% despite hunting individually, thereby reducing group temporal availability for acoustic detection by killer whales to <25%. Groups also perform a coordinated silent ascent in an unpredictable direction, covering a mean of 1 km horizontal distance from their last vocal position. This tactic sacrifices 35% of foraging time but reduces by an order of magnitude the risk of interception by killer whales. These predator abatement behaviours have likely served beaked whales over millions of years, but may become maladaptive by playing a role in mass strandings induced by man-made predator-like sonar sounds.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32029750/,2022-11-28 03:01:16 AM
The Influence of Physical Activity on Cavernous Malformation Hemorrhage,"Nycole K Joseph, Shivram Kumar, Giuseppe Lanzino, Kelly D Flemming, Nycole K Joseph, Shivram Kumar, Giuseppe Lanzino, Kelly D Flemming",2020 Apr,"Background and aim:
        
      
      Cavernous malformations are low-flow vascular malformations of the central nervous system. Brainstem location and prior hemorrhage increase future hemorrhage risk. We sought to determine the influence of physical activity on hemorrhage risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive patients with radiologically confirmed cavernous malformations participated in a prospective registry with structured, baseline interviews, surveys, and examinations. Patients were asked about unusual events prior to initial clinical presentation. Medical records and MRIs were reviewed. Patients were surveyed about their physical activity after receiving their diagnosis. Annual follow-up surveys to patients ascertained new hemorrhages. Follow-up terminated at last follow-up, hemorrhage, surgery, or death. Univariate analysis assessed the risk of physical activities on prospective hemorrhage.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 195 patients, 117 (60%) were female. Median diagnosis age was 41 years. After diagnosis, 103 (52.8%) patients returned the physical activity survey (cerebral n = 100; spine n = 3). Over 539.4 patient years, 23 had a prospective hemorrhage. Five patients were removed from analysis because they had less than 6 weeks of physical-activity exposure before censor. The remaining 98 had no difference in prospective hemorrhage risk than those patients participating greater than or equal to 3 times monthly in walking, running, greater than 20-pound or less than 20-pound weight lifting, or noncontact sports. Few (n = 5) reported contact-sport participation, scuba diving (n = 2), or high-altitude climbing (n = 1) greater than 3 times monthly.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Aerobic activity and noncontact sports do not increase hemorrhage risk in cerebral cavernous malformation; patients should not be restricted. Less is known about contact sports, high-altitude climbing, scuba diving, and those with spinal-cord cavernous malformation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32147026/,2022-11-28 03:01:17 AM
Using Underwater Pulse Oximetry in Freediving to Extreme Depths to Study Risk of Hypoxic Blackout and Diving Response Phases,"Eric Mulder, Erika Schagatay, Arne Sieber, Eric Mulder, Erika Schagatay, Arne Sieber",2021 Apr 1,"Deep freediving exposes humans to hypoxia and dramatic changes in pressure. The effect of depth on gas exchange may enhance risk of hypoxic blackout (BO) during the last part of the ascent. Our aim was to investigate arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) in shallow and deep freedives, central variables, which have rarely been studied underwater in deep freediving. Four male elite competitive freedivers volunteered to wear a newly developed underwater pulse oximeter for continuous monitoring of SpO2 and HR during self-initiated training in the sea. Two probes were placed on the temples, connected to a recording unit on the back of the freediver. Divers performed one ""shallow"" and one ""deep"" constant weight dive with fins. Plethysmograms were recorded at 30 Hz, and SpO2 and HR were extracted. Mean ± SD depth of shallow dives was 19 ± 3 m, and 73 ± 12 m for deep dives. Duration was 82 ± 36 s in shallow and 150 ± 27 s in deep dives. All divers desaturated more during deeper dives (nadir 55 ± 10%) compared to shallow dives (nadir 80 ± 22%) with a lowest SpO2 of 44% in one deep dive. HR showed a ""diving response,"" with similar lowest HR of 42 bpm in shallow and deep dives; the lowest value (28 bpm) was observed in one shallow dive. HR increased before dives, followed by a decline, and upon resurfacing a peak after which HR normalized. During deep dives, HR was influenced by the level of exertion across different diving phases; after an initial drop, a second HR decline occurred during the passive ""free fall"" phase. The underwater pulse oximeter allowed successful SpO2 and HR monitoring in freedives to 82 m depth - deeper than ever recorded before. Divers' enhanced desaturation during deep dives was likely related to increased exertion and extended duration, but the rapid extreme desaturation to below 50% near surfacing could result from the diminishing pressure, in line with the hypothesis that risk of hypoxic BO may increase during ascent. Recordings also indicated that the diving response is not powerful enough to fully override the exercise-induced tachycardia during active swimming. Pulse oximetry monitoring of essential variables underwater may be an important step to increase freediving safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33868018/,2022-11-28 03:01:17 AM
Hyperbaric Physics,"Mark W. Jones, Kaighley Brett, Nathaniel Han, H Alan Wyatt, Mark W. Jones, Kaighley Brett, Nathaniel Han, H Alan Wyatt",,"Hyperbaric medicine or hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves using high concentrations of oxygen (100%) at pressures greater than the surrounding ambient atmospheric pressure. This necessitates using a pressurized chamber where a single patient (monoplace) or several patients (multi-place) can be placed to facilitate treatment. Undersea medicine refers to the field of medicine concerned with humans in an undersea environment, such as divers, submariners, or caisson workers.
    

History


      
      The first documented usage of hyperbaric medical therapy was in 1662. A British physician created the ""domicillium"" which consisted of a pressurized airtight chamber in which pressure could be increased using a bellows. Numerous afflictions were treated with unknown results. It is interesting to note that this was done before Boyle confirmed the relationship between volume and pressure of gases in the 1670s, the actual discovery of oxygen in 1774 by Joseph Priestly, or the development of Dalton’s and Henry’s laws of gases in the early 1800s. In 1872 Paul Bert researched and wrote about the physiological effects of pressurized air on the human body; the effects of Central Nervous System Oxygen Toxicity is also referred to as the “Paul Bert Effect”. This was followed by research by J Lorrain Smith into Pulmonary Oxygen Toxicity, also known as the “Lorrain Smith Effect.” In 1877 Fontaine built the first mobile hyperbaric operating theatre. In 1891 Dr J.L. Corning built the first North American hyperbaric chamber in New York, completing extensive hyperbaric research looking at its treatment feasibility with many conditions such as syphilis, arthritis, diabetes, and other afflictions. In 1928 he built a ""hyperbaric hotel"" in Cleveland Ohio that could accommodate more than 70 guests.
    

      
      In 1908 Dr John Scott Haldane created the first decompression model based on inert gas uptake and saturation of tissues. World War II prompted the need for acceptable treatment modalities for treating Navy divers who suffered decompression sickness or the “Bends”. Detailed Navy dive charts and hyperbaric treatment tables were formulated for various diving and decompression scenarios. Interestingly the use of pressurized oxygen in the treatment of Decompression Sickness was not introduced until the 1930s by Behnke and Shaw. Research into the use of HBOT increased in the 1950s. One of the most famous studies “Life Without Blood” was published in 1959 by Dr. Ite Boerema who showed that he could keep swine alive using HBOT despite hemoglobin levels that would not normally be compatible with life. After draining all of their red blood cells, a plasma or plasma-like solution was used as volume replacement, which was hyperoxygenated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At the end of the treatment, they were reinfused with blood and recovery was uneventful. The use of HBOT has continued to be researched to the present day. 
    

GENERAL PHYSICS


Light


      
      The physics of light applies primarily to the undersea environment. Attenuation may occur due to absorption as light energy is converted to thermal energy; the red spectrum is absorbed first with blues absorbed last. This is why underwater pictures often appear blue! Diffusion may also occur as light is scattered secondary to interaction with substances in the water. Refraction of light occurs when the path of the light wave is altered due to a change in media. This occurs underwater when a diver is wearing a mask due to the interface between the surrounding water and the airspace within the mask. This results in objects being perceived as larger and closer than they truly are.
    

Sound


      
      In the air, the localization of sound relies on the time delay between the sound wave being received between an individual’s ears. The velocity of sound is approximately 4 times faster in water as compared to air; as the time delay between ears is significantly reduced or lost, it is very difficult to localize sound underwater. The transmission of sound is also reduced due to the spreading and attenuation of the sound wave underwater.
    

Buoyancy


      
      Archimedes’ principle refers to the fact that any object partially or fully immersed in a liquid is buoyed up by a force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by said object. An object that weighs less than the weight of the fluid it displaces while immersed would be positively buoyant or “float”. An object is neutrally buoyant (neither sinking nor floating) when its weight is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. An object will be negatively buoyant or “sink” if it weighs more than the weight of the fluid it displaces.
    

      
      For example, a trained diver will balance the buoyancy of their body and wetsuit with a set amount of weights in order to achieve neutral buoyancy underwater. However, if they take a deep inspiration underwater (expanding their chest cavity), they will now displace more water and become positively buoyant. When they exhale and displace less water, they will return to neutral buoyancy or become negatively buoyant.
    

      
      As the buoyant force refers to the mass of the fluid displaced, density (mass/volume) impacts buoyancy. As such, saltwater, which is denser than freshwater, results in increased buoyancy compared to freshwater
    

Thermal


      
      Wet suits, typically neoprene, provide thermal protection to a diver by insulating a layer of water that has been warmed by the body. Drysuits are aptly named as they allow a diver’s body to remain dry; they are composed of waterproof material with seals at the hands, feet, and neck.
    

      
      Hypothermia may be a concern for divers as water has high thermal conductivity. This is of particular concern on deep dives, or dives in cold water. Divers may use thicker wet suits, drysuits, or hot water suits depending on the dive depth/duration, and temperature of the water.
    

      
      In addition, heat loss occurs due to breathing dry and cold compressed air. As the body must warm and humidify this air in the respiratory tract, there is both evaporative heat loss (humidifying) and convective heat loss (warming). In addition to protective clothing, divers may require warmed breathing gas if hypothermia is a concern. 
    

PRESSURE


      
      Pressure (P=F/A) is the force exerted on a surface per unit area.
    

Atmospheric Pressure


      
      On land, every creature is exposed to atmospheric pressure as a result of the weight of the atmosphere producing a force on the earth’s surface. As gas is compressible, pressure changes with altitude are curvilinear; with increased pressure closer to the earth’s surface, and decreased pressure experienced as you increase altitude. At approximately 18,000 feet, one would experience half the atmospheric pressure compared to standing at sea level.
    

      
      Helpful conversions: surface atmospheric pressure 1 atmosphere (atm) = 760 mm Hg = 1.013 bar = 760 torr = 14.7 psi.
    

Hydrostatic Pressure


      
      Immersion in water results in additional pressure due to the weight of the water exerting a force on the diver. As water is practically incompressible, there is an increase of 1 atm of pressure for every 33 feet of seawater (fsw)/10 meters seawater (msw), or 34 feet of freshwater (ffw)/10.3 meters freshwater (mfw) [remember salt water is denser than fresh water]. It is important to note that while the increase in pressure is a linear relationship (additional 1 atm of pressure for every 10msw), the relative pressure change is curved. For example: moving from surface to 10msw, the total pressure is increased from 1 ata to 2 ata, a relative 200% increase. Moving from 10msw to 20msw, the total pressure increases from 2 ata to 3 ata a relative increase of 150%. Moving from 20msw to 30msw the total pressure increases from 3 ata to 4 ata, a relative increase of 133%. Because of this, there are greater relative pressure changes underwater near the surface, which has implications for barotrauma and buoyancy.
    

      
      Gauge pressure refers to the pressure relative to atmospheric; thus most pressure gauges used by divers will read 0 at surface level.
    

      
      Due to the hydrostatic pressure, immersion results in a central redistribution of blood, which may be increased in the case of cold water due to peripheral vasoconstriction. Subsequently, anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) release results in diuresis. As such, divers may be relatively hypovolemic on surfacing after a dive. This fluid deficit may be exacerbated due to breathing the dry compressed gas as the body humidifies the breathing gas in the respiratory tract.
    

Absolute Pressure


      
      When a diver is underwater, they are exposed to the weight of the water column above them as well as the weight of the atmosphere. Absolute pressure refers to the total pressure experienced due to both the atmospheric pressure as well as the hydrostatic pressure. Depending on the country of origin, it is often written as atmospheres (absolute) or ata, or bar (absolute) or bar(a). For example, a diver at 20msw would experience 2 atm of hydrostatic pressure and 1atm of atmospheric pressure, for an absolute pressure of 3 ata. 
    

GAS LAWS


      
      As gases are compressible, they are subject to 3 inter-related factors: volume, pressure, and temperature. It is important to note that absolute pressure and temperature must be used in calculations employing the following gas laws.
    

Charles’ law (V/T = V/T) refers to the fact that the volume of a gas will vary directly with the absolute temperature if pressure is kept constant. If the absolute temperature is increased, the volume of the gas will increase. 
    

Gay-Lussac’s law (P/T = P/T) refers to the fact that the absolute pressure of a gas varies directly with the absolute temperature if the volume is kept constant. An increase in absolute temperature will result in an increase in absolute pressure. 
    

Boyle’s law (PV=PV) is an extremely important law to understand in hyperbaric and undersea medicine as it is foundational in the pathophysiology of barotrauma, increased work of breathing at depth, and the use of HBOT. If the temperature remains constant, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the absolute pressure. If the ambient pressure is increased (i.e. descent in water, recompression in a hyperbaric chamber), then the volume of gas in a gas-filled body space will decrease. If ambient pressure is decreased, then the volume of gas will expand. This may result in barotrauma as described below.
    

      
      Work of breathing in a hyperbaric chamber or underwater is also of concern. As the volume of gas decreases with increased ambient pressure, its density (mass/volume) increases. Combined with the central redistribution of blood due to immersion, as well as the breathing equipment itself (demand valve, flow resistance, dead space), the work of breathing will be increased as compared to breathing the same gas at surface level.


Dalton’s Law (P = P + P + … P) tells us that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures that would be exerted by each gas if it alone occupied the total volume. Thus, the partial pressure of a gas (P = P x %) is the portion of the total pressure of a gas mixture contributed by a single gas. For example, if a diver is breathing a mix of 40% oxygen at 2 ata, the partial pressure of oxygen would be 0.8 ata.
    

Henry’s Law refers to the fact that the amount of gas that will dissolve in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid. An increase in ambient pressure (and thus partial pressure) results in more gas dissolving into the liquid portion of blood and tissues.
    

      
      Boyle’s, Dalton’s and Henry’s law have significant implications in the development of decompression sickness, gas toxicities, as well as the use of HBOT. 
    

BAROTRAUMA


      
      Barotrauma refers to trauma that results due to pressure changes. Any non-vented gas-containing space in the body is susceptible to barotrauma, such as the thorax, middle ear, sinus, intestines. It may also be an issue due to gas-filled spaces in dive equipment such as a dry suit or a mask. As relative pressure/volume changes underwater occur closer to the surface, barotrauma is more likely to occur as divers transit through these shallow waters.
    

      
      Barotrauma of descent/compression (or colloquially a “squeeze”) results from the decrease in gas volume essentially creating a vacuum. Middle ear barotrauma is most commonly encountered in undersea and hyperbaric medicine due to a vacuum created in the middle ear space; if additional air from the nasopharynx is not introduced through the eustachian tube, the vacuum may result in a sensation of pressure or pain, fluid extravasation/hemorrhage, tympanic membrane perforation, or transmitted damage to the inner ear.
    

      
      Barotrauma on ascent results from gas expansion due to decreasing ambient pressure. This is particularly concerning if compressed air within a gas-filled space cannot escape. For example, if compressed air in the lungs is prevented from escaping (gas trapping, bronchospasm, breath-holding etc.), as the gas continues to expand, focal shearing between vessels and airways and/or rupture of small airways/alveoli may occur. This may result in pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumopericardium, or arterial gas embolism. 
    

DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS


      
      Due to the increase in ambient pressure at depth, there is an increase in the amount of gas that dissolves into the liquid portion of the blood and tissues (on-gassing) when divers breathe compressed gas underwater. Inert gases, particularly nitrogen, are often a component of these gas mixtures and the body does not metabolize these gases. As such, they must be removed as they come out of solution (off-gassing).
    

      
      When a diver ascents (decrease ambient pressure) this inert gas will come out of solution. If the ascent is slow enough, the inert gas diffuses from the tissue into the blood and is filtered out by the lungs. However, if the ambient pressure is decreased too rapidly, bubbles may form within tissues or the vasculature, resulting in what is termed Decompression Sickness (DCS). Once bubbles form, they cause mechanical damage to tissues and endothelium, obstruction of blood flow. These bubbles interact with formed elements within the blood resulting in inflammatory and pro-coagulant reactions.
    

      
      The full pathophysiology of DCS remains unclear and is beyond the scope of this article. What is known is that the on-gassing/off-gassing of tissues is impacted by the pressure gradient between the lungs/blood or blood/tissues, the duration of the dive, the gas mixtures, and the perfusion of the tissues. Some tissues that are very well perfused (lung, blood, brain, heart) may on-gas more readily, but may also off-gas more quickly if perfusion remains constant. Compared to tissues of lower perfusion such as ligaments, tendons, joint capsules who may on-gas more slowly, but may also off-gas more slowly.
    

      
      Dive tables or computers employ mathematical models to predict inert gas on-gassing and off-gassing in order to guide divers on depth and time limits and whether they may need decompression stops (stop underwater to allow additional time to off-gas prior to further decreasing the ambient pressure). It is important to note that these algorithms are based on population data and theoretical inert gas uptake/excretion curves. There are many underlying factors that may impact an individual diver’s susceptibility to DCS, and a diver may develop DCS even if they have followed a dive table or computer 
    

GAS ISSUES IN HYPERBARIC ENVIRONMENT


      
      Once again, a thorough understanding of physics, and in particular Dalton’s and Henry’s laws, are vital to the underlying pathophysiology of gas toxicities, as well as the choice of a gas mixture for diving or HBOT treatment. A partial pressure of a gas that may be safe on surface may become hazardous at increased ambient pressures. A full description of gas issues is outside the scope of this article, but three specific issues are outlined below to demonstrate the impact of understanding physics as it relates to the hyperbaric environment. The physics and function of HBOT are reviewed in a later section.
    

Oxygen Toxicity


      
      Oxygen toxicity results from breathing oxygen at higher partial pressure. Central Nervous System (CNS) oxygen toxicity is the main concern for divers and HBOT; pulmonary oxygen toxicity may become an issue with extended dive operations or HBOT. Oxygen toxicity is dose-dependent based on the partial pressure of oxygen and duration of exposure.
    

      
      Symptoms of CNS oxygen toxicity can include vision changes, tinnitus/auditory hallucinations, nausea, twitching/tremors, irritability or mood changes, dizziness, and convulsions. The risk of CNS oxygen toxicity is increased at a partial pressure of oxygen greater than 1.6 ata underwater, although a higher partial pressure is tolerated in resting and dry conditions like HBOT. There is significant inter- and intrapersonal variability in the presentation of CNS oxygen toxicity.
    

      
      Pulmonary oxygen toxicity typically results from longer, lower pressure exposures and includes a recognizable pattern of an insidious onset of mild substernal irritation or chest tightness progressing to cough, then constant burning exacerbated by inspiration, to shortness of breath (on exertion and then at rest).
    

Inert Gas Narcosis


      
      Inert gas narcosis is a reversible depression of neuronal excitability due to breathing inert gas at higher partial pressure. Clinical presentation can include decreasing cognitive and manual performance, euphoria, overconfidence, memory loss, perceptual narrowing, and impaired sensory functioning. Nitrogen narcosis is most commonly seen in recreational diving; onset varies but can be seen around 30msw or deeper. 
    

Gas Contaminants


      
      Defective compressors used to fill diving tanks or compressors in poorly ventilated areas may cause exhaust fumes or oil vapors to contaminate the breathing gas. For example, a trace amount of Carbon Monoxide for which an individual would be asymptomatic at surface level, may become a lethal dose at deeper depths due to its increased partial pressure. CO disrupts oxygen delivery through its competitive binding of hemoglobin, inhibits mitochondrial respiration, and incites inflammatory effects. Clinical presentation may range from nausea and headache, to potentially fatal arrhythmias, loss of consciousness, or death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28846268/,2022-11-28 03:01:18 AM
Diving and long-term cardiovascular health,"K Åsmul, Å Irgens, M Grønning, A Møllerløkken, K Åsmul, Å Irgens, M Grønning, A Møllerløkken",2017 Jul 1,"Background:
        
      
      Short-term cardiovascular effects from ambient pressure exposure are known. However, long-term cardiovascular effects from diving in humans have been less studied.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To examine possible long-term cardiovascular health effects from occupational diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We compared the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in former divers to non-divers. We obtained data on male former divers with a certificate valid for professional diving after 1980, from the Norwegian Diver 2011 project, and matched data on the general male population from the HUNT3 Survey. We also compared former divers with high and low grades of diving exposure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data were available on 768 former divers. The prevalence of self-reported high blood pressure in former divers who often omitted a dive-free day after 3 days of strenuous diving was 28% compared with 18% in those who rarely violated these regulations [relative risk (RR) 1.47, confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.15]. Also, the prevalence of myocardial infarction/angina pectoris was 11% in divers with >150 professional dives/year compared with 4% in divers with ≤50 professional dives/year [RR adj. 2.91 (CI 1.23-6.87)] and 16% in divers with >2000 air dives in total relative to 3% in divers with ≤2000 dives [RR adj. 3.05 (CI 1.47-6.34)].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The prevalence of some cardiovascular symptoms and diseases may be higher in male former divers than in the general population. Diving might have adverse long-term cardiovascular effects. Whether this is associated with diving per se or strenuous physical activity requires further studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28525588/,2022-11-28 03:01:19 AM
Evaluation of fatal diving accidents in Turkey,"Eylem Koca, Bulent Sam, Nadir Arican, Akin Toklu, Eylem Koca, Bulent Sam, Nadir Arican, Akin Toklu",2019 Nov-Dec,"In any kind of diving there is a risk of accidents, as the move from the topside environment to underwater can affect a diver’s physiological and psychological condition. It is important to investigate dive accidents to clarify the causative factors and determine preventive measures. In this study, autopsy files of fatal dive accident cases were reviewed to evaluate demographic data, type of diving, purpose of dive, seasonal distribution, autopsy findings, and causes of death. We reviewed 56 fatal dive accident files from autopsy units in cities where dive activities are concentrated and from the archive of the Turkish Underwater Federation. Four cases were excluded from the study since we were unable to obtain autopsy reports. Of 52 cases there were 20 scuba divers, two surface-supplied divers and 30 breath-hold divers. The majority of cases involved males (94%). The average age of 50 cases was 38.6; age estimation for two cases could not be determined due to advanced putrefaction. Of these fatal dive accidents 75% took place over a period of six months between May and October. Drowning was recorded as the primary cause of death in these cases. X-ray imaging was used in four (8%) cases. A special autopsy technique was used for nine (17%) cases, to detect possible pulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism. The forensic specialist who is planning to conduct the autopsy for a dive fatality should have knowledge and experience about dive physics and physiology as well as physiopathology of dysbaric injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31166684/,2022-11-28 03:01:20 AM
Heart rate profiles and heart rate variability during scuba diving,"Claudine Schaller, Andrea Fümm, Simon Bachmann, Luca Oechslin, Yoshi Nakahara, Roger Melliger, Patric Biaggi, Christophe Alain Wyss, Claudine Schaller, Andrea Fümm, Simon Bachmann, Luca Oechslin, Yoshi Nakahara, Roger Melliger, Patric Biaggi, Christophe Alain Wyss",2021 Oct 21,"Aims:
        
      
      The aim of the present study was to describe heart rate profiles and heart rate variability patterns in non-selected scuba divers of different ages under non-experimental real-world conditions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used specially designed silver-loaded polydimethylsiloxane dry electrodes for underwater ECG recordings. With a custom-built setup, heart rate profiles and heart rate variability patterns were documented before submersion, during diving and after resurfacing in 18 separate dives.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Heart rates of the divers just before descent were remarkably high (median 114 bpm, interquartile range [IQR] 83-154) with a statistically significant rapid decrease after submersion (median 90 bpm, IQR 70-116; p = 0.008). The percentage heart rate reduction by submersion was individually very variable (median 21%, range 5-39%). We noted a general increase in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity without predominance of parasympathetic parameters, suggesting a concomitant sympatheticadrenergic activation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Scuba diving under real-world conditions by non-selected divers is characterised by relatively high heart rates just before submersion, an individually variable but significant bradycardic dive response, and induces an immediate and sustained parallel increase of parasympathetic and sympathetic-adrenergic autonomic nervous system activity. These observations could explain several specific pathophysiological mechanisms of diving incidents (haemodynamic decompensation, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes) and underlines the importance of cardiovascular risk stratification in diving eligibility assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34694102/,2022-11-28 03:01:20 AM
Persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO): implications for safe diving,"Peter Germonpré, Peter Germonpré",2015 Jun,"Diving medicine is a peculiar specialty. There are physicians and scientists from a wide variety of disciplines with an interest in diving and who all practice 'diving medicine': the study of the complex whole-body physiological changes and interactions upon immersion and emersion. To understand these, the science of physics and molecular gas and fluid movements comes into play. The ultimate goal of practicing diving medicine is to preserve the diver's health, both during and after the dive. Good medicine starts with prevention. For most divers, underwater excursions are not a professional necessity but a hobby; avoidance of risk is generally a much better option than risk mitigation or cure. However, prevention of diving illnesses seems to be even more difficult than treating those illnesses. The papers contained in this issue of DHM are a nice mix of various aspects of PFO that divers are interested in, all of them written by specialist doctors who are avid divers themselves. However, diving medicine should also take advantage of research from the ""non-diving"" medicine community, and PFO is a prime example. Cardiology and neurology have studied PFO for as long, or even longer than divers have been the subjects of PFO research, and with much greater numbers and resources. Unexplained stroke has been associated with PFO, as has severe migraine with aura. As the association seems to be strong, investigating the effect of PFO closure was a logical step. Devices have been developed and perfected, allowing now for a relatively low-risk procedure to 'solve the PFO problem'. However, as with many things in science, the results have not been as spectacular as hoped for: patients still get recurrences of stroke, still have migraine attacks. The risk-benefit ratio of PFO closure for these non-diving diseases is still debated. For diving, we now face a similar problem. Let there be no doubt that PFO is a pathway through which venous gas emboli (VGE) can arterialize, given sufficiently favourable circumstances (such as: a large quantity of VGE, size of the PFO, straining or provocation manoeuvres inducing increased right atrial pressure, delayed tissue desaturation so that seeding arterial gas emboli (AGE) grow instead of shrink, and there may be other, as yet unknown factors). There is no doubt that closing a PFO, either surgically or using a catheter-delivered device, can reduce the number of VGE becoming AGE. There is also no doubt that the procedure itself carries some health risks which are, at 1% or higher risk of serious complications, an order of magnitude greater than the risk for decompression illness (DCI) in recreational diving. Scientists seek the 'truth', but the truth about how much of a risk PFO represents for divers is not likely to be discovered nor universally accepted. First of all, the exact prevalence of PFO in divers is not known. As it has been pointed out in the recent literature, a contrast echocardiography (be it transthoracic or transoesophageal) or Doppler examination is only reliable if performed according to a strict protocol, taking into account the very many pitfalls yielding false negative results. The optimal procedure for injection of contrast medium was described several years ago, but has not received enough attention. Indeed, it is our and others' experience that many divers presenting with PFO-related DCI symptoms initially are declared ""PFO-negative"" by eminent, experienced cardiologists! Failing a prospective study, the risks of diving with a right-to left vascular shunt can only be expressed as an 'odds ratio', which is a less accurate measure than is 'relative risk'. The DAN Europe Carotid Doppler Study, started in 2001, is nearing completion and will provide more insight into the actual risks of DCI for recreational divers. The degree of DCI risk reduction from closing a PFO is thus not only dependent on successful closure but also (mostly?) on how the diver manages his/her dive and decompression in order to reduce the incidence of VGE. It has been convincingly shown that conservative dive profiles reduce DCI incidence even in divers with large PFOs, just as PFO closure does not protect completely from DCI if the dive profiles are aggressive. Prospective studies should not only focus on the reduction of DCI incidence after closure, but should take into account the costs and side effects of the procedure, as has been done in the cardiology and neurology studies. Imagine lung transplants becoming a routine operation, costly but with a high success rate; imagine also a longterm smoker suffering from a mild form of obstructive lung disease and exercise-limiting dyspnoea. Which of two options would you recommend: having a lung transplant and continue smoking as before, or quit smoking and observe a progressive improvement of pulmonary and cardiac pathology? As opposed to patients with thrombotic disease and migraine, divers can choose to reduce DCI risk. In fact, all it takes is acceptance that some types of diving carry too high a health risk - whether it is because of a PFO or another 'natural' factor. It would be unethical to promote PFO closure in divers solely on the basis of its efficacy of shunt reduction. Unfortunately, at least one device manufacturer has already done so in the past, citing various publications to specifically target recreational divers. Some technical diving organizations even have recommended preventive PFO closure in order to undertaking high-risk dive training. As scientists, we must not allow ourselves to be drawn into intuitive diver fears and beliefs. Nor should we let ourselves be blinded by the ease and seemingly low risk of the procedure. With proper and objective information provided by their diving medicine specialist, divers could make an informed decision, rather than focus on the simplistic idea that they need 'to get it fixed' in order to continue diving. A significant relationship between PFO and cerebral damage, in the absence of high-risk diving or DCI, has yet to be confirmed. Studying PFO-related DCI provides us with unique opportunities to learn more about the effect of gas bubbles in various tissues, including the central vascular bed and neurological tissue. It may also serve to educate divers that safe diving is something that needs to be learned, not something that can be implanted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165526/,2022-11-28 03:01:21 AM

Ten-year Spanish cohort of diving-related injuries in a non-hyperbaric tertiary hospital on the Spanish Mediterranean coast,"Victor Garcia-Bustos, Marta Dafne Cabañero-Navalón, Victor Garcia-Bustos, Marta Dafne Cabañero-Navalón",2021 Fourth Quarter,"Introduction:
        
      
      Global evidence on the epidemiology of prevalent diving-related injuries (DRI) different from decompression sickness (DCS) and other fatalities is lacking. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive review of DRIs in the year-period between 2010-2020 in a non-hyperbaric tertiary hospital in the Spanish Mediterranean coast, in addition to identifying patient risk factors for severe middle ear barotrauma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was conducted via a retrospective review of medical records during a 10-year period (2010-2020) at the University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe (UPHLF) of Valencia. We performed a case-control study recruiting controls through an online survey to identify independent predictors for severe middle ear barotrauma.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 68 patients with DRI attended the emergency department of our tertiary referral hospital. Barotrauma accounted for more than 80% of DRI, followed by unrecognized DCS and animal-related injuries. Most patients required neither hospital admission nor surgery; appropriate treatment could be carried out largely on an outpatient basis. The presence of subsequent sequelae was minimal. Previous presence of significant ear, nose and throat (ENT) comorbidities (OR 3.05 - CI 95% 1.11 - 8.35), and older age (OR of younger age 0.94 - CI 95% 0.91 - 0.98) were identified as independent risk factors for severe middle ear barotrauma, with an acceptable discrimination capacity (AUC 0.793, 95% CI 0.71 - 0.87).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The incidence of DRI may be higher than previously thought, and the need to know their epidemiology, their associated morbidity, and the deficiencies of the diving management system is becoming steadily important in order to develop prevention, diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in non-hyperbaric hospitals of these regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34847301/,2022-11-28 03:01:22 AM
Diving At Altitude,"Marc Robins, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie, Marc Robins, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie",,"Increased popularity in recreational scuba diving adds to an ongoing category of diving-related injuries and illnesses. Whether recreational or occupational, scuba, or surfaced supplied air, diving at higher altitudes may compound inherent risks. An individual initiating a dive at altitude is exposed to an atmospheric pressure less than sea level pressure, which is the presumed endpoint for standard decompression tables. However, upon surfacing, the decreased atmospheric pressure in the environment exerts an increased “decompression stress” on the diver. This is often thought of as a relative increase in probabilistic risk for decompression illness in proportion to the diminishment in atmospheric pressure. Under this assumption, the best approximations may translate risk equal to that experienced by the diver surfacing from a depth deeper than actually achieved. These calculations determine a new ""equivalent depth"" for a diver to record bottom time, duration, decompression stops if needed, surface intervals, and residual nitrogen load for repetitive dives to reduce his or her overall risk for decompression illness. Adjusting a dive profile at altitude to an equivalent depth assumes the diver is at risk equal to a sea-level dive; however, other environmental effects inherent to the altitude may also factor in additional risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29630202/,2022-11-28 03:01:23 AM
Diving medicine in clinical practice,"Lars Eichhorn, Dieter Leyk, Lars Eichhorn, Dieter Leyk",2015 Feb 27,"Background:
        
      
      Diving is a popular sport, and some recreational divers have medical risk factors. Their health can be endangered by high extracorporeal (ambient) pressure and its many systemic effects.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We review relevant publications on free (breath-hold) diving, scuba diving, medical evaluation for diving, barotrauma, decompression sickness, and diving with medical risk factors, which were retrieved by a selective search of PubMed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Free diving or scuba diving, even at seemingly innocuous depths, puts considerable stress on the cardio - vascular system, ears, and lungs. Unexpected events while diving, diminished functional reserve, and pre-existing medical illnesses increase the risk of a diving accident. An international survey revealed that minor incidents occur in 1.3% of all dives, and decompression accidents in 2 of every 10 000 dives. A properly conducted medical examination to determine diving fitness, followed by appropriate counseling, can make a life-threatening diving accident less likely.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To be able to certify diving fitness and give competent medical advice about diving, physicians must be well informed about the physical and physiological changes of diving and the associated risks to health, and they need to know how to perform a medical evaluation of prospective divers. In Germany, any licensed physician may judge a person fit to dive. It is recommended that this be done in adherence to the relevant evaluation standards and recommendations of the medical specialty associations. Randomized controlled trials on the effect of preventive behavior would be desirable, as would a central registry of diving accidents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25797514/,2022-11-28 03:01:24 AM
Argon used as dry suit insulation gas for cold-water diving,"Xavier Ce Vrijdag, Pieter-Jan Am van Ooij, Robert A van Hulst, Xavier Ce Vrijdag, Pieter-Jan Am van Ooij, Robert A van Hulst",2013 Jun 3,"Background:
        
      
      Cold-water diving requires good thermal insulation because hypothermia is a serious risk. Water conducts heat more efficiently compared to air. To stay warm during a dive, the choice of thermal protection should be based on physical activity, the temperature of the water, and the duration of exposure. A dry suit, a diving suit filled with gas, is the most common diving suit in cold water. Air is the traditional dry suit inflation gas, whereas the thermal conductivity of argon is approximately 32% lower compared to that of air. This study evaluates the benefits of argon, compared to air, as a thermal insulation gas for a dry suit during a 1-h cold-water dive by divers of the Royal Netherlands Navy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seven male Special Forces divers made (in total) 19 dives in a diving basin with water at 13 degrees C at a depth of 3 m for 1 h in upright position. A rubber dry suit and woollen undergarment were used with either argon (n = 13) or air (n = 6) (blinded to the divers) as suit inflation gas. Core temperature was measured with a radio pill during the dive. Before, halfway, and after the dive, subjective thermal comfort was recorded using a thermal comfort score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No diver had to abort the test due to cold. No differences in core temperature and thermal comfort score were found between the two groups. Core temperature remained unchanged during the dives. Thermal comfort score showed a significant decrease in both groups after a 60-min dive compared to baseline.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In these tests the combination of the dry suit and undergarment was sufficient to maintain core temperature and thermal comfort for a dive of 1h in water at 13 degrees C. The use of argon as a suit inflation gas had no added value for thermal insulation compared to air for these dives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24438580/,2022-11-28 03:01:25 AM
"Oxygen, the lung and the diver: friends and foes?","Pieter-Jan A M van Ooij, Peter J Sterk, Robert A van Hulst, Pieter-Jan A M van Ooij, Peter J Sterk, Robert A van Hulst",2016 Dec,"Worldwide, the number of professional and sports divers is increasing. Most of them breathe diving gases with a raised partial pressure of oxygen (PO2 ). However, if the PO2 is between 50 and 300 kPa (375-2250 mmHg) (hyperoxia), pathological pulmonary changes can develop, known as pulmonary oxygen toxicity (POT). Although in its acute phase, POT is reversible, it can ultimately lead to non-reversible pathological changes. Therefore, it is important to monitor these divers to prevent them from sustaining irreversible lesions.This review summarises the pulmonary pathophysiological effects when breathing oxygen with a PO2 of 50-300 kPa (375-2250 mmHg). We describe the role and the limitations of lung function testing in monitoring the onset and development of POT, and discuss new techniques in respiratory medicine as potential markers in the early development of POT in divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27903670/,2022-11-28 03:01:25 AM
Primary headaches in scuba divers and the effect of temporomandibular dysfunction,"Bengü Altunan, Bengü Altunan",2021 Apr 1,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of episodic primary headaches (EPH) and temporomandibular dysfunction's (TMD) effect in experienced scuba divers.Methods: A form consisting of the Fonseca Anamnestic Index and a structured headache questionnaire was sent to individuals using social media platforms.Results: A total of 132 divers and 104 non-divers were included the study. In male divers, EPH and TMD were not different from the non-diver group (p = 0.1, p = 0.1), and TMD had an effect on increasing the possibility of migraine (OR = 2.5, p = 0.04). In female divers, the possibility of EPH and TMD were also lower (OR = 0.1, p < 0.001, OR = 0.2, p = 0.01).Conclusion: Scuba diving does not pose a risk for EPH or TMD in either gender. TMD treatment in male divers is important for uncontrolled migraine attacks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794749/,2022-11-28 03:01:26 AM
Lifestyle-Associated Risk Factors for Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Carriage in the Netherlands: An Exploratory Hospital-Based Case-Control Study,"Miranda M L van Rijen, Marjolein F Q Kluytmans-van den Bergh, Erwin J M Verkade, Peter B G Ten Ham, Beth J Feingold, Jan A J W Kluytmans, CAM Study Group, Miranda M L van Rijen, Marjolein F Q Kluytmans-van den Bergh, Erwin J M Verkade, Peter B G Ten Ham, Beth J Feingold, Jan A J W Kluytmans, CAM Study Group",2013 Jun 19,"Background:
        
      
      Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is rapidly increasing. Currently, it is unknown which reservoirs are involved. An exploratory hospital-based case-control study was performed in sixteen Dutch hospitals to identify risk factors for CA-MRSA carriage in patients not belonging to established risk groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cases were in- or outpatients from sixteen Dutch hospitals, colonised or infected with MRSA without healthcare- or livestock-associated risk factors for MRSA carriage. Control subjects were patients not carrying MRSA, and hospitalised on the same ward or visited the same outpatients' clinic as the case. The presence of potential risk factors for CA-MRSA carriage was determined using a standardised questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Regular consumption of poultry (OR 2⋅40; 95% CI 1⋅08-5⋅33), cattle density per municipality (OR 1⋅30; 95% CI 1⋅00-1⋅70), and sharing of scuba diving equipment (OR 2⋅93 95% CI 1⋅19-7⋅21) were found to be independently associated with CA-MRSA carriage. CA-MRSA carriage was not related to being of foreign origin.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The observed association between the consumption of poultry and CA-MRSA carriage suggests that MRSA in the food chain may be a source for MRSA carriage in humans. Although sharing of scuba diving equipment was found to be associated with CA-MRSA carriage, the role played by skin abrasions in divers, the lack of decontamination of diving materials, or the favourable high salt content of sea water is currently unclear. The risk for MRSA MC398 carriage in areas with a high cattle density may be due to environmental contamination with MRSA MC398 or human-to-human transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to determine the absolute risks of MRSA acquisition associated with the factors identified.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23840344/,2022-11-28 03:01:27 AM
Estimated workload intensity during volunteer aquarium dives,"P Buzzacott, J W Grier, J Walker, C M Bennett, P J Denoble, P Buzzacott, J W Grier, J Walker, C M Bennett, P J Denoble",2019 May 25,"Background:
        
      
      This study aimed to characterize the physiological demands of working dives on volunteer divers at a public aquarium in the USA.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To estimate the workloads associated with volunteer dives in a US aquarium.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants completed a medical and diving history questionnaire. Measurements included blood pressure before and after diving and continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring during diving. Dive profiles were recorded using loggers. Mean workload was estimated from total air consumption.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-seven divers recorded 49 air dives over 5 days. Two-thirds were male and ages ranged from 40 to 78 years. Typically, each diver made two dives with a 30-60 min surface interval. Mean heart rate while diving was 100 beats per minute (bpm). Mean estimated workload during the dives recorded during this study was 5.8 metabolic equivalents (METS), with a range from 4.1 to 10.5. The highest mean recorded heart rate was 120 bpm over 40 min, vacuuming the floor in the shark exhibit.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Given the mean age of this sample and the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (body mass index, high cholesterol and hypertension), it may be prudent for aquariums to regularly monitor SAC/kg and heart rate in volunteer divers, to identify which tasks require the highest workload intensity. Divers with existing cardiovascular risk factors might then be employed in dives with lighter workloads. In conclusion, volunteer dives at this aquarium required a mean workload intensity that was described by recreational divers as moderate. The highest workload, at 10 METS for 23 min, would be considered by many recreational divers as exhausting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30917197/,2022-11-28 03:01:28 AM
Short- and long-term effects of diving on pulmonary function,"Kay Tetzlaff, Paul S Thomas, Kay Tetzlaff, Paul S Thomas",2017 Mar 29,"The diving environment provides a challenge to the lung, including exposure to high ambient pressure, altered gas characteristics and cardiovascular effects on the pulmonary circulation. Several factors associated with diving affect pulmonary function acutely and can potentially cause prolonged effects that may accumulate gradually with repeated diving exposure. Evidence from experimental deep dives and longitudinal studies suggests long-term adverse effects of diving on the lungs in commercial deep divers, such as the development of small airways disease and accelerated loss of lung function. In addition, there is an accumulating body of evidence that diving with self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) may not be associated with deleterious effects on pulmonary function. Although changes in pulmonary function after single scuba dives have been found to be associated with immersion, ambient cold temperatures and decompression stress, changes in lung function were small and suggest a low likelihood of clinical significance. Recent evidence points to no accelerated loss of lung function in military or recreational scuba divers over time. Thus, the impact of diving on pulmonary function largely depends on factors associated with the individual diving exposure. However, in susceptible subjects clinically relevant worsening of lung function may occur even after single shallow-water scuba dives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28356403/,2022-11-28 03:01:28 AM
The effectiveness of risk mitigation interventions in divers with persistent (patent) foramen ovale,"George Anderson, Douglas Ebersole, Derek Covington, Petar J Denoble, George Anderson, Douglas Ebersole, Derek Covington, Petar J Denoble",2019 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO) is a recognized risk for decompression sickness (DCS) in divers, which may be mitigated by conservative diving or by PFO closure. Our study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these two risk mitigation interventions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a prospective study on divers who tested positive for PFO or an atrial septal defect (ASD) and either decided to continue diving without closure ('conservative group'), or to close their PFO/ASD and continue diving ('closure group'). Divers' characteristics, medical history, history of diving and history of DCS were reported at enrollment and annually after that. The outcome measures were the incidence rate of DCS, frequency and intensity of diving activities, and adverse events of closure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Divers in both groups dived less and had a lower incidence rate of confirmed DCS than before the intervention. In the closure group (n = 42) the incidence rate of confirmed DCS decreased significantly. Divers with a large PFO experienced the greatest reduction in total DCS. In the conservative group (n = 23), the post-intervention decrease in confirmed DCS incidence rate was not significant. Of note, not all divers returned to diving after closure. Seven subjects reported mild adverse events associated with closure; one subject reported a serious adverse event.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PFO closure should be considered on an individual basis. In particular, individuals who are healthy, have a significant DCS burden, a large PFO or seek to pursue advanced diving may benefit from closure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177513/,2022-11-28 03:01:29 AM
Diving and mental health: the potential benefits and risks from a survey of recreational scuba divers,"Marguerite St Leger Dowse, Ben Whalley, Matthew K Waterman, Robert M Conway, Gary R Smerdon, Marguerite St Leger Dowse, Ben Whalley, Matthew K Waterman, Robert M Conway, Gary R Smerdon",2019 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      Scuba diving is physically and cognitively demanding. Medical guidance regarding physical and mental health (MH) issues and related prescribed medication is often based on limited evidence. There is a paucity of data concerning diving with MH issues. This survey aimed to investigate the prevalence of MH issues and use of prescription medications among United Kingdom (UK) sport divers, and the rate of non-compliance with current guidance among divers suffering depression and anxiety. The positive effects of scuba diving on MH were also considered.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An anonymous online survey was publicised through diving exhibitions and social media. Measures included diver and diving demographics; GAD-7 Anxiety and PHQ-9 depression questionnaires; diagnosed current and/or past MH conditions; medication usage; comorbid medical conditions/treatments; disclosure of past/current MH issues; and perceived MH benefits of diving.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data from 729 respondents revealed MH issues at rates comparable with the general population. Current and/or past MH issues were reported by 111/729, with 60 having active diagnoses, and 45/60 taking prescribed psychotropic medications; 21/45 did not declare their medication on diver self-certification medical forms. The activity of diving was thought to be beneficial to MH by 119/729 respondents.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Divers experienced expected levels of MH issues, but did not comply with current medical guidelines on modifying or abstaining from diving activity or reporting their MH condition. Changes may be needed to diver training to encourage more accurate reporting and aid development of evidence-based protocols. Guidelines could be reconsidered in light of current diver behaviour, risks and potential MH benefits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31828748/,2022-11-28 03:01:30 AM
Flying after diving: in-flight echocardiography after a scuba diving week,"Danilo Cialoni, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni, Danilo Cialoni, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni",2014 Oct,"Introduction:
        
      
      Flying after diving may increase decompression sickness risk (DCS), but strong evidence indicating minimum preflight surface intervals (PFSI) is missing.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      On return flights after a diving week on a live-aboard, 32 divers were examined by in-flight echocardiography with the following protocol: 1) outgoing flight, no previous dive; 2) during the diving week; 3) before the return flight after a 24-h PFSI; and 4) during the return flight.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All divers completed similar multiple repetitive dives during the diving week. All dives were equivalent as to inert gas load and gradient factor upon surfacing. No bubbles in the right heart were found in any diver during the outgoing flight or at the preflight control after a 24-h PFSI following the diving week. A significant increase in the number and grade of bubbles was observed during the return flight. However, bubbles were only observed in 6 of the 32 divers. These six divers were the same ones who developed bubbles after every dive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Having observed a 24-h preflight interval, the majority of divers did not develop bubbles during altitude exposure; however, it is intriguing to note that the same subjects who developed significant amounts of bubbles after every dive showed equally significant bubble grades during in-flight echocardiography notwithstanding a correct PFSI. This indicates a possible higher susceptibility to bubble formation in certain individuals, who may need longer PFSI before altitude exposure after scuba diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25245898/,2022-11-28 03:01:30 AM
Cardiovascular Concerns in Water Sports,"Alfred A Bove, Alfred A Bove",2015 Jul,"The cardiac effects of aquatic sports have increased in interest with the experience of cardiac responses to swimming and diving. The syndrome of swimming-induced pulmonary edema is likely caused by a combination of central blood shifts, sudden onset of high exercise demands, and impaired diastolic relaxation of the left ventricle. Divers also develop venous gas emboli caused by nitrogen supersaturation in blood and tissues during ascent from depth. The physiology and physics of water immersion and diving are unique. Knowledge of pressure effects, gas solubility, and changes in gas volumes with depth is needed to understand the disorders related to these activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26100421/,2022-11-28 03:01:31 AM
Breathing through a diving snorkel; theory and experiment of air flow resistance and cost of breathing,"N A M Schellart, N A M Schellart",2021 First Quarter,"The snorkel allows a surface swimmer to observe the underwater world through the face mask without being disturbed by inhaling. The effect of a snorkel on breathing resistance and cost is widely held to be substantial. This study aims to model these parameters and to measure indirectly the actual increases. Further, resistances of differing designs and dimensions were assessed and recommendations were made concerning use and choice. Maximal voluntary ventilation in 12 seconds (MVV12) was measured in 19 volunteers seated on dry land with and without a classic J-type snorkel (inner diameter 20.5 mm). The extra and total resistances and costs were calculated using the MVV12 data and using estimated airways resistance extrapolated from subject's demography and spirometric literature data. MVV12 measurements with snorkel showed a minute volume of 152 ±38 L∙min-1, 6.0 ±3.7% lower than without snorkel (p = 7.0x10-6). The theoretical MVV12, calculated from snorkel and airways resistances, decreased by 3.2%. Experimental total breathing resistance (457±83 Pa∙s∙L-1) was 6.5 ± 3.2% higher than without snorkel (p = 2.6x10-7), but the total mechanical breathing cost was unaffected by the snorkel (13.58 Watts with; 13.64 Watts without). Divers' estimations of resistance increase were exaggerated (8.8% at rest, 23% swimming). Classical J-type snorkels with an inner diameter ≥19.5 mm add 3-16% resistance . There is no risk of hypercapnia. Scuba divers are recommended to use their snorkel to breathe more comfortably on the surface. It is recommended the snorkel be made a mandatory safety accessory. The best multipurpose snorkel (19-21 mm) has no top appendages and no water release valve.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33648037/,2022-11-28 03:01:32 AM
The transition from day-to-night activity is a risk factor for the development of CNS oxygen toxicity in the diurnal fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus),"Mirit Eynan, Adi Biram, Michael Mullokandov, Noga Kronfeld-Schor, Rotem Paz-Cohen, Dvir Menajem, Yehuda Arieli, Mirit Eynan, Adi Biram, Michael Mullokandov, Noga Kronfeld-Schor, Rotem Paz-Cohen, Dvir Menajem, Yehuda Arieli",2017,"Performance and safety are impaired in employees engaged in shift work. Combat divers who use closed-circuit oxygen diving apparatus undergo part of their training during the night hours. The greatest risk involved in diving with such apparatus is the development of central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT). We investigated whether the switch from day-to-night activity may be a risk factor for the development of CNS-OT using a diurnal animal model, the fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus). Animals were kept on a 12:12 light-dark schedule (6 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 500 lx). The study included two groups: (1) Control group: animals were kept awake and active during the day, between 09:00 and 15:00. (2) Experimental group: animals were kept awake and active during the night, between 21:00 and 03:00, when they were exposed to dim light in order to simulate the conditions prevalent during combat diver training. This continued for a period of 3 weeks, 5 days a week. On completion of this phase, 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) levels in urine were determined over a period of 24 h. Animals were then exposed to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). To investigate the effect of acute melatonin administration, melatonin (50 mg/kg) or its vehicle was administered to the animals in both groups 20 min prior to HBO exposure. After the exposure, the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase was measured, as were the levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and overall nitrotyrosylation in the cortex and hippocampus. Latency to CNS-OT was significantly reduced after the transition from day-to-night activity. This was associated with alterations in the level of melatonin metabolites secreted in the urine. Acute melatonin administration had no effect on latency to CNS-OT in either of the groups. Nevertheless, the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as nitrotyrosine and nNOS levels, were altered in the hippocampus following melatonin administration. On the basis of these results, we suggest that a switch from diurnal to nocturnal activity may represent an additional risk factor for the development of CNS-OT. Utilizing a diurnal animal model may contribute to our understanding of the heightened risk of developing CNS-OT when diving with closed-circuit oxygen apparatus at night.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28156158/,2022-11-28 03:01:33 AM
The impact of different gas mixtures on inflammatory responses in advanced recreational divers,"Monica Rocco, Luigi Maggi, Chiara Loffredo, Massimiliano Pelli, Pia Di Benedetto, Silvia Fiorelli, Maurizio Simmaco, Roberto Alberto De Blasi, Monica Rocco, Luigi Maggi, Chiara Loffredo, Massimiliano Pelli, Pia Di Benedetto, Silvia Fiorelli, Maurizio Simmaco, Roberto Alberto De Blasi",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Decompression sickness (DCS) is considered a 'bubble disease'. Intravascular bubbles activate inflammatory responses associated with endothelial dysfunction. Breathing gas has been proposed as a potential risk factor but this is inadequately studied. Different gases are used in scuba diving. Helium-containing 'trimix' could theoretically mitigate inflammation and therefore reduce DCS risk. This study determined the effect of air and trimix on the inflammatory response following dives to 50 metres of sea water, and evaluated the differences between them in advanced recreational divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Thirty-three divers were enrolled in this observational study and were divided in two groups: 17 subjects were included in the air group, and 16 different subjects were included in the trimix (21% oxygen, 35% helium, 44% nitrogen) group. Each subject conducted a single dive, and both groups used a similar diving profile of identical duration. A venous blood sample was taken 30 min before diving and 2 h after surfacing to evaluate changes in interleukins (IL) IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Interferon γ (IFN-γ), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and epithelial growth factor (EGF) after diving.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No differences were observed between groups in demographic data or diving experience. Following the dive, IL-6 values showed a slight increase, while IL-8 and EGF decreased in both groups, without significant variation between the groups.

SCUBA Diving and Asthma: Clinical Recommendations and Safety,"Christopher A Coop, Karla E Adams, Charles N Webb, Christopher A Coop, Karla E Adams, Charles N Webb",2016 Feb,"The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding asthma and SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed articles related to asthma and SCUBA diving using the following keywords: asthma, allergy, and SCUBA diving. SCUBA diving is a popular sport with more than 9 million divers in the USA. SCUBA diving can be a dangerous sport. Bronchospasm can develop in asthmatic patients and cause airway obstruction. Airway obstruction may be localized to the distal airway which prevents gas elimination. Uncontrolled expansion of the distal airway may result in pulmonary barotrauma. There is also the risk of a gas embolism. Asthmatic divers can also aspirate seawater which may induce bronchospasm. Pollen contamination of their oxygen tank may exacerbate atopic asthma in patients. Diving may be hazardous to the lung function of patients with asthma. Despite the risks of SCUBA diving, many asthmatic individuals can dive without serious diving events. Diving evaluations for asthmatic patients have focused on a thorough patient history, spirometry, allergy testing, and bronchial challenges. For patients that wish to dive, their asthma should be well controlled without current chest symptoms. Patients should have a normal spirometry. Some diving societies recommend that an asthmatic patient should successfully pass a bronchial provocation challenge. Recommendations also state that exercise-, emotion-, and cold-induced asthmatics should not dive. Asthmatic patients requiring rescue medication within 48 h should not dive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25666876/,2022-11-28 03:01:35 AM
Risk of Neurological Insult in Competitive Deep Breath-Hold Diving,"Kay Tetzlaff, Holger Schöppenthau, Jochen D Schipke, Kay Tetzlaff, Holger Schöppenthau, Jochen D Schipke",2017 Feb,"Context:
        
      
      It has been widely believed that tissue nitrogen uptake from the lungs during breath-hold diving would be insufficient to cause decompression stress in humans. With competitive free diving, however, diving depths have been ever increasing over the past decades.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A case is presented of a competitive free-diving athlete who suffered stroke-like symptoms after surfacing from his last dive of a series of 3 deep breath-hold dives. A literature and Web search was performed to screen for similar cases of subjects with serious neurological symptoms after deep breath-hold dives.
    


          Case details:
        
      
      A previously healthy 31-y-old athlete experienced right-sided motor weakness and difficulty speaking immediately after surfacing from a breathhold dive to a depth of 100 m. He had performed 2 preceding breath-hold dives to that depth with surface intervals of only 15 min. The presentation of symptoms and neuroimaging findings supported a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Three more cases of neurological insults were retrieved by literature and Web search; in all cases the athletes presented with stroke-like symptoms after single breath-hold dives of depths exceeding 100 m. Two of these cases only had a short delay to recompression treatment and completely recovered from the insult.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This report highlights the possibility of neurological insult, eg, stroke, due to cerebral arterial gas embolism as a consequence of decompression stress after deep breath-hold dives. Thus, stroke as a clinical presentation of cerebral arterial gas embolism should be considered another risk of extreme breath-hold diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27248853/,2022-11-28 03:01:35 AM
Going to Extremes of Lung Physiology-Deep Breath-Hold Diving,"Kay Tetzlaff, Frederic Lemaitre, Christof Burgstahler, Julian A Luetkens, Lars Eichhorn, Kay Tetzlaff, Frederic Lemaitre, Christof Burgstahler, Julian A Luetkens, Lars Eichhorn",2021 Jul 9,"Breath-hold diving involves environmental challenges, such as water immersion, hydrostatic pressure, and asphyxia, that put the respiratory system under stress. While training and inherent individual factors may increase tolerance to these challenges, the limits of human respiratory physiology will be reached quickly during deep breath-hold dives. Nonetheless, world records in deep breath-hold diving of more than 214 m of seawater have considerably exceeded predictions from human physiology. Investigations of elite breath-hold divers and their achievements revised our understanding of possible physiological adaptations in humans and revealed techniques such as glossopharyngeal breathing as being essential to achieve extremes in breath-hold diving performance. These techniques allow elite athletes to increase total lung capacity and minimize residual volume, thereby reducing thoracic squeeze. However, the inability of human lungs to collapse early during descent enables respiratory gas exchange to continue at greater depths, forcing nitrogen (N2) out of the alveolar space to dissolve in body tissues. This will increase risk of N2 narcosis and decompression stress. Clinical cases of stroke-like syndromes after single deep breath-hold dives point to possible mechanisms of decompression stress, caused by N2 entering the vasculature upon ascent from these deep dives. Mechanisms of neurological injury and inert gas narcosis during deep breath-hold dives are still incompletely understood.

Into the deep blue sea: A review of the safety of recreational diving in people with diabetes mellitus,"Theocharis Koufakis, Spyridon N Karras, Omar G Mustafa, Dimos Karangelis, Pantelis Zebekakis, Kalliopi Kotsa, Theocharis Koufakis, Spyridon N Karras, Omar G Mustafa, Dimos Karangelis, Pantelis Zebekakis, Kalliopi Kotsa",2020 Feb,"People with diabetes, particularly those being insulin treated, have been for many years considered ineligible for diving, because of the high risk of adverse events. Blood glucose levels tend to decline during diving, probably because of changes in insulin requirements and resistance, due to increased physical activity and effects of hyperbaric environment on glucose tolerance. Strict adherence to safety protocols, in conjunction with optimal physical status, lack of diabetic complications (especially impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia) and satisfactory baseline glycaemic control, seem to minimise the risk of complications during diving. The integration of modern technology into diabetes management, providing potential for underwater continuous glucose monitoring, can be useful in optimising metabolic control before, during and after diving. Despite the significant progress been made on safety issues, there is still a need to implement the relevant recommendations into divers' everyday practice. Existing evidence is mainly derived from small studies and there is a wide heterogeneity in terms of study designs and explored outcomes, rendering the extraction of definitive conclusions challenging. The aim of this review is to present and critically evaluate available evidence, use of technology, and gaps in existing knowledge that deserve further evaluation by future studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31013208/,2022-11-28 03:01:37 AM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2019 Edition: A report on 2017 diving fatalities, injuries, and incidents [Internet]","Petar J. Denoble, Petar J. Denoble",,"The format of Edition 2019 is similar to that of previous editions. In Section One, we present 2017 fatality data. At the beginning of this section are summary statistics for fatalities in the U.S. and Canada followed by a series of case studies that offer further insight into causes.
    

      
      This year’s report features enhanced spatial/geographic data. Section Two includes a series of maps of fatal and nonfatal dive-related injuries around the U.S. and the world. For the first time, we have county-level data in Florida and California, the states with the most diving. These popular dive destinations accommodate various scuba diving activities, including wreck diving and underwater harvesting. We are pleased to have reached this level of geospatial analysis and will continue to work with public health officials in these counties for the next 10 years.
    

      
      In Section Three we present the summary statistics of nonfatal injuries, based on data from the DAN Medical Services Call Center, as well as an in-depth review of select cases. Section Four focuses on incident reports, most of which did not involve any injury, provided voluntarily by divers. The breath-hold diving portion of the report follows in Section Five. DAN employs various injury and fatality prevention strategies, so we added a section, Section Six, about training programs, which target individual divers, and hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) programs, which promote operational safety.
    

      
      The addition of enhanced geographic data is a step forward for the report, but there is always more to do. Among the improvements we are considering for the coming years are interactive digital maps of injuries and fatalities, a revamping of the dive incident reporting system, an enhanced coding system for increased granularity, inclusion of diving-adjacent activities (such as topside accidents involving scuba cylinders) and greater coordination with training agencies and other organizations to standardize reporting and capture even more incidents.
    

      
      Our data revealed some interesting themes. For one, cardiovascular disease was present in many of the available autopsy reports. We also noted that fatalities occurred in people of various certification levels and participation frequency and that a significant number of deaths occur at shallow depths. Analysis by DAN experts revealed that a better understanding of cardiovascular disease and the buddy system’s role in dive fatalities is crucial.
    

      
      Dive fatalities are complex and poorly understood. If similar medical conditions and circumstances were to appear in a person outside of the water, death might be attributed to a chronic disease. Because symptoms presented in the water, however, the fatality is often attributed to diving. It is this complexity that makes it so challenging for scientists to decipher the risk factors and spurious associations in fatal and nonfatal dive accidents.
    

      
      It is not surprising that nonfatal scuba injuries occur with greater frequency than fatalities. The challenge in analyzing the trends and distribution of scuba injuries is identifying who is diving and how frequently.
    

      
      The analysis of the data on fatal and nonfatal breath-hold diving injuries yielded several insights. Notably, men were more often involved in breath-hold incidents than women, and people in their twenties and thirties were more often involved than people in other age groups. Divers over forty years of age, however, were more often involved in breath-hold fatalities. Breath-hold diving activities range from what could be described as child’s play to competitive freediving involving highly trained divers that push the limits of the human body. No matter the dive depth, it is vital that breath-hold divers understand the body’s reaction to diving. While chronic disease may have played a role in some of the analyzed cases, there is also reason to believe that some deaths were due to miscalculations of the individuals’ ability to hold their breath long enough to return to the surface.
    

      
      To prevent injury and loss of life, change must happen at various levels. We continue to expand our outreach to divers and dive professionals through training and risk management programs. DAN’s first aid and HIRA programs are the most relevant, detailed, and comprehensive such programs in the industry.
    

      
      This report has pages of detailed case analysis. Some of you will read through each in detail, while others will give them a passing glance. Perhaps the most important message to take away is that divers must continue to help divers stay safe.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32991099/,2022-11-28 03:01:37 AM
"Epilepsy, scuba diving and risk assessment. Near misses and the need for ongoing vigilance","David Smart, John Lippmann, David Smart, John Lippmann",2013 Mar,"There is ongoing debate about the safety of scuba diving for individuals with a history of epilepsy. An in-water seizure is highly likely to be fatal. Recommendations for fitness to dive vary with some regarding epilepsy as an absolute contraindication to diving (South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society) and others permitting diving under strict criteria (United Kingdom Sport Diving Medical Committee) with diving to be postponed for a period of three to five years without seizures. Long-term follow up of people with epilepsy shows that at least one-third will have a recurrence and that the risk remains elevated for many years. We present three cases where individuals with a history of epilepsy (or likely epilepsy) almost fell through the cracks of health risk assessment, two with near-fatal consequences. These cases inform the on-going debate about fitness to dive for those with current or past epilepsy, and highlight the importance of education for doctors, dive professionals and divers about the risks associated with epilepsy and diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23508661/,2022-11-28 03:01:38 AM

      The increase in recreational scuba diving in recent years, including children, involves risks and the possibility of accidents. While legislation, conditions and risks of scuba diving are well documented in adults, scientific evidence in scuba diving by children and adolescents is sparse and isolated. Furthermore, existing guidelines and recommendations for adults cannot be transferred directly to children.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      These circumstances have led to the Group on Techniques of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Pulmonology (SENP) to perform a literature search to review and update the knowledge about scuba diving in children.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Physiological adaptations of the body are examined during the dive, as well as the anatomical and physiological characteristics of children that should be taken into account in scuba diving. The most common types of accidents and its causes, as well as the risks of scuba diving practice in children with previous diseases are discussed, along with details of the medical and psychological requirements for scuba diving to be considered in the assessment of child and adolescent.

Risk stratification of neurological decompression sickness in divers,"M Sramek, J Honek, A Tomek, T Ruzickova, T Honek, L Sefc, M Sramek, J Honek, A Tomek, T Ruzickova, T Honek, L Sefc",2022,"Introduction:
        
      
      Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a risk factor of decompression sickness (DCS). However, data on risk stratification of divers with a PFO are sparse. This study sought to evaluate the risk of neurological DCS (DCSneuro), based on the presence and grade of a right-to-left shunt (RLS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 640 divers were screened for a RLS using TCD between 1/2006 and 4/2017. RLS was graded as low, medium, or high grade with two subgroups - after a Valsalva maneuver or at rest. Divers were questioned about their DCS history. Survival analysis techniques were used to assess risk factors for unprovoked DCS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A RLS was found in 258 divers (40.3 %). 44 (17.1 %) divers with a RLS experienced DCSneuro compared to 5 (1.3 %) divers without a RLS (p <0.001). The proportion of DCSneuro increased from 4.6 % in the low-grade RLS subgroup to 57.1 % in the subgroup with high-grade RLS at rest. The hazard ratio for DCSneuro and RLS was11.806 (p <0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Divers with a RLS had a higher risk of DCSneuro and the risk increased with RLS grade. We suggest that TCD is an appropriate method for RLS screening and risk stratification in divers (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 29).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35065581/,2022-11-28 03:01:39 AM
SCUBA Diving in Pregnancy,"Robert L Reid, Melissa Lorenzo, Robert L Reid, Melissa Lorenzo",2018 Nov,"Objective:
        
      
      Obstetrical care providers may occasionally encounter women with questions about the safety of Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) diving in pregnancy. This article provides an overview of safety issues associated with basic SCUBA diving and offers guidance to practitioners about how to evaluate and counsel pregnant women about the associated maternal and fetal risks. Basic diving physiology is reviewed and the implications of SCUBA diving during pregnancy are discussed. A literature review examined available animal and human data about the potential adverse effects of the physiological changes of pregnancy on divers, the impact of pressure changes during diving, and possible consequences of hyperbaric gas exposure and rapid decompression on mother and fetus.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Studies were found by searching the terms ""scuba diving,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""fetus,"" ""decompression illness,"" ""hyperbaric medicine,"" and ""animal studies"" in the databases Medline, Pubmed, and Embase. Reference lists from existing articles and reports from identified diving magazines were also reviewed. Studies were limited to the English language and included publications until 2016.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      All relevant human studies were selected. Five retrospective studies and one prospective study assessing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of women who participated in SCUBA diving while pregnant were reviewed.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Published data was limited in both quantity and quality. The authors' experience with SCUBA diving together with a background in obstetrics allowed themes to be explored and recommendations developed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In addition to established risks of SCUBA diving, pregnant women are at increased risk due to changes in body habitus (affecting equipment fitting and balance). Animal data suggest possible adverse fetal effects due to fetal decompression illness (DCI) and hyperbaric oxygen exposure. Human data, though generally reassuring, are of poor quality and thus do not completely exclude adverse outcomes. In general, women should be cautioned to avoid diving during pregnancy, but inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29503252/,2022-11-28 03:01:40 AM
[Diving and asthma: Literature review],"A Muller, M Rochoy, A Muller, M Rochoy",2018 Dec,"Introduction:
        
      
      Scuba diving has long been contraindicated for asthmatics. Recommendations are evolving towards authorisation under certain conditions. Our objective was to review the literature on the risks associated with scuba diving among asthmatics and about recommendations on this subject.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We used the MEDLINE and LiSSa databases, until June 2018, in French, English or Spanish language, with the keywords ""asthma AND diving"" and ""asthme plongée"" respectively. References to the first degree were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We have included 65 articles. Risk of bronchospasm is well documented, particularly in cold and/or deep water, or in the event of exposure to allergens (compressor without filter). Nonasthmatic atopic divers may be at greater risk of developing bronchial hyper-reactivity. Although the theoretical risk exists, epidemiological studies do not seem to show an over-risk of barotrauma, decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism in asthmatics. French, British, American, Spanish and Australian societies agreed on the exclusion of patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma, FEV1<80%, active asthma in the last 48hours, exercise/cold asthma and poor physical fitness.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A diver's examination should include a triple assessment: asthma control, number of exacerbations and treatment compliance. Homogenizing the recommendations would improve the framework for the practice of diving among asthmatics and allow larger studies in this population. Communicating the current recommendations remains important to divers, dive instructors and doctors in the context of the development of scuba diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30442511/,2022-11-28 03:01:41 AM
Fatalities in recreational boating and sub-aqua diving,"Stephen E Roberts, Detlef Nielsen, Bogdan Jaremin, Stephen E Roberts, Detlef Nielsen, Bogdan Jaremin",2013,"Background and aim:
        
      
      To establish the causes and circumstances of fatalities in recreational boating and sub-aqua diving inland or around the United Kingdom during the years 2006 and 2007, to comparefatal accident rates according to the type of boat, to identify causal patterns, and to discuss preventative measures to reduce the fatalities.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Examinations of marine accident files and reports from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch and other sources, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Association of Inland Navigation Authorities and the British Sub-Aqua Diving Club.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 102 fatalities in recreational boating and 28 in sub-aqua diving with corresponding fatal accident rates of 12.0 and 48.0 per million participants. In recreational boating, fatal accident rates were highest for motor and power boats (20.2), yachts (19.3) and canal boats (16.0). Most fatalities (64%) occurred from April to September, with a peak during August. In recreational boating, 24% of fatalities were recorded as alcohol-related. These were most prevalent in canal boats, occurring largely during the autumn and winter months rather than during summer holidays, among people living on boats, often asa result of fires and falls overboard.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Causal patterns of the fatalities varied strongly according to the type of recreational boat anddiving. Prevention of fatalities should include raising awareness of hazards, adequate training in diving, yachting and canoeing, etc., installation and maintenance of smoke alarms and fire extinguishers on residential boats, and increases in the use of personal flotation devices in recreational boating.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24408142/,2022-11-28 03:01:41 AM
[Remotely operated underwater vehicles used in water rescue],"Thorsten Lück, Volker Kvasnicka, Anabell Lück, Thorsten Lück, Volker Kvasnicka, Anabell Lück",2021 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      The search for and rescue of missing persons is always coupled with a high demand on human resources. In cases of suspected drowning it is often necessary to search huge expanses of water. For depths of more than 3-5 m the search and rescue procedure needs to be performed by specialist rescue divers. Due to saturation with nitrogen caused by the higher ambient pressure during the dive, the operating time for each rescue diver is limited. In addition, each dive is linked with an increased risk.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Miniaturization of sensors, higher performance of embedded systems and high energy density of modern accumulators offer the chance to operate with unmanned flying and diving vehicles for search and rescue even with moderate financial investment.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Based on funding by the Federation of the German Live Saving Association (DLRG) the DLRG national association of Bavaria procured three different models of remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROUV) and two different systems for underwater positioning. These systems will be offered to local associations of the DLRG in Bavaria for intense testing in their waters based on a common implementation strategy to ensure comparability and reproducibility.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Initial tests with different types of ROUV and underwater positioning have been performed in preparation of the survey. As a result, mini-ROUVs found in the lower consumer segment have been identified as insufficient as they are not able to carry the additional payload of the underwater positioning systems whilst maintaining controllability. In contrast, more complex drones are difficult to handle and require longer preparation times before they are ready for use. The ROUVs in the median range, preferably with a streamlined structure, have so far been found to be optimal; however, operating the vehicle without a positioning system is not recommended.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In combination with an underwater positioning system, remotely operated underwater vehicles are identified as a reasonable supplement for rescue divers. Fast time to operation enables a preview of the operating area before starting the rescue operation and can therefore support the rescue diver team.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34652471/,2022-11-28 03:01:42 AM
A case-control questionnaire survey of decompression sickness risk in Okinawa divers,"Naoko Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita, Mitsuhiro Enomoto, Yasushi Kojima, Takuya Oyaizu, Masaharu Shibayama, Kazuo Yamamoto, Naoko Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita, Mitsuhiro Enomoto, Yasushi Kojima, Takuya Oyaizu, Masaharu Shibayama, Kazuo Yamamoto",2018 Jan-Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Decompression sickness (DCS) is a rare condition that is often difficult to diagnose in deep-sea divers. Because of this, prevention and early diagnosis are important. In this case-control study, we examined the risk and preventive factors associated with DCS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Our original questionnaire survey was conducted among 269 recreational divers in Okinawa. Divers who were diagnosed with DCS by a physician (n = 94) were compared with healthy recreational divers (n = 175). The questionnaire consisted of 30 items and included a dive profile. Odds ratios and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to estimate the relative risk of DCS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Logistic regression analysis revealed the following risk factors for DCS: a past history of DCS, drinking alcohol the evening before diving, indicating decompression stops, cold exposure after the dive, and maximum depth. Preventive factors included hydration before the dive, deep stops, safety stops and using nitrox gas. The results were reliable according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow and omnibus tests.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We identified certain risk factors, together with their relative risks, for DCS. These risk factors may facilitate prevention of DCS among Okinawa divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29571231/,2022-11-28 03:01:43 AM
Barotrauma and Arterial Gas Embolism: A Diving Emergencies Simulation Case for Emergency Medicine Residents,"Leah Marion Bralow, Mark Piehl, Leah Marion Bralow, Mark Piehl",2018 Dec 21,"Introduction:
        
      
      Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a rare but severe complication of scuba diving. While AGE is most commonly encountered in coastal areas with high volumes of recreational divers, at-risk populations exist throughout the United States, making basic knowledge of the disease important for all emergency medicine (EM) physicians.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We used a hypothetical simulation case to train EM residents on diagnosis and management of AGE. A 32-year-old male presented with shortness of breath and unilateral neurologic deficits immediately after scuba diving. Residents were challenged to emergently diagnose and treat tension pneumothorax followed by diagnosis and treatment of AGE. A resident, attending, and simulation technician ran the case for four separate simulation teams in the simulation center with the addition of chest tube supplies to the basic resuscitation bay setup. Teams were allowed to use the internet in real time as a reference tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most teams arrived at the correct diagnosis using real-time internet searches, but none found the Divers Alert Network Emergency Hotline. Learners were debriefed both immediately and in a formal lecture. A follow-up survey showed good retention of knowledge.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This case fills a significant knowledge and training gap for many EM physicians. AGE is a rare but highly morbid complication of diving, and EM residents should have knowledge of the disease and available consultation resources. Most EM residents will not have the opportunity to treat a diver during training, and the simulation environment provides a means to teach and practice this skill set.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30800988/,2022-11-28 03:01:43 AM
Lower-extremity isokinetic strength ratios of elite springboard and platform diving athletes,"Amilton Vieira, Savio Alex, André Martorelli, Lee E Brown, Ricardo Moreira, Martim Bottaro, Amilton Vieira, Savio Alex, André Martorelli, Lee E Brown, Ricardo Moreira, Martim Bottaro",2017 May,"Objectives:
        
      
      The purpose of the present study was to examine knee extensor and flexor muscle strength ratios of an elite group of diving athletes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixteen divers (10 females and 6 males) from the Brazil national team were assessed for lower-body strength. They had participated in international competitions such as the 2016 Olympic Games and 2015 Pan American Games. The dynamic concentric torque of their knee flexor and extensor muscles were evaluated using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Bilateral tests were performed at 60º s-1. Flexor to extensor (F/E) peak torque ratio and percentage bilateral difference (BD%) was also measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results revealed that elite diving athletes produced higher than usual reported in previous studies for relative knee extension torque (3.2 for females and 3.6 for males N∙m∙kg-1). However, they presented low levels of knee flexor torque (1.5 for females and 1.8 for males N∙m∙kg-1). These results are reflected in a low F/E ratio (0.39 to 0.49). Males presented a greater BD% in knee flexors when compared to females (12.4% vs 6.6%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Elite diving athletes demonstrated high knee extensor and low knee flexor strength. This partially explains their low F/E ratio, which might increase risk of knee injuries. Strength and conditioning programs should strive to correct knee strength imbalances in diving athletes where necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28294692/,2022-11-28 03:01:44 AM
Longitudinal screening of hearing threshold in navy divers: is diving really a hazard?,"Thijs T Wingelaar, Edwin L Endert, Rigo Hoencamp, Peter-Jan Am van Ooij, Rob A van Hulst, Thijs T Wingelaar, Edwin L Endert, Rigo Hoencamp, Peter-Jan Am van Ooij, Rob A van Hulst",2019 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hearing loss (HL) is common in the adult working population. It is widely assumed that diving is a risk factor for HL. However, studies with sufficient follow-up comparing HL in divers to non-divers are limited. This study aimed to assess the hearing threshold (HT) of Royal Netherlands Navy divers who had been diving for more than 15 years and to compare it to the ISO standard 7029:2017 reference table.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this 25-year retrospective cohort study the Royal Netherlands Navy Diving Medical Centre audited the medical records of 1,117 Navy divers. Yearly dive medical assessments were performed according to professional standards, including audiometry. HTs were compared to the ISO 7029:2017 reference table, including Z-distribution, using paired t-tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-five divers were included who had been diving for 15 years or longer. The HT increased significantly in nine of the 16 measured frequencies, while the Z-score decreased significantly in nine of the 16 tested frequencies (eight in both ears). In the 25-year follow-up the pattern was more obvious, with one significantly increased HT, and 10 significantly decreased Z-scores.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The absolute HT increases after 15 years of military diving, but less than would be expected from normal age-related deterioration. Moreover, when comparing Z-scores, this sample of divers actually hear better than non-divers. We conclude that military diving is not an increased risk for HL compared to regular occupational hazards and suggest withdrawing the requirement for routine yearly audiometric evaluation as part of a dive medical examination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31828747/,2022-11-28 03:01:45 AM
Marine creatures dangerous for divers in tropical waters,"Jarosław Krzyżak, Krzysztof Korzeniewski, Jarosław Krzyżak, Krzysztof Korzeniewski",2021,"Diving has been gaining in popularity in recent years with spectacular dive sites in tropical waters. Before anyone goes diving, they should learn about the risk factors associated with the exposure to hyperbaric conditions and also the risks from exposure to marine life. Apart from amazing views of the coral reefs, divers may be astonished by the magnitude of marine species diversity in local waters, ranging from predators (sharks, barracuda, moray eels) to venomous or stinging fish (jellyfish, anemones) and sea snakes. If travelers are unprepared and know little about the existing risk factors, a diving trip that was much looked forward to may turn out to have some very unpleasant consequences.

Carbon dioxide absorbents for rebreather diving,"John Pennefather, John Pennefather",2016 Sep,"Firstly I would like to thank SPUMS members for making me a Life Member of SPUMS; I was surprised and greatly honoured by the award. I also want to confirm and expand on the findings on carbon dioxide absorbents reported by David Harvey et al. For about 35 years, I was the main player in deciding which absorbent went into Australian Navy and Army diving sets. On several occasions, suppliers of absorbents to the anaesthesia market tried to supply the Australian military market. On no occasion did they provide absorbent that came close to the minimum absorbent capacity required, generally being 30-40% less efficient than diving-grade absorbents. Because I regard lives as being more important than any likely dollar saving, the best absorbent was always selected unless two suppliers provided samples with the same absorbent capacity. On almost every occasion, there was a clear winner and cost was never considered. I suggest the same argument for the best absorbent should be used by members and their friends who dive using rebreather sets. I make this point because of my findings on a set that was brought to me after the death of its owner. The absorbent was not the type or grain size recommended by the manufacturer of the set and did not resemble any of the diving grade absorbents I knew of. I suspected by its appearance that it was anaesthetic grade absorbent. When I tested the set, the absorbent system failed very quickly so it is likely that carbon dioxide toxicity contributed to his death. The death was not the subject of an inquest and I have no knowledge of how the man obtained the absorbent. Possibly there was someone from an operating theatre staff who unintentionally caused their friend's death by supplying him with 'borrowed absorbent'. I make this point as I would like to discourage members from making a similar error.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723020/,2022-11-28 03:01:46 AM
Power Equation for Predicting the Risk of Central Nervous System Oxygen Toxicity at Rest,"Ben Aviner, Ran Arieli, Alexandra Yalov, Ben Aviner, Ran Arieli, Alexandra Yalov",2020 Aug 17,"Patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and divers engaged in underwater activity are at risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity. An algorithm for predicting CNS oxygen toxicity in active underwater diving has been published previously, but not for humans at rest. Using a procedure similar to that employed for the derivation of our active diving algorithm, we collected data for exposures at rest, in which subjects breathed hyperbaric oxygen while immersed in thermoneutral water at 33°C (n = 219) or in dry conditions (n = 507). The maximal likelihood method was employed to solve for the parameters of the power equation. For immersion, the CNS oxygen toxicity index is K I = t2 × PO2 10.93, where the calculated risk from the Standard Normal distribution is Z I = [ln(K I 0.5) - 8.99)]/0.81. For dry exposures this is K D = t2 × PO2 12.99, with risk Z D = [ln(K D 0.5) - 11.34)]/0.65. We propose a method for interpolating the parameters at metabolic rates between 1 and 4.4 MET. The risk of CNS oxygen toxicity at rest was found to be greater during immersion than in dry conditions. We discuss the prediction properties of the new algorithm in the clinical hyperbaric environment, and suggest it may be adopted for use in planning procedures for hyperbaric oxygen therapy and for rest periods during saturation diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33013440/,2022-11-28 03:01:47 AM
"A review of snorkelling and scuba diving fatalities in Queensland, Australia, 2000 to 2019","John Lippmann, John Lippmann",2022 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study examined all known diving-related fatalities in Queensland, Australia, from 2000 to 2019 to determine likely causes and potential countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were extracted from the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation fatality database, including previously published reports. The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify diving-related deaths in Queensland for 2014-2019 and data were extracted, analysed, and combined with previously published data covering the period 2000-2013. Descriptive statistics and parametric and non-parametric tests were used to analyse these data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 166 snorkelling and 41 scuba victims identified with median ages of 59 and 49 years respectively, and 83% of snorkel and 64% of scuba victims were males. One quarter of snorkel and 40% of scuba victims were obese. Two-thirds of the snorkellers and three quarters of scuba divers were overseas tourists. Contributory predisposing health conditions were identified in 61% of snorkel and 50% of scuba victims. Nine scuba victims died on their first dive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The increase in snorkelling deaths likely reflects increased participation, higher age, and poorer health. The main disabling condition in both cohorts was cardiac-related. Pre-existing health conditions, poor skills, inexperience, poor planning, supervision shortcomings and lack of effective buddy systems featured in both cohorts, and apnoeic hypoxia in breath-hold divers. Suggested countermeasures include improved education on the importance of health and fitness for safe diving and snorkelling, increased emphasis on an honest and accurate pre-activity health declaration and subsequent implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies, improved supervision, better buddy pairing, and on-going education on the hazards of extended apnoea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732283/,2022-11-28 03:01:47 AM
Changes in the gut microbiota during and after commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving in China,"Yuan Yuan, Guosheng Zhao, Hongwei Ji, Bin Peng, Zhiguo Huang, Wei Jin, Xiaoqiang Chen, Haitao Guan, Guangsheng Tang, Hui Zhang, Zhenglin Jiang, Yuan Yuan, Guosheng Zhao, Hongwei Ji, Bin Peng, Zhiguo Huang, Wei Jin, Xiaoqiang Chen, Haitao Guan, Guangsheng Tang, Hui Zhang, Zhenglin Jiang",2019 Nov,"Objectives:
        
      
      The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving. Their living and excursion depths were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO2 of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the bacteria composition in the divers' guts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen saturation decreased the abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium, an obligate anaerobe, from 2.43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3. Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as Fusicatenibacter, Faecalibacterium, rectale group and Anaerostipes, showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after diving. On the contrary, the abundance of species, such as Lactococcus garvieae, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Peptoclostridium difficile, Butyricimonas virosa, Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and A. graevenitzii, showed an increasing trend, but most of them were pathogens.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Occupational exposure to high pressure in a helium-oxygen saturation environment decreased the abundance of Bifidobacterium and some SCFA-producing bacteria, and increased the risk of pathogenic bacterial infection. Supplementation of the diver diet with probiotics or prebiotics during saturation diving might prevent these undesirable changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31554647/,2022-11-28 03:01:48 AM
The relationship of decongestant use and risk of decompression sickness; a case-control study of Hawaiian scuba divers,"Richard W Smerz, Richard W Smerz",2014 Feb,"Exposure to cold, dehydration, and aging are known to contribute to the development of decompression sickness (DCS) in divers. Hypertension and nicotine usage have also been suggested as risk factors. Vasoconstriction is an underlying mechanism associated with all of these risk factors. Vasoconstriction increases the degree of bubble formation which is believed to be the cause of DCS. Formed bubbles interfere with the production of nitric oxide which modulates vascular tone resulting in vasoconstriction. Divers commonly use sympathomimetic decongestants which induce vasoconstriction to prevent barotrauma of the ears and sinuses while diving and thus theoretically may contribute to the risk for developing DCS. The purpose of this case-control study was to explore the association between decongestant usage and development of DCS in 400 divers treated/evaluated at the University of Hawai'i, John A. Burns School of Medicine between 1983 and 2010. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were employed to evaluate differences between cases and controls. In addition to the variable of interest, other co-variables known to have significant influence in the development of DCS were appropriately controlled for during the analyses. In this study population, dehydration (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.4), repetitive diving (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.8, 4.4), and violation of dive profiles (OR = 4.9; 95% CI: 3.1, 7.9) contributed independently and significantly to the development of DCS. The co-variables of cold, gender, obesity, and rapid ascents were not significant contributors to developing DCS in this study. There was a small but statistically insignificant risk associated with decongestant use (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.8-2.6; P = .22). The inherent limitations associated with records-based studies may have underestimated this risk. It is important therefore that future research be undertaken to help clarify this concern.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24567870/,2022-11-28 03:01:49 AM
The risks of scuba diving: a focus on Decompression Illness,"Jennifer Hall, Jennifer Hall",2014 Nov,"Decompression Illness includes both Decompression Sickness (DCS) and Pulmonary Overinflation Syndrome (POIS), subsets of diving-related injury related to scuba diving. DCS is a condition in which gas bubbles that form while diving do not have adequate time to be resorbed or ""off-gassed,"" resulting in entrapment in specific regions of the body. POIS is due to an overly rapid ascent to the surface resulting in the rupture of alveoli and subsequent extravasation of air bubbles into tissue planes or even the cerebral circulation. Divers must always be cognizant of dive time and depth, and be trained in the management of decompression. A slow and controlled ascent, plus proper control of buoyancy can reduce the dangerous consequences of pulmonary barotrauma. The incidence of adverse effects can be diminished with safe practices, allowing for the full enjoyment of this adventurous aquatic sport.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25478296/,2022-11-28 03:01:50 AM

Risk of spontaneous pneumothorax due to air travel and diving in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome,"P C Johannesma, I van de Beek, J W T van der Wel, M A Paul, A C Houweling, M A Jonker, J H T M van Waesberghe, R Reinhard, Th M Starink, R J A van Moorselaar, F H Menko, P E Postmus, P C Johannesma, I van de Beek, J W T van der Wel, M A Paul, A C Houweling, M A Jonker, J H T M van Waesberghe, R Reinhard, Th M Starink, R J A van Moorselaar, F H Menko, P E Postmus",2016 Sep 7,"Background and objectives:
        
      
      Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skin fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax and renal cell cancer due to germline folliculin (FLCN) mutations (Menko et al. in Lancet Oncol 10(12):1199-1206, 2009). The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with BHD during or shortly after air travel and diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A questionnaire was sent to a cohort of 190 BHD patients and the medical files of these patients were evaluated. The diagnosis of BHD was confirmed by FLCN mutations analysis in all patients. We assessed how many spontaneous pneumothoraces (SP) occurred within 1 month after air travel or diving.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total 158 (83.2 %) patients returned the completed questionnaire. A total of 145 patients had a history of air travel. Sixty-one of them had a history of SP (42.1 %), with a mean of 2.48 episodes (range 1-10). Twenty-four (35.8 %) patients had a history of pneumothorax on both sides. Thirteen patients developed SP < 1 month after air travel (9.0 %) and two patients developed a SP < 1 month after diving (3.7 %). We found in this population of BHD patients a pneumothorax risk of 0.63 % per flight and a risk of 0.33 % per episode of diving. Symptoms possible related to SP were perceived in 30 patients (20.7 %) after air travel, respectively in ten patients (18.5 %) after diving.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Based on the results presented in this retrospective study, exposure of BHD patients to considerable changes in atmospheric pressure associated with flying and diving may be related to an increased risk for developing a symptomatic pneumothorax. Symptoms reported during or shortly after flying and diving might be related to the early phase of pneumothorax. An individualized advice should be given, taking also into account patients' preferences and needs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27652079/,2022-11-28 03:01:51 AM
Extensive Simulated Diving Aggravates Endothelial Dysfunction in Male Pro-atherosclerotic ApoE Knockout Rats,"Simin Berenji Ardestani, Vladimir V Matchkov, Kasper Hansen, Nichlas Riise Jespersen, Michael Pedersen, Ingrid Eftedal, Simin Berenji Ardestani, Vladimir V Matchkov, Kasper Hansen, Nichlas Riise Jespersen, Michael Pedersen, Ingrid Eftedal",2020 Dec 23,"Introduction:
        
      
      The average age of the diving population is rising, and the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in divers are accordingly increasing. It is an open question whether this risk is altered by diving per se. In this study, we examined the effect of 7-weeks simulated diving on endothelial function and mitochondrial respiration in atherosclerosis-prone rats.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-four male ApoE knockout (KO) rats (9-weeks-old) were fed a Western diet for 8 weeks before 12 rats were exposed to simulated heliox dry-diving in a pressure chamber (600 kPa for 60 min, decompression of 50 kPa/min). The rats were dived twice-weekly for 7 weeks, resulting in a total of 14 dives. The remaining 12 non-diving rats served as controls. Endothelial function of the pulmonary and mesenteric arteries was examined in vitro using an isometric myograph. Mitochondrial respiration in cardiac muscle tissues was measured using high-resolution respirometry.
    


          Results and conclusion:
        
      
      Both ApoE KO diving and non-diving rats showed changes in endothelial function at the end of the intervention, but the extent of these changes was larger in the diving group. Altered nitric oxide signaling was primarily involved in these changes. Mitochondrial respiration was unaltered. In this pro-atherosclerotic rat model of cardiovascular changes, extensive diving appeared to aggravate endothelial dysfunction rather than promote adaptation to oxidative stress.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33424633/,2022-11-28 03:01:52 AM

      Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) diving has become increasingly popular with millions of people diving each year. Otorhinolaryngologists are often consulted either by patients or diving physicians regarding fitness to dive, and at present, the guidelines do not provide comprehensive information regarding the evaluation of this patient cohort. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of existing otorhinolaryngological guidelines for fitness to dive recreationally.
    


          Observations:
        
      
      There is a paucity of guidelines for assessing otorhinolaryngological fitness to dive in the recreational diver. Comprehensive guidelines exist from US, European, and UK regulatory bodies regarding fitness for commercial diving; however, not all of these can be directly extrapolated to the recreational diver. There are also a variety of conditions that are not covered either by the existing fitness for recreational diving guidelines or the commercial regulatory bodies.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      With the paucity of recreational fitness to dive guidelines we must draw on information from the commercial diving regulatory bodies. We have provided our own recommendations on the conditions that are not covered by either of the above, to provide otorhinolaryngologists with the information they require to assess fitness for recreational diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29450499/,2022-11-28 03:01:52 AM
Slamming dynamics of diving and its implications for diving-related injuries,"Anupam Pandey, Jisoo Yuk, Brian Chang, Frank E Fish, Sunghwan Jung, Anupam Pandey, Jisoo Yuk, Brian Chang, Frank E Fish, Sunghwan Jung",2022 Jul 29,"In nature, many animals dive into water at high speeds, e.g., humans dive from cliffs, birds plunge, and aquatic animals porpoise and breach. Diving provides opportunities for animals to find prey and escape from predators and is a source of great excitement for humans. However, diving from high platforms can cause severe injuries to a diver. In this study, we demonstrate how similarity in the morphology of diving fronts unifies the slamming force across diving animals and humans. By measuring a time-averaged impulse that increases linearly with the impact height, we are able to estimate the unsteady hydrodynamic forces that an average human body experiences during the slamming phase of a feet-first, hand-first, or head-first dive. We evaluate whether the unsteady forces put the diver at risk of muscle or bone injuries for a particular diving height. Therefore, this study sheds light on a hydrodynamics-based protocol for safe high diving and an evolutionary driver for animal morphology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35895822/,2022-11-28 03:01:53 AM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2018 Edition: A Report on 2016 Diving Fatalities, Injuries, and Incidents [Internet]","Peter Buzzacott, Petar J. Denoble, Peter Buzzacott, Petar J. Denoble",,"The 2018 DAN Annual Diving Report is a summary of recreational scuba diving and freediving incidents, injuries and fatalities that occurred in 2016 in the U.S. or Canada or that involved U.S. or Canadian residents. DAN’s intention is for this annual publication to enhance awareness of dive injuries and give divers the insights they need to better avoid emergencies.
    

      
      DAN received notification of 169 deaths involving recreational scuba diving in 2016. The largest numbers of reported fatalities occurred in Florida and California, with 20 and 7 fatalities respectively.
    

      
      The geospatial distribution of the reported fatalities by region is: 72 in North America, 27 in Europe, 23 in Oceania, 19 in the Caribbean, 18 in Asia, 4 in South America, and 1 each in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East and Central America. The location was unknown in two cases.
    

      
      Diving injury data analyzed in this report comes mainly from DAN’s Medical Services Call Center (MSCC) and its annual survey of hyperbaric chambers. Section 2, Diving Injuries, categorizes the types of injuries managed by DAN Medical Services and includes summaries of actual cases. In 2016, there were 10,320 calls or emails to the MSCC from divers who needed assistance, information or consultation; 59% of these cases were dive-related, and 41% were not. The most common dive-related health issues discussed during these calls were barotrauma, decompression sickness and marine envenomations.
    

      
      The Diving Incident Reporting System (DIRS) collects diving incident reports through the DAN website, www.DAN.org. Divers worldwide are encouraged to report any incidents that occur during dives via this system. Of the 102 incidents reported in 2016, 91 involved open-circuit scuba diving, 5 involved rebreather diving, and 6 involved breath-hold diving.
    

      
      In addition to the injury surveillance data collected by DAN in Durham, North Carolina, additional injury surveillance data analyzed in this report was contributed by DAN-affiliated agencies and other organizations around the world. Section 5 features reports from DAN Europe, DAN Japan and DAN Asia Pacific. Other organizations that reported their findings were the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), New Zealand Underwater Association, the Irish Underwater Council and the Underwater Council of British Columbia.
    

      
      Although scuba diving accidents can be fatal, many can be prevented with safe diving practices and by understanding how to identify hazards and avoid or mitigate the risks that cause accidents. The DAN Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Program enables divers and dive operators to recognize and avoid these risks; this program is described in Appendix B: DAN Operational Safety Programs.
    

      
      DAN exists to provide divers with the resources they need to make every dive accident- and injury-free. When accidents cannot be prevented, DAN is here to provide divers with emergency assistance no matter where in the world they are.
    

      
      With the support of all the DAN offices and contributors worldwide, DAN is committed to providing resources that will resonate with and be useful to divers everywhere.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021587/,2022-11-28 03:01:54 AM
Cardiovascular considerations for scuba divers,"Jason V Tso, Joshua M Powers, Jonathan H Kim, Jason V Tso, Joshua M Powers, Jonathan H Kim",2022 Jun 24,"As the popularity of scuba diving increases internationally, physicians interacting with divers in the clinical setting must be familiar with the cardiovascular stresses and risks inherent to this activity. Scuba presents a formidable cardiovascular challenge by combining unique environmental conditions with the physiologic demands of underwater exercise. Haemodynamic stresses encountered at depth include increased hydrostatic pressure leading to central shifts in plasma volume coupled with cold water stimuli leading to simultaneous parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic responses. Among older divers and those with underlying cardiovascular risk factors, these physiologic changes increase acute cardiac risks while diving. Additional scuba risks, as a consequence of physical gas laws, include arterial gas emboli and decompression sickness. These pathologies are particularly dangerous with altered sensorium in hostile dive conditions. When present, the appropriate management of patent foramen ovale (PFO) is uncertain, but closure of PFO may reduce the risk of paradoxical gas embolism in divers with a prior history of decompression sickness. Finally, similar to other Masters-level athletes, divers with underlying traditional cardiovascular risk should undergo complete cardiac risk stratification to determine 'fitness-to-dive'. The presence of undertreated coronary artery disease, occult cardiomyopathy, channelopathy and arrhythmias must all be investigated and appropriately treated in order to ensure diver safety. A patient-centred approach facilitating shared decision-making between divers and experienced practitioners should be utilised in the management of prospective scuba divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34670825/,2022-11-28 03:01:54 AM
Children's Understanding of No Diving Warning Signs: Implications for Preventing Childhood Injury,"Barbara A Morrongiello, Amanda Cox, Rachel Scott, Sarah E Sutey, Barbara A Morrongiello, Amanda Cox, Rachel Scott, Sarah E Sutey",2016 Jul 7,"The current study examined children's understanding of No Diving warning signs. Normally-developing 7 to 10 year olds were asked questions to assess their understanding of text, images, and main messages on No Diving warning signs. These structured interviews were audio recorded and responses were later coded. Results revealed that children understood the behavior advised against (diving), why it is prohibited (can hit head on the bottom), and what can happen (serious injury including hospitalization). They understood that breaking your neck results in limitations in mobility and can occur from diving, but they did not anticipate that such an injury is likely to occur. There were no gender and few age differences, but diving experience was associated with children significantly downplaying their risk of injury. The findings suggest that having No Diving warning signs explicitly mention a broken neck, may serve to remind children of this potential consequence at the time of decision making.

Cervicocranial artery dissection and scuba diving: Is there a link or is it serendipity?,"Gerald K Walters, Gerald K Walters",2018 Jan-Feb,"Introduction:
        
      
      Numerous reports have documented cervicocranial artery dissection (CCAD) associated with scuba diving. The question remains as to whether there are risk factors unique to scuba diving related to the occurrence of CCAD.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This article aims to perform an examination of the reported cases to demonstrate any commonality among the injured divers and association with known risk factors for CCAD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A PubMed search was performed utilizing the key words: carotid artery dissection, dissection, arterial dissection, cranial artery dissection, scuba, diving, scuba diving. Articles including reports, reviews, trials, case series, and letters were considered. Each report was critically dissected for information specific to the dive itself and the diver and analyzed for similarities and consistency with known risks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve (12) reports of CCAD associated with scuba diving were identified. Activities involved with scuba diving appear to be consistent with CCAD risk factors. It is unclear if hyperbaric stress and physiological changes during a dive present specific risk. Trauma - e.g., environmental protection and activities associated with diving - was identified as a common risk factor in all cases. Ten (10) cases involved arteries at anatomic sites commonly associated with dissections. Seven divers documented to have dive profiles suspicious of decompression sickness were identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There appears to be a correlation with minor traumas that occur with diving and CCAD. The inconsistency of the dive-related specific information reported makes it impossible for investigation of hyperbaric stress-related risk factors for CCAD to be analyzed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29571234/,2022-11-28 03:01:55 AM
Influence of the diving wetsuit on standard spirometry,"Nico Am Schellart, Wouter Sterk, Nico Am Schellart, Wouter Sterk",2016 Sep,"INTRODUCTION A well-fitting wetsuit exerts a pressure on the body that may influence spirometry. This pressure is expected to reduce the forced vital capacity (FVC) due to hampered inspiration. Since the shape of the spirometric flow curve should not be changed by the pressure effects of the wetsuits, FVC, the forced expiratory volume during the first second of expiration (FEV₁), the peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75) should change to the same degree. This study investigates the influence of a wetsuit on spirometric variables using age, suit thickness and suit type as the parameters.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Spirometry (dry) was performed in 28 volunteers (12 women), aged 27-69 years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The wetsuit (3.8 mm, range 2-7 mm) resulted in a change in FVC of -4.0% (P = 2∙E-08 〈 0.001), in FEV₁ of -3.6% (P = 3∙E-05 〈 0.001) and in PEF of -2.4% (P = 0.03); the FEF25-75 may also diminish. The FEV₁/FVC ratio did not change. The decreases can be regarded as a quasi-ageing effect of about 3.5 years. No influence of age, suit thickness and suit type was found.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The wetsuit appears to impair ventilatory mechanics. Both the medical examiner and the diver should be aware that a too-thick or too-tight suit might be a potential pulmonary risk factor in diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723013/,2022-11-28 03:01:56 AM
Variability in circulating gas emboli after a same scuba diving exposure,"V Papadopoulou, P Germonpré, D Cosgrove, R J Eckersley, P A Dayton, G Obeid, A Boutros, M-X Tang, S Theunissen, C Balestra, V Papadopoulou, P Germonpré, D Cosgrove, R J Eckersley, P A Dayton, G Obeid, A Boutros, M-X Tang, S Theunissen, C Balestra",2018 Jun,"Purpose:
        
      
      A reduction in ambient pressure or decompression from scuba diving can result in ultrasound-detectable venous gas emboli (VGE). These environmental exposures carry a risk of decompression sickness (DCS) which is mitigated by adherence to decompression schedules; however, bubbles are routinely observed for dives well within these limits and significant inter-personal variability in DCS risk exists. Here, we assess the variability and evolution of VGE for 2 h post-dive using echocardiography, following a standardized pool dive in calm warm conditions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      14 divers performed either one or two (with a 24 h interval) standardized scuba dives to 33 mfw (400 kPa) for 20 min of immersion time at NEMO 33 in Brussels, Belgium. Measurements were performed at 21, 56, 91 and 126 min post-dive: bubbles were counted for all 68 echocardiography recordings and the average over ten consecutive cardiac cycles taken as the bubble score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significant inter-personal variability was demonstrated despite all divers following the same protocol in controlled pool conditions: in the detection or not of VGE, in the peak VGE score, as well as time to VGE peak. In addition, intra-personal differences in 2/3 of the consecutive day dives were seen (lower VGE counts or faster clearance).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Since VGE evolution post-dive varies between people, more work is clearly needed to isolate contributing factors. In this respect, going toward a more continuous evaluation, or developing new means to detect decompression stress markers, may offer the ability to better assess dynamic correlations to other physiological parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29616324/,2022-11-28 03:01:57 AM
Exercise intensity inferred from air consumption during recreational scuba diving,"Peter Buzzacott, Neal W Pollock, Michael Rosenberg, Peter Buzzacott, Neal W Pollock, Michael Rosenberg",2014 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Episodic exercise is a risk factor for acute cardiac events and cardiac complications are increasingly recognized in fatalities during recreational scuba diving. What is not known is the exercise intensity involved in typical recreational diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study used pre- to post-dive gas cylinder pressure drop to estimate air consumption and, from that, exercise intensity during recreational dives. Dive profiles were captured electronically and divers self-reported cylinder pressure changes, perceived workload, thermal status and any problems during dives. Mean surface air consumption (SAC) rate per kg body weight and mean exercise intensity (reported in metabolic equivalents, MET multiples of assumed resting metabolic rate of 3.5 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) were then estimated. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 959 recreational air dives (20 ± 9 metres' sea water maximum depth; 50 ± 12 min underwater time) by 139 divers (42 ± 10 y age; 11 ± 10 y of diving; 12% smokers; 73% male) were monitored. Problems were reported with 129/959 dives: buoyancy (45%), equalization (38%), rapid ascent (10%), vertigo (5%) and other (2%). Assuming a 10% overestimate due to cylinder cooling and uncontrolled gas loss, the estimated exercise intensity associated with monitored dives was 5 ± 1 MET. Mean ± 2SD, or 7 MET, captures the effort associated with the vast majority of dives monitored.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our estimates suggest that uncomplicated recreational dives require moderate-intensity energy expenditure to complete, with a 7-MET capacity generally adequate. Higher levels of aerobic fitness are still strongly recommended to ensure ample reserves. Further research is needed to quantify energetic demands of recreational diving during both typical and emergent events in both experienced and less experienced divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24986724/,2022-11-28 03:01:57 AM
Long term effects of recreational SCUBA diving on higher cognitive function,"W Hemelryck, P Germonpré, V Papadopoulou, M Rozloznik, C Balestra, W Hemelryck, P Germonpré, V Papadopoulou, M Rozloznik, C Balestra",2014 Dec,"We investigated long-term effects of SCUBA diving on cognitive function using a battery of neuropsychometric tests: the Simple Reaction Time (REA), Symbol Digit Substitution (SDS), Digit Span Backwards (DSB), and Hand-Eye Coordination tests (EYE). A group (n = 44) of experienced SCUBA divers with no history of decompression sickness was compared to non-diving control subjects (n = 37), as well as to professional boxers (n = 24), who are considered at higher risk of long term neurological damage. The REA was significantly shorter in SCUBA divers compared to the control subjects, and also more stable over the time course of the test. In contrast, the number of digits correctly memorized and reordered (DSB) was significantly lower for SCUBA divers compared to the control group. The results also showed that boxers performed significantly worse than the control group in three out of four tests (REA, DSB, EYE). While it may be concluded that accident-free SCUBA diving may have some long-term adverse effects on short-term memory, there is however, no evidence of general higher cognitive function deficiency.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23902533/,2022-11-28 03:01:58 AM
Pulmonary fluid shifts occur as a result of scuba diving at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab,"Kristi Ray, Sandra Williams, Stephen Morrical, Alejandro Garbino, Michelle Hong, Robert Sanders, Kristi Ray, Sandra Williams, Stephen Morrical, Alejandro Garbino, Michelle Hong, Robert Sanders",2020 Fourth Quarter,"Introduction:
        
      
      Pulmonary fluid shifts can occur while scuba diving. Such shifts, generally thought to be rare, may result in a life-threatening phenomenon known as immersion pulmonary edema (IPE). This study aims to better classify the normal physiology of diving using ultrasound (US) to determine if these fluid shifts occur routinely during commercial diving work at the NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Chest US was performed on commercial divers prospectively pre- and post-dive to evaluate the presence of B-lines in a total of 12 intercostal points on the anterior, posterior, and lateral chest wall. The number of B-lines at each anatomic site was recorded and scored by two independent reviewers. An increase in the number of B-lines post-dive was considered a positive result.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 67 exposures; 39 (58%) had an increase of one or more B-lines post dive; 64% of the female exposures and 57% of the male exposures were positive for B-lines post-dive, suggesting no difference across gender (Fisher's exact; p = 0.763). After the dive, all divers remained asymptomatic.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      From our results, fluid shifts can be viewed as a normal, transient, and physiologic process in commercial divers. This correlation can be compared to the formation of low-grade venous gas emboli (VGE) from decompression that does not result in decompression sickness. Further study of US B-lines in symptomatic divers may define the utility of field US in the diagnosis and management of IPE, and help identify associated risk factors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33227828/,2022-11-28 03:01:59 AM
Diving Responses in Experienced Rebreather Divers: Short-Term Heart Rate Variability in Cold Water Diving,"Richard V Lundell, Laura Tuominen, Tommi Ojanen, Kai Parkkola, Anne Räisänen-Sokolowski, Richard V Lundell, Laura Tuominen, Tommi Ojanen, Kai Parkkola, Anne Räisänen-Sokolowski",2021 Apr 7,"Introduction:
        
      
      Technical diving is very popular in Finland throughout the year despite diving conditions being challenging, especially due to arctic water and poor visibility. Cold water, immersion, submersion, hyperoxia, as well as psychological and physiological stress, all have an effect on the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      To evaluate divers' ANS responses, short-term (5 min) heart rate variability (HRV) during dives in 2-4°C water was measured. HRV resting values were evaluated from separate measurements before and after the dives. Twenty-six experienced closed circuit rebreather (CCR) divers performed an identical 45-meter decompression dive with a non-physical task requiring concentration at the bottom depth.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Activity of the ANS branches was evaluated with the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) indexes of the Kubios HRV Standard program. Compared to resting values, PNS activity decreased significantly on immersion with face out of water. From immersion, it increased significantly with facial immersion, just before decompression and just before surfacing. Compared to resting values, SNS activity increased significantly on immersion with face out of water. Face in water and submersion measures did not differ from the immersion measure. After these measurements, SNS activity decreased significantly over time.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study indicates that the trigeminocardiac part of the diving reflex causes the strong initial PNS activation at the beginning of the dive but the reaction seems to decrease quickly. After this initial activation, cold seemed to be the most prominent promoter of PNS activity - not pressure. Also, our study showed a concurrent increase in both SNS and PNS branches, which has been associated with an elevated risk for arrhythmia. Therefore, we recommend a short adaptation phase at the beginning of cold-water diving before physical activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33897457/,2022-11-28 03:02:00 AM
Prevalence and Risk Factors for Hearing Loss in Chilean Shellfish Divers,"Marie Astrid Garrido Campos, Benedikt Anselm Hindelang, Denise Siqueira De Carvalho, Ilse Urzúa Finke, Ronald Herrera, Katja Radon, Marie Astrid Garrido Campos, Benedikt Anselm Hindelang, Denise Siqueira De Carvalho, Ilse Urzúa Finke, Ronald Herrera, Katja Radon",2018 Aug 31,"Background:
        
      
      Diving within artisanal fishing is a profession carried out by many men in coastal communities of southern Chile. These shellfish divers use surface supplied air for breathing. Among potential health threats are occupational accidents, decompression sickness and barotrauma. Repeated middle and inner ear barotrauma and decompression sickness of the ear may result in hearing loss.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the prevalence of hearing loss and related risk factors in artisanal shellfish divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study including 125 male shellfish divers was carried out in a coastal village in southern Chile. Participants were interviewed using a standard Spanish questionnaire adapted for this population. Hearing loss was assessed through audiometry. Any hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and other types of hearing loss (conduction, unilateral and mixed) were used as the outcomes. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were carried out to identify risk factors for hearing loss.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Median duration on the job was 25 years (range 1-52), 64% of divers had a low level of schooling and 52% reported not knowing how to use decompression tables. Most (86%) of the divers dove deeper than 30 meters exceeding the 20 meters permitted by law. The majority (80%) reported having experienced several episodes of type II decompression sickness during their working life. The prevalence of any type of hearing loss was 54.4%: 29.0% presented sensorineural hearing loss and 25.6% presented other types of hearing impairment. After adjustment for age and other potential risk factors, diving more than 25 years was the main predictor for all kinds of hearing loss under study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Hearing loss is frequent in artisanal shellfish divers and safety measures are limited. Although based on small numbers and lacking an unexposed comparison group, our results suggest the need for community-based interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835386/,2022-11-28 03:02:00 AM
The assessment and management of inner ear barotrauma in divers and recommendations for returning to diving,"Elizabeth J Elliott, David R Smart, Elizabeth J Elliott, David R Smart",2014 Dec,"Inner ear barotrauma (IEBt) constitutes a spectrum of pressure-related pathology in the inner ear, with antecedent middle ear barotrauma (MEBt) common. IEBt includes perilymph fistula, intralabyrinthine membrane tear, inner ear haemorrhage and other rarer pathologies. Following a literature search, the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IEBt in divers and best-practice recommendations for returning to diving were reviewed. Sixty-nine papers/texts were identified and 54 accessed. Twenty-five case series (majority surgical) provided guidance on diagnostic pathways; nine solely reported divers. IEBt in divers may be difficult to distinguish from inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS), and requires dive-risk stratification and careful interrogation regarding diving-related ear events, clinical assessment, pure tone audiometry, a fistula test and electronystagmography (ENG). Once diagnosed, conservative management is the recommended first line therapy for IEBt. Recompression does not appear to cause harm if the diagnosis (IEBt vs IEDCS) is doubtful (limited case data). Exploratory surgery is indicated for severe or persisting vestibular symptoms or hearing loss, deterioration of symptoms, or lack of improvement over 10 days indicating significant pathology. Steroids are used, but without high-level evidence. It may be possible for divers to return to subaquatic activity after stakeholder risk acceptance and informed consent, provided: (1) sensorineural hearing loss is stable and not severe; (2) there is no vestibular involvement (via ENG); (3) high-resolution computed tomography has excluded anatomical predilection to IEBt and (4) education on equalising techniques is provided. There is a need for a prospective data registry and controlled trials to better evaluate diagnostic and treatment algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25596834/,2022-11-28 03:02:01 AM
Cancer risk among professional inshore divers in Norway,"Ågot Irgens, Marit Grønning, Ågot Irgens, Marit Grønning",2013,"Background:
        
      
      Professional divers are exposed to physiological effects of increased ambient pressure and may be exposed to hazards like carcinogens in polluted breathing gas and water. Consequences in terms of adverse health effects and mortality have been debated for many years.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to compare the risk of cancer in Norwegian professional divers to that of the general population.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      All professional divers born 1950-1990 and registered by compulsory notification in The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority's registry of divers were included and grouped according to the type of diving certificate. By August 2010, 5,526 male divers were identified. The rest of the male population born in the same period (1,591,243) was used as referents. The Cancer Registry of Norway, based on compulsory notification of all diagnosed malignancies, was linked to the Diver Registry.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A higher risk of cancer, OR 1.54 (CI 1.21-1.96), was observed among fully certified divers compared to the referents. No excess risk was observed for professional divers with limited certificate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Norwegian fully certified divers had higher risk of cancer compared to the Norwegian male population.

Physiological stress markers during breath-hold diving and SCUBA diving,"Marion Marlinge, Mathieu Coulange, Richard C Fitzpatrick, Romain Delacroix, Alexie Gabarre, Nicolas Lainé, Jennifer Cautela, Pierre Louge, Alain Boussuges, Jean-Claude Rostain, Régis Guieu, Fabrice C Joulia, Marion Marlinge, Mathieu Coulange, Richard C Fitzpatrick, Romain Delacroix, Alexie Gabarre, Nicolas Lainé, Jennifer Cautela, Pierre Louge, Alain Boussuges, Jean-Claude Rostain, Régis Guieu, Fabrice C Joulia",2019 Mar,"This study investigated the sources of physiological stress in diving by comparing SCUBA dives (stressors: hydrostatic pressure, cold, and hyperoxia), apneic dives (hydrostatic pressure, cold, physical activity, hypoxia), and dry static apnea (hypoxia only). We hypothesized that despite the hypoxia induces by a long static apnea, it would be less stressful than SCUBA dive or apneic dives since the latter combined high pressure, physical activity, and cold exposure. Blood samples were collected from 12SCUBA and 12 apnea divers before and after dives. On a different occasion, samples were collected from the apneic group before and after a maximal static dry apnea. We measured changes in levels of the stress hormones cortisol and copeptin in each situation. To identify localized effects of the stress, we measured levels of the cardiac injury markers troponin (cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), the muscular stress markers myoglobin and lactate), and the hypoxemia marker ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). Copeptin, cortisol, and IMA levels increased for the apneic dive and the static dry apnea, whereas they decreased for the SCUBA dive. Troponin, BNP, and myoglobin levels increased for the apneic dive, but were unchanged for the SCUBA dive and the static dry apnea. We conclude that hypoxia induced by apnea is the dominant trigger for the release of stress hormones and cardiac injury markers, whereas cold or and hyperbaric exposures play a minor role. These results indicate that subjects should be screened carefully for pre-existing cardiac diseases before undertaking significant apneic maneuvers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30912280/,2022-11-28 03:02:03 AM
Lung collapse in the diving sea lion: hold the nitrogen and save the oxygen,"Birgitte I McDonald, Paul J Ponganis, Birgitte I McDonald, Paul J Ponganis",2012 Dec 23,"Lung collapse is considered the primary mechanism that limits nitrogen absorption and decreases the risk of decompression sickness in deep-diving marine mammals. Continuous arterial partial pressure of oxygen profiles in a free-diving female California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) revealed that (i) depth of lung collapse was near 225 m as evidenced by abrupt changes in during descent and ascent, (ii) depth of lung collapse was positively related to maximum dive depth, suggesting that the sea lion increased inhaled air volume in deeper dives and (iii) lung collapse at depth preserved a pulmonary oxygen reservoir that supplemented blood oxygen during ascent so that mean end-of-dive arterial was 74 ± 17 mmHg (greater than 85% haemoglobin saturation).

Microvascular characteristics of the acoustic fats: Novel data suggesting taxonomic differences between deep and shallow-diving odontocetes,"Molly K Gabler, D Mark Gay, Andrew J Westgate, Heather N Koopman, Molly K Gabler, D Mark Gay, Andrew J Westgate, Heather N Koopman",2018 Apr,"Odontocetes have specialized mandibular fats, the extramandibular (EMFB) and intramandibular fat bodies (IMFB), which function as acoustic organs, receiving and channeling sound to the ear during hearing and echolocation. Recent strandings of beaked whales suggest that these fat bodies are susceptible to nitrogen (N2 ) gas embolism and empirical evidence has shown that the N2 solubility of these fat bodies is higher than that of blubber. Since N2 gas will diffuse from blood into tissue at any blood/tissue interface and potentially form gas bubbles upon decompression, it is imperative to understand the extent of microvascularity in these specialized acoustic fats so that risk of embolism formation when diving can be estimated. Microvascular density was determined in the EMFB, IMFB, and blubber from 11 species representing three odontocete families. In all cases, the acoustic tissues had less (typically 1/3 to 1/2) microvasculature than did blubber, suggesting that capillary density in the acoustic tissues may be more constrained than in the blubber. However, even within these constraints there were clear phylogenetic differences. Ziphiid (Mesoplodon and Ziphius, 0.9 ± 0.4% and 0.7 ± 0.3% for EMFB and IMFB, respectively) and Kogiid families (1.2 ± 0.2% and 1.0 ± 0.01% for EMFB and IMFB, respectively) had significantly lower mean microvascular densities in the acoustic fats compared to the Delphinid species (Tursiops, Grampus, Stenella, and Globicephala, 1.3 ± 0.3% and 1.3 ± 0.3% for EMFB and IMFB, respectively). Overall, deep-diving beaked whales had less microvascularity in both mandibular fats and blubber compared to the shallow-diving Delphinids, which might suggest that there are differences in the N2 dynamics associated with diving regime, phylogeny, and tissue type. These novel data should be incorporated into diving physiology models to further understand potential functional disruption of the acoustic tissues due to changes in normal diving behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29178494/,2022-11-28 03:02:04 AM
A diver's dilemma - a case report on bronchopulmonary sequestration,"Timothy Xin Zhong Tan, Andrew Yunkai Li, James Jie Sng, Mark Lim, Zhi Xiang Tan, Hope Xian'en Ang, Boon Hor Ho, David Zhiwei Law, Anne Ann Ling Hsu, Timothy Xin Zhong Tan, Andrew Yunkai Li, James Jie Sng, Mark Lim, Zhi Xiang Tan, Hope Xian'en Ang, Boon Hor Ho, David Zhiwei Law, Anne Ann Ling Hsu",2020 May 4,"Background:
        
      
      An asymptomatic SCUBA (Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diver was discovered to have an intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration during routine pre-course screening. This is the first reported case of a diver who, having previously completed several recreational and military diving courses, was subsequently diagnosed with a congenital lung condition, possibly contraindicating diving. Presently, there is no available literature providing guidance on the diving fitness of patients with such a condition.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      An asymptomatic 26-year-old male diver was nominated to attend an overseas naval diving course. Prior to this, he had been medically certified to participate in, and had successfully completed other military and recreational diving courses. He had also completed several hyperbaric dives up to a depth of 50 m and 45 recreational dives up to a depth of 30 m. He did not have a history of diving-related injuries or complications. He had never smoked and did not have any medical or congenital conditions, specifically recurrent respiratory infections. As part of pre-course screening requirements, a lateral Chest X-ray was performed, which revealed a left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. This was subsequently diagnosed as a cavitatory left lower lobe intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration on Computed Tomography Thorax. The diver remains asymptomatic and well at the time of writing and has been accepted to participate in another overseas course involving only dry diving in a hyperbaric chamber, with no prerequisites for him to undergo surgery.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although bronchopulmonary sequestrations lack communication with the tracheobronchial tree, they may still contain pockets of air, even if not radiologically visible. This can be attributed to anomalous connections which link them to other bronchi, lung parenchyma and/or pores of Kohn. As such, there is a higher theoretical risk of pulmonary barotrauma during diving, leading to pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or cerebral arterial gas embolism. Taking these into consideration, the current clinical consensus is that bronchopulmonary sequestrations and all other air-containing lung parenchymal lesions should be regarded as contraindications to diving. Patients who have undergone definitive and uncomplicated surgical resection may be considered fit to dive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32366303/,2022-11-28 03:02:05 AM

      We evaluated the role of scuba diving on cardiovascular risk in a small group of divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We have enrolled 14 subjects (12 males and 1 female, mean age 49±12.2 years) undergone to scuba diving (one patient did not complete the period of observation due to the b-blocker treatment). We evaluated electrocardiographyc trace and we have measured QT and RR interval to calculate the QTc index (Bazzet, Fridericia, Hodges and Framingam index) and the Tpeak to Tend index and heart rate variability index before and after scuba diving activity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results of our study confirm that there is a statistically significant improvement of the RR and QT index but there is not a statistically significant increase of the QTc index (QT interval normalized by heart rate) evaluated before and after scuba diving. In the same cohort of subjects, we have noted a not statistically significant improvement of Tpeak to Tend index. Our study has underlined a statistically significant modification of the SD1 and SD2 indices representative of parasympathetic and orthosympathic activity. Scuba diving activity seems to not be associated with a statistically significant variation of the cardiovascular risk.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data confirm that non-linear analysis is characterized by a statistically significant variation of the neurovegetative tone mainly linked to an increased parasympathetic activity. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate these preliminary findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31311237/,2022-11-28 03:02:06 AM
Sports-related lung injury during breath-hold diving,"Tanja Mijacika, Zeljko Dujic, Tanja Mijacika, Zeljko Dujic",2016 Dec,"The number of people practising recreational breath-hold diving is constantly growing, thereby increasing the need for knowledge of the acute and chronic effects such a sport could have on the health of participants. Breath-hold diving is potentially dangerous, mainly because of associated extreme environmental factors such as increased hydrostatic pressure, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypothermia and strenuous exercise.In this article we focus on the effects of breath-hold diving on pulmonary function. Respiratory symptoms have been reported in almost 25% of breath-hold divers after repetitive diving sessions. Acutely, repetitive breath-hold diving may result in increased transpulmonary capillary pressure, leading to noncardiogenic oedema and/or alveolar haemorrhage. Furthermore, during a breath-hold dive, the chest and lungs are compressed by the increasing pressure of water. Rapid changes in lung air volume during descent or ascent can result in a lung injury known as pulmonary barotrauma. Factors that may influence individual susceptibility to breath-hold diving-induced lung injury range from underlying pulmonary or cardiac dysfunction to genetic predisposition.According to the available data, breath-holding does not result in chronic lung injury.

The participants were 263 military divers in the Royal Thai Navy, aged 22 to 55 years. The participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire and to undergo the examinations on hearing acuity and physical measurement. The average diving year was 16.1 years. The participants dived 2.1 times a week until to 132.3 fsw (4-5 ata) in average. Sixty-one percent of them had hearing loss. In order to determine the diving exposure dose for the participants, total diving depth was calculated from diving years, diving times a week and maximal diving depth. Multiple linear regression analysis showed the hearing level associated with total diving depth and the experience of no-decompression diving. This result suggests that the Royal Thai Navy should manage diving conditions for conserving hearing acuity of Thai naval divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30983377/,2022-11-28 03:02:08 AM
In-water recompression,"David J Doolette, Simon J Mitchell, David J Doolette, Simon J Mitchell",2018 Jun 30,"Divers suspected of suffering decompression illness (DCI) in locations remote from a recompression chamber are sometimes treated with in-water recompression (IWR). There are no data that establish the benefits of IWR compared to conventional first aid with surface oxygen and transport to the nearest chamber. However, the theoretical benefit of IWR is that it can be initiated with a very short delay to recompression after onset of manifestations of DCI. Retrospective analyses of the effect on outcome of increasing delay generally do not capture this very short delay achievable with IWR. However, in military training and experimental diving, delay to recompression is typically less than two hours and more than 90% of cases have complete resolution of manifestations during the first treatment, often within minutes of recompression. A major risk of IWR is that of an oxygen convulsion resulting in drowning. As a result, typical IWR oxygen-breathing protocols use shallower maximum depths (9 metres' sea water (msw), 191 kPa) and are shorter (1-3 hours) than standard recompression protocols for the initial treatment of DCI (e.g., US Navy Treatment Tables 5 and 6). There has been no experimentation with initial treatment of DCI at pressures less than 285 kPa since the original development of these treatment tables, when no differences in outcomes were seen between maximum pressures of 203 kPa (10 msw) and 285 kPa (18 msw) or deeper. These data and case series suggest that recompression treatment comprising pressures and durations similar to IWR protocols can be effective. The risk of IWR is not justified for treatment of mild symptoms likely to resolve spontaneously or for divers so functionally compromised that they would not be safe in the water. However, IWR conducted by properly trained and equipped divers may be justified for manifestations that are life or limb threatening where timely recompression is unavailable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888380/,2022-11-28 03:02:09 AM
SCUBA Medicine for otolaryngologists: Part I. Diving into SCUBA physiology and injury prevention,"Jonathan R Mallen, Daniel S Roberts, Jonathan R Mallen, Daniel S Roberts",2020 Jan,"Objectives:
        
      
      Introduce pertinent self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) physiology and corresponding terminology. Appreciate the scope of diving and related otolaryngological injury. Illustrate pathophysiologic mechanisms for diving injuries. Summarize strategies for ear, paranasal sinus, and lung barotrauma prevention, including medical optimization and autoinsufflation techniques.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a review of the available medical and diving literature in English, German, Spanish, Italian Turkish, and French to determine the degree of evidence or lack thereof behind recommendations for treating SCUBA divers. The databases of PubMed, Ovid Medline, and the Cochrane library, as well available textbooks, were queried for relevant data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Divers are subjected to large pressure gradients within the first few meters of descent. This can lead to gas embolism formation as well as barotrauma secondary to gas expansion/compression in potential closed spaces such as the middle ear, paranasal sinuses, and lungs. Physicians can minimize the risk of injury by counseling patients regarding proper equalization and descent/ascent techniques, and optimizing sinonasal and eustachian tube function. The use of decongestants is controversial.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Diving is an increasingly popular sport with predominantly otolaryngologic manifestations of injury and disease. Treating SCUBA divers requires a firm understanding of how physiology is altered underwater. This review presents the relevant background information using illustrations to understand the environmental forces acting on divers and how to prevent injury.

The Effect of Scuba Diving on Microleakage of a Class II Composite Restoration: An In-Vitro Study,"Maryam Shahnavazi, Behzad Salari, Reza Fekrazad, Maryam Shahnavazi, Behzad Salari, Reza Fekrazad",2021 Jun 19,"Persistent pressure change is a common phenomenon within scuba diving with various medical and dental sign side effects. This study evaluates the effect of simulated pressure change due to scuba diving on the microleakage of class II composite restoration. In our methodology, a total number of 150 intact bicuspids are divided into two main groups (A and B), and prepared for a class II composite restoration. The samples of each main group are divided into five subgroups to be prepared with different liners. Then samples are restored with the same resin composite material. The teeth in group A are thermocycled under the normal atmospheric pressure, while group B are thermocycled under simulated scuba diving conditions. The gingival microleakage is assessed based on dye penetration. The group B teeth show a significantly higher microleakage score than their equivalents in group A (p < 0.05). The subgroups without a liner have a higher microleakage score than the other subgroups (p < 0.05). The flowable composite shows the leased leakage scores followed by Nano ionomer, Resin Modified Glass Iononomer, GIOMER, and linerless groups (p < 0.05). Scuba diving could increase the risk of microleakage development beneath class II, a composite restoration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34205448/,2022-11-28 03:02:10 AM
Risk mitigation in divers with persistent (patent) foramen ovale,"Peter Wilmshurst, Peter Wilmshurst",2019 Jun 30,"In this issue, Anderson and colleagues report follow-up of divers who were found to have a persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO) or, in eleven cases, an atrial septal defect (ASD). In most divers diagnosis followed an episode of decompression illness (DCI). The efficacy of closure of the PFO/ASD in preventing future DCI was compared with conservative diving. They reported that in the closure group the occurrence of confirmed DCI decreased significantly compared with pre-closure, but in the conservative group this reduction was not significant.
    

      
      It is believed there are three requirements for a diver to suffer shunt-mediated DCI: A significant right-to-left shunt (usually a large PFO but sometimes an ASD or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation). Venous bubbles nucleated during decompression circumvent the lung filter by passing through the shunt. Target tissues are supersaturated with dissolved inert gas, so that they are able to amplify embolic bubbles. All three are required because DCI does not occur after contrast echocardiography when bubbles cross a right-to-left shunt.
    

      
      Therefore, there are two ways that a diver who has suffered shunt-mediated DCI may continue to dive - either their shunt is sealed or future dives should be so conservative that venous bubbles are not liberated and/or critical tissues are not able to amplify embolic bubbles.
    

      
      PFO/ASD closure will give divers a risk of DCI comparable to the risk in others without a right-to-left shunt, if the procedure adequately seals the shunt. Closure of the shunt will not prevent a diver suffering DCI by other mechanisms, such as when there is arterial gas embolism (AGE) as a result of pulmonary barotrauma or when the dive profile is provocative (e.g., if there is rapid ascent or missed decompression stops). Conservative diving will be effective only if all the dives performed are truly conservative and prevent bubble nucleation and/or amplification.
    

      
      The study by Anderson et al. has a number of serious limitations. The study was small with only 62 self-selected divers, who self-reported outcomes. Eleven divers had not had DCI when their PFO or ASD was detected. Initially 36 divers were classified as closure and 26 as conservative treatment, but six subjects crossed from the conservative group to the closure group. Three of the six dived in the conservative group before having closure and are classified in both groups depending on whether the dives performed were before or after closure. As a result, there were 42 in the closure group and 23 in the conservative group.
    

      
      Randomisation to the treatment groups was not possible and its absence results in imbalance. Because the closure group is approximately twice as large as the conservative group, similar changes in incidence would have a greater probability of achieving statistical significance in the former. Large shunts were present in more than three-quarters of the closure group but fewer than half of the conservative group. The authors have three definitions of a 'large' PFO, so the definition of large was inconsistent. All ASDs were considered to be large.
    

      
      When dealing with small numbers, one needs patient-level data, but that is lacking and may mask inconsistency in management. The divers were investigated and treated in at least 38 hospitals (some divers did not state where they were treated). We do not know what devices were used for PFO/ASD closure, and closure effectiveness varies, or what tests were performed to assess the effectiveness of closure.
    

      
      The primary end-point was not different between the two groups because only two episodes of confirmed DCI occurred in each group. The authors also considered a softer and subjective end-point, possible DCI.
    

      
      Crucially we are not told what the divers in the conservative group were told constitutes a conservative dive and whether it was consistent. Nor are we told whether they followed the advice given. That is important because it appears that incidence of possible DCI increased considerably in only the conservative group, which means either that the advice they were given on what constitutes a conservative dive was flawed, that the divers failed to follow good advice or that they frequently reported innocent symptoms as possible DCI, because knowledge that they had a PFO may have increased their reporting - introducing further bias.
    

      
      There should be assessment of whether DCI after the intervention was shunt-mediated or had another cause. For that assessment, one needs to know details of the dives resulting in symptoms, clinical manifestations and latency of onset.
    

      
      I have investigated 20 divers who had DCI after PFO closure. In five divers, a contrast echocardiogram showed a significant residual shunt. Typically, the diver had their closure procedure by a cardiologist lacking knowledge of diving medicine and no post-closure contrast echocardiogram was performed. In one case, the diver's PFO was closed but they had a residual pulmonary shunt that was not detected. In those cases where there is a significant residual shunt, the dive profiles, clinical manifestations and latencies of onset were typical of shunt-mediated DCI.
    

      
      Three divers, who had PFO closure with no residual shunt, subsequently had neurological symptoms with manifestations consistent with AGE secondary to pulmonary barotrauma. High resolution CT scans of their chests showed pulmonary bullae and emphysema.
    

      
      The remaining divers seen had no residual shunt but had performed highly provocative dives, usually much deeper than 50 metres' sea water (msw). The most recent case that I saw had dived to 102 metres' fresh water (mfw) in a lake at high altitude breathing trimix.
    

      
      In contrast, several hundred divers in whom I diagnosed a PFO and who elected to dive conservatively had not reported further DCI. I advised them that I have never seen shunt-mediated DCI after dives breathing air to depths of 15 msw or less provided no rules were broken. So I set that as the depth limit or allow them to dive to greater depths breathing nitrox so that there are equivalent partial pressures of nitrogen (e.g., 19 msw with nitrox 32 or 23 msw with nitrox 40) provided they use an air decompression table/algorithm. Alternatively, one can dive using the DCIEM recreational air diving table.
    

      
      Recurrence of DCI after PFO closure may be the result of a residual shunt or may have other causes. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the safety of 'conservative' diving unless one knows what the divers were advised constitutes conservative dives and whether they adhered to the advice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177512/,2022-11-28 03:02:10 AM

To better understand why sea turtles develop GE, we built a mathematical model to estimate partial pressures of N2 (PN2), O2 (PO2), and CO2 (PCO2) in the major body-compartments of diving loggerheads (Caretta caretta), leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea), and green turtles (Chelonia mydas). This model was adapted from a published model for estimating gas dynamics in marine mammals and penguins. To parameterize the sea turtle model, we used values gleaned from previously published literature and 22 necropsies. Next, we applied this model to data collected from free-roaming individuals of the three study species. Finally, we varied body-condition and cardiac output within the model to see how these factors affected the risk of GE. Our model suggests that cardiac output likely plays a significant role in the modulation of GE, especially in the deeper diving leatherback turtles. This baseline model also indicates that even during routine diving behavior, sea turtles are at high risk of GE. This likely means that turtles have additional behavioral, anatomical, and/or physiologic adaptions that serve to reduce the probability of GE but were not incorporated in this model. Identifying these adaptations and incorporating them into future iterations of this model will further reveal the factors driving GE in sea turtles.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34539425/,2022-11-28 03:02:12 AM
The evolution of scuba divers pulmonary edema,"Carl Edmonds, Carl Edmonds",2016 Mar-Apr,"The evolution of scuba divers pulmonary edema is described. When discovered in 1981, it was believed to be a cold-induced response in a submerged, otherwise healthy, scuba diver. The clinical features are described and discussed, as are the demographics. An alleged prevalence of 1.1% was complicated by problematic statistics and an apparent increase in reported cases. Recurrences both while diving and swimming or snorkeling were common. More recent case reports and surveys are described, identifying predisposing factors and associations, including cardiac pathology. Stress cardiomyopathies, reversible myocardial disorder or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, may complicate the presentation, especially in older females.

Assessing potential divers with a history of congenital heart disease,"Mark S Turner, Mark S Turner",2015 Jun,"This article describes a structured approach to assessing the medical fitness of potential divers who have a history of congenital heart disease. The importance of a complete and accurate cardiac history, including details of surgery and other interventions is emphasized. Specific assessment of intracardiac shunts, exercise capacity and ability to deal with the physical challenge of diving, risk of diving-included pulmonary oedema, of arrhythmia and of incapacity in case of arrhythmia and the consequences of surgical and catheter treatment are discussed, including the risks associated with lung injury and the pressure limitations of implanted devices like pacemakers. Clinical assessment will usually include echocardiography and exercise testing with additional investigations such as MRI scanning, CT of heart or lungs, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and ECG monitoring, as required. Examples of different congenital lesions are given applying this approach (atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, bicuspid aortic valve and the Fontan circulation).

We investigated the lung function of traditional shellfish divers in southern Chile and identified risk factors for reduced lung volumes in divers. In a cross-sectional study, we assessed lung function in traditional shellfish divers and fishermen from two fishing communities. Male divers and fishermen aged 18-60 years were recruited. Participants' health and diving habits were assessed via standardized questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests and multiple linear regression models were applied. Through door-to-door sampling, we recruited 112 divers and 63 fishermen (response 67%). Valid spirometries were obtained from 98 divers and 52 fishermen. Divers had higher values of forced vital capacity (FVC, Beta = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09; 0.47) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, Beta = 0.23, 95%-CI: 0.07; 0.39) compared to fishermen. Among divers, lower values of FVC (Beta = -0.35, 95%-CI: -0.65; -0.05) were found in those with a high diving frequency, while diving depth was associated with higher values of FVC (Beta = 0.28, 95%-CI = 0.04; 0.52).

Recreational technical diving part 2: decompression from deep technical dives,"David J Doolette, Simon J Mitchell, David J Doolette, Simon J Mitchell",2013 Jun,"Technical divers perform deep, mixed-gas 'bounce' dives, which are inherently inefficient because even a short duration at the target depth results in lengthy decompression. Technical divers use decompression schedules generated from modified versions of decompression algorithms originally developed for other types of diving. Many modifications ostensibly produce shorter and/or safer decompression, but have generally been driven by anecdote. Scientific evidence relevant to many of these modifications exists, but is often difficult to locate. This review assembles and examines scientific evidence relevant to technical diving decompression practice. There is a widespread belief that bubble algorithms, which redistribute decompression in favour of deeper decompression stops, are more efficient than traditional, shallow-stop, gas-content algorithms, but recent laboratory data support the opposite view. It seems unlikely that switches from helium- to nitrogen-based breathing gases during ascent will accelerate decompression from typical technical bounce dives. However, there is evidence for a higher prevalence of neurological decompression sickness (DCS) after dives conducted breathing only helium-oxygen than those with nitrogen-oxygen. There is also weak evidence suggesting less neurological DCS occurs if helium-oxygen breathing gas is switched to air during decompression than if no switch is made. On the other hand, helium-to-nitrogen breathing gas switches are implicated in the development of inner-ear DCS arising during decompression. Inner-ear DCS is difficult to predict, but strategies to minimize the risk include adequate initial decompression, delaying helium-to-nitrogen switches until relatively shallow, and the use of the maximum safe fraction of inspired oxygen during decompression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813463/,2022-11-28 03:02:17 AM
Violations of safe diving practices among 122 diver fatalities,"Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Mark Caney, Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Mark Caney",2018,"Background:
        
      
      Diving is a popular recreation with an excellent safety record, with an estimated 1.8 deaths per 1 million dives. This study investigated the relationship between intentional deviation from accepted diving practices (violations) and diver fatalities.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The authors examined 119 incidents/122 diver fatalities that did not involve diver training in North America and the Caribbean, and identified the presence of violations of accepted diving safety practices, as well as if the death was associated with an acute medical event such as heart attack.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 122 fatalities, 57% (n = 70) were associated with a medical event and 43% (n = 52) were non-medical. Violations were found in 45% of fatalities (n = 55) overall. Violations were recorded for 23% of the 70 medical and 75% of the 52 non-medical fatalities. Divers who died from something other than a medical cause were 7 times as likely to have one or more violations associated with the fatality (OR 7.3, 95% CI 2.3-23.2). The odds of dying from something other than a medical condition increased approximately 60% for each additional 10 metres of depth. The odds of a death being associated with a medical condition increased approximately 9% per year of age, or 2.4 times for every 10 years older a diver was.

      Medical events are associated with over half of the non-training related diver fatalities in North America and the Caribbean, with the odds of death being associated with a medical condition doubling each decade of additional age. These data support recommendations that divers stay physically fit and have regular medical checkups, particularly as they get older.

However, improper diving may injure different organs. The majority of dive-related disorders concern otolaryngology, and may include hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, disequilibrium, and vertigo. Three main inner ear pathological conditions can occur underwater: inner ear barotrauma (IEB), inner ear decompression sickness (IEDS), and alternobaric vertigo (AV). IEB results from inappropriate equalization of middle ear pressure and consequent inner ear injury produced by pressure changes within the middle ear; IEDS is characterized by the formation of gas bubbles within the vessels of the inner ear during rapid ascent; AV typically develops while ascending or performing the Valsalva maneuver and can follow asymmetrical equalization of middle ear pressure transmitted via the oval and round window membranes. The clinical pictures of these pathological conditions are partly superimposable, even if they have specific peculiarities. Before starting SCUBA diving, a fit-to-dive assessment is recommended. It should include an otolaryngologic examination with audiological assessment to evaluate nasal, middle ear, and tubal patency and to minimize the risk of IEB, IEDS, and AV. It is of utmost importance to identify individual risk factors and predisposing pathological conditions that favor inner ear injury before diving, to prevent acute events and preserve auditory and vestibular functions in SCUBA divers. This review aims to provide an overview of the pathological conditions characterized by inner ear injury in SCUBA divers, discussing their pathogenetic mechanisms, diagnostic work-up, and prevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34100753/,2022-11-28 03:02:19 AM
Recreational diving-related injury insurance claims among Divers Alert Network Japan members: Retrospective analysis of 321 cases from 2010 to 2014,"Yasushi Kojima, Akiko Kojima, Yumi Niizeki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita, Yasushi Kojima, Akiko Kojima, Yumi Niizeki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Monitoring trends in diving-related injuries enables implementation of effective safety measures. Divers Alert Network Japan (DAN Japan) membership includes insurance covering recreational diving-related injuries and fatalities. Use of claim data provides both a known denominator and demographic data about injured members.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study analysed 325 insurance claims reported to DAN Japan from 2010 to 2014. Four fatalities were excluded, leaving 321 claims for analysis. Claimants were divided into three age groups: young adults (< 40 years); middle-aged (40-59 years) and older adults (≥ 60 years). The total injury claims rate (ICR), decompression illness (DCI) rate (DCR) and trauma rate (TCR) were calculated. Differences between the sexes within each age group were analysed.

      The total number of DAN Japan member-years in the period was 80,617, with a mean age of 45 years. Claims were made by 153 males and 168 females with a mean and median age of 46 years. Trauma was the most frequent reason for a claim (113 cases, 35%), followed by DCI (109 cases, 34%). The ICR (per 104 member-years) was 39.8 (95% confidence interval 35.5 to 44.2) and the TCR was 14.0 (11.4 to 16.6). For every age group, the ICR and TCR were significantly higher for females than males. The DCR was 13.5 (11.0 to 16.1) and did not significantly differ between the sexes.

Diving into the rat plasma proteome to get to the bottom of decompression sickness,"Ingrid Eftedal, Ingrid Eftedal",2016 Jul,"Decompression sickness (DCS) is the collective term for an array of signs and symptoms triggered by ambient pressure reduction. It is of particular concern to divers as they decompress on ascend from depth to sea surface, but despite a long history of studies the determinants of DCS risk are incompletely understood and there are no validated biomarkers. In this issue of Proteomics Clinical Applications, Lautridou et al. [8] report on their search for DCS biomarkers in rats exposed to simulated diving. By comparing the plasma proteomes from animals showing neurological symptoms to those emerging from dives unaffected, they identified several high-abundance proteins not previously associated with DCS. The most significant finding was a near depletion of thyroxine- and vitamin A transporter transthyretin in symptomatic rats. In addition to their potential role as diagnostic biomarkers, the proteins identified in Lautridou's study may offer new pieces in the yet incomplete puzzle of DCS etiology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27196271/,2022-11-28 03:02:21 AM
Predicted nine-year risk of diabetes among professional divers: a prospective study,"Richard Pougnet, Marie Uguen, Grégoire Verdier, Laurence Pougnet, David Lucas, Brice Loddé, Jean-Dominique Dewitte, Richard Pougnet, Marie Uguen, Grégoire Verdier, Laurence Pougnet, David Lucas, Brice Loddé, Jean-Dominique Dewitte",2015,"Background:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to assess diabetes predictive score for professional divers followed-up in one medical centre in France.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This prospective study, performed during 2013, included professional divers who were followed in a French maritime medicine centre. Data about their professional history of diving and dive profiles were collected. The clinical and biological data collected included: age, waist circumference, biometrics, body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure, practicing sports, glycaemia, triglyceridaemia, total cholesterolaemia, HDL and LDL cholesterolaemia. The predicted 9-year risk of diabetes was calculated according to the DESIRE score. Data were analysed using Epidata® software, by Pearson c2 test or by Fisher's exact test, by analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test, and by Spearman correlation coefficient.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of the 64 deep-sea divers taking part in the study, diabetes risk was estimated for 60 divers. The predictive 9-year risk of diabetes was higher than 10% for 31.7% of the divers and higher than 30% for 6.7% of the divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In France, people with diabetes have been declared definitely medically unfit to dive. The interest to assess the prevalence of risk factors and the predictive risk of diabetes arises from the need for prevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26119678/,2022-11-28 03:02:22 AM
Gas in Joints After Diving: Computed Tomography May Be Useful for Diagnosing Decompression Sickness,"Kei Jitsuiki, Yoshihiro Kushida, Ryota Nishio, Youichi Yanagawa, Kei Jitsuiki, Yoshihiro Kushida, Ryota Nishio, Youichi Yanagawa",2021 Mar,"A 26-y-old experienced scotoma scintillans after 59 min of scuba diving at a maximum depth of 26 m. After the patient smoked a cigarette, the scotoma scintillans ceased. However, he then developed a headache, general fatigue, and shoulder and elbow pain. He therefore called an ambulance. Based on the rules of the medical cooperative system for decompression sickness in Izu Peninsula, the fire department called a physician-staffed helicopter. After a physician checked the patient, his complaints remained aside from a low-grade fever. A portable ultrasound revealed bubbles in his inferior vena cava. Because of the risk of his being infected with COVID-19, he was transported to our hospital not by air evacuation but via ground ambulance staff while receiving a drip infusion of fluid and oxygen. After arriving at the hospital, his symptoms had almost subsided. Whole-body computed tomography revealed gas around the bladder, left hip, right knee, bilateral shoulder, joints, and right intramedullary humerus. The patient received high-concentration oxygen, infusion therapy, and observational admission. On the second day of admission, his symptoms had completely disappeared, and he was discharged. To our knowledge, this is the first report that computed tomography might be useful for detecting gas in multiple joints, suggesting the onset of decompression sickness after diving. This might be the first report of gas in an intramedullary space after diving as a potential cause of dysbaric osteonecrosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33309396/,2022-11-28 03:02:22 AM

Diving behavior of artisanal fishermen has been directed mainly to target high-value species. The aim of this study was to learn about the occurrence of DCS derived from sea cucumber harvesting in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. We conducted a retrospective chart review of diving fishermen treated at a multiplace hyperbaric chamber in Tizimín, Mexico. In total, 233 recompression therapies were rendered to 166 diving fishermen from 2014 to 2016. The average age was 36.7 ± 9.2 years (range: 20-59 years); 84.3% had experienced at least one DCS event previously. There was a correlation between age and DCS incidents (F: 8.3; R2: 0.07) and differences in the fishing depth between seasons (H: 9.99; p⟨0.05). Musculoskeletal pain was the most frequently reported symptom. Three divers, respectively, suffered permanent hearing loss, spinal cord injury and fatal outcome. Diving fishermen experience DCS at an alarmingly high rate, probably due to the type of species targeted, given the requirements in each case.

The data from 2001 to 2016 of patients had been collected und retrospectively evaluated using the electronic database of the emergency center of the university hospital in Bern, Switzerland. Barotrauma of the ear (69.0 %), decompression accidents (20.7 %) as well as cardiovascular complications (13.8 %) appeared quite frequently during scuba diving in Switzerland. In contrast, otitis occurred only at a very low percentage (3.5 %). The risk of diving accidents is clearly underestimated.

Evaluating the risk of decompression sickness for a yo-yo dive using a rat model,"Dror Ofir, Yoav Yanir, Amir Abramovich, Ronen Bar, Yehuda Arieli, Dror Ofir, Yoav Yanir, Amir Abramovich, Ronen Bar, Yehuda Arieli",2016 Jul-Aug,"Purpose:
        
      
      The frequent ascents made during yo-yo diving may contribute to gas bubble clearance but paradoxically may also increase the risk of central nervous system decompression illness (DCI). We evaluated the risk of DCI due to yo-yo dives with very short surface intervals, using a controlled animal model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Dives were conducted on air to a depth of 90 meters (10 atmospheres absolute) for 32 minutes of bottom time, at a descent/ascent rate of 10 meters/ minute. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ~ 300 grams were divided randomly into three groups. Group A performed a square dive protocol without any surface intervals, Group B conducted a protocol that included two surface intervals during the dive, and Group C performed a protocol with three surface intervals. Ascent/descent rate for surface intervals, each lasting one minute, was also 10 meters/minute.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Manifestations of DCI were observed in 13 of 16 animals in Group A (81.3%), six of 12 in Group B (58.3%), and two of 12 in Group C (16.7%). Mortality rates were similar in all groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surface intervals during dives breathing air significantly reduced DCI risk in the rat. Further studies are required using a larger animal model to reinforce the results of the present investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28763169/,2022-11-28 03:02:24 AM
"A prospective analysis of injury rates, patterns and causes in Cliff and Splash Diving","Lukas Ernstbrunner, Armin Runer, Paul Siegert, Matthäus Ernstbrunner, Johannes Becker, Thomas Freude, Herbert Resch, Philipp Moroder, Lukas Ernstbrunner, Armin Runer, Paul Siegert, Matthäus Ernstbrunner, Johannes Becker, Thomas Freude, Herbert Resch, Philipp Moroder",2017 Oct,"Introduction:
        
      
      Information about injuries and its differences in Cliff Diving (CD) and Splash Diving (SD) are unknown. It was the aim to analyse (1) injury rates, patterns and causes; (2) differences (in injuries) between both disciplines; and to (3) identify targets for future injury prevention interventions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From April to November 2013, 81 cliff and 51 splash divers were prospectively surveyed with an encrypted, monthly e-mail-based questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During a total of 7857h diving with an average diving height of 13 (±7)m, an overall injury rate of 7.9 injuries/1000h of sport exposure was reported. Cliff divers most commonly suffered from injuries of the foot and ankle (18%; n=24) and neck and cervical spine (14%; n=19). In SD, the lower limb (52%; n=43) and lower back (23%; n=19) were most frequently involved. In 79% (n=49) of the cases, the injury happened while entering the water. Cliff divers were in 52% (n=15) of the injuries in a feet-first and in 14% (n=4) in a head-first position. Splash divers were in 45% (n=9) of the injuries in a back- or buttocks-first position. Most of the injuries were bruises (47%; n=104) and muscle strains (13%; n=28). The injury risk during practice was significantly higher than in competition (11.3 vs. 4.5 injuries/1000h; OR 2.5; p=0.001). The injury risk of experts (15.4/1000h exposure) was significantly higher than in professionals (6.3/1000h exposure; OR 2.4; 95% CI, 3.3-1.9; p<0.001), although the average diving height was significantly higher in professionals (19m±8 vs. 12m±6; p<0.001). Significantly more professionals performed dryland training compared to experts (p=0.006).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Most of the injuries are related to the water entry. The entry position plays a key role in injury patterns with pursuant differences comparing CD with SD. Although most of the injuries involved soft-tissue only, severe injuries have been reported. Targets for future injury prevention strategies include protection for the increased impaction at entry; adaption of the diving conditions in practice to those in competition; dryland training courses; and instruction of non-professional divers to teach appropriate diving techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28807431/,2022-11-28 03:02:25 AM

Method: This analysis used retrospective records from 156 navy divers and computed an odds ratio using cases of ADHD and cases of underwater accidents. Results: Although the odds ratio was increased, it failed to reach significance. Conclusion: We do not yet have statistical evidence suggesting that the risk for adverse underwater events is significantly increased among the ADHD group in this sample of navy divers.

The role of persistent foramen ovale and other shunts in decompression illness,"Peter T Wilmshurst, Peter T Wilmshurst",2015 Jun,"A persistent foramen ovale (PFO) and other types of right-to-left shunts are associated with neurological, cutaneous and cardiovascular decompression illness (DCI). A right-to-left shunt is particularly likely to be implicated in causation when these types of DCI occur after dives that are not provocative. It is believed that venous nitrogen bubbles that form after decompression pass through the shunt to circumvent the lung ﬁlter and invade systemic tissues supersaturated with nitrogen (or other inert gas) and as a result there is peripheral ampliﬁcation of bubble emboli in those tissues. Approximately a quarter of the population have a PFO, but only a small proportion of the population with the largest right-to-left shunts are at high risk of shunt-mediated DCI. The increased risk of DCI in people with migraine with aura is because migraine with aura is also associated with right-to-left shunts and this increased risk of DCI appears to be conﬁ ned to those with a large PFO or other large shunt. Various ultrasound techniques can be used to detect and assess the size of right-to-left shunts by imaging the appearance of bubble contrast in the systemic circulation after intravenous injection. In divers with a history of shunt-mediated DCI, methods to reduce the risk of recurrence include cessation of diving, modiﬁcation of future dives to prevent venous bubble liberation and transcatheter closure of a PFO.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165532/,2022-11-28 03:02:27 AM
Alternobaric vertigo and facial baroparesis caused by scuba diving and relieved by chewing pineapple: a case report,"Adam Bender-Heine, Zachary W Dillard, Matthew J Zdilla, Adam Bender-Heine, Zachary W Dillard, Matthew J Zdilla",2017 Nov-Dec,"Equalization of middle ear pressure is an important consideration for scuba divers. When middle ear pressure is asymmetric, a diver may experience alternobaric vertigo. Moreover, individuals with an underlying temporal bone dehiscence are predisposed to facial baroparesis. An understanding on behalf of fellow divers and emergency responders to recognize and differentiate facial baroparesis from decompression illness is critical. Misdiagnosis may lead to inappropriate treatment or unwarranted stoppage of diving. There have been a few dozen reported cases of facial baroparesis in the literature, but few have included firsthand accounts. This report describes an incidence of unilateral facial baroparesis preceded by alternobaric vertigo, with commentary from divers who witnessed the individual experiencing the facial paresis. The facial weakness in this case resolved within 15 minutes after the diver chewed on fresh pineapple. This report suggests that alternobaric vertigo may be a harbinger of facial baroparesis. Upon resurfacing divers should consider prophylactic measures that help to dilate the Eustachian tube such as chewing, yawning and swallowing in order to minimize the risk of middle ear pressure-induced vertigo or facial paresis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29281198/,2022-11-28 03:02:28 AM
Diving patterns and decompression sickness among South Korean fishery divers,"Su Gang Cha, Young Seok Byun, Man Joong Jeon, Joon Sakong, Su Gang Cha, Young Seok Byun, Man Joong Jeon, Joon Sakong",2019 Jan,"Objectives:
        
      
      We aimed to report the characteristics of diving practice and the incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) among South Korean fishery divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We sent out questionnaires to 215 registered boat owners, and 196 of the fishery divers responded. The questionnaire was comprised of demographical characteristics, diving-related characteristics, and experiences with DCS. DCS was classified into types I and II based on the symptoms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Their average length of career in fishery diving was 18.1 ± 8.5 years. They were working for 10.8 ± 1.9 months per year. The average bottom time was 74.7 ± 23.3 minutes, the average depth was 23.6 ± 6.8 m, and the average surface interval time was 20.7 ± 12.5 minutes. The incidence of DCS symptoms among the total participants was 84.7%. The incidence increased as working days per month and dives per day increased (P < 0.05). An increased average working depth and a short surface interval time tended to reflect an elevated incidence in the DCS symptoms (P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed working days per month, dives per day, average bottom time, and rapid ascent as risk factors (P < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      South Korean fishery divers were shown to be susceptible to DCS because of their repetitive dives for financial reasons. However, they are often beyond the scope of the law. The results of this study suggested that it is necessary to establish the registries of fishery divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30698347/,2022-11-28 03:02:28 AM
"A 20-year analysis of compressed gas diving-related deaths in Tasmania, Australia","Juan Carlos Ascencio-Lane, David Smart, John Lippmann, Juan Carlos Ascencio-Lane, David Smart, John Lippmann",2019 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study reviews diving deaths that occurred in Tasmanian waters over a 20-year period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Detailed analysis was undertaken of deaths that occurred from 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2014. The cases were collated from numerous sources. Utilising a chain of events analysis, factors were identified and assigned to predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and cause of death. These were then scrutinised to ascertain regional variables, remediable factors and linkages which may benefit from targeted risk mitigation strategies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventeen deaths were identified across this 20-year period, which included one additional case not previously recorded. All were recreational divers and 15 were male. Five were hookah divers, 12 were scuba divers. Important predisposing factors identified included equipment (condition and maintenance), pre-existing health conditions, diver experience and training. These factors can now be used to promote public health messages for divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This 20-year study highlighted regional variations for Tasmanian deaths and presents opportunities for strategies to prevent diving deaths in the future. Of particular concern was the diving practice of 'hookah' diving, which has no governing regulations.

Diving under the influence: issues in researching personality and inert gas narcosis,"Charles H Van Wijk, Jarred H Martin, Willem A J Meintjes, Charles H Van Wijk, Jarred H Martin, Willem A J Meintjes",2017,"Background:
        
      
      This paper considers the relationship between measures of personality and mood states, and susceptibility to inert gas narcosis. It briefly reviews the topics of inert gas narcosis affecting personality, and personality affecting the susceptibility to inert gas narcosis. There appears to be is a theoretical argument for a possible relationship between measures of personality, mood states, and susceptibility to narcosis. Practically, such a relationship may speak to issues in selection, training and preparation, risk assessments, and even accident investigation in the diving and/or hyperbaric environment.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Twenty one divers completed measures of personality and mood states, and were then compressed to 709 kPa (equivalent to 60 msw) in a dry compression chamber, where they completed a task measuring speed of information processing, and a scale measuring subjective narcosis.

She was found to have acute pulmonary edema radiographically. Her troponins were noted to be positive. Initial echocardiogram showed basal hypokinesis with hyperkinesis of apex. She was treated with noninvasive ventilation and intravenous diuretic therapy and her symptoms significantly improved. She subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease.

Right Bundle Branch Block,"Weston T. Harkness, Mary Hicks, Weston T. Harkness, Mary Hicks",,"Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is an electrocardiogram finding that occurs when the physiologic electrical conduction system of the heart, specifically in the His-Purkinje system, is altered or interrupted resulting in a widened QRS and electrocardiographic vector changes. The bundle of His divides in the interventricular septum into the right and left bundle branches. Initially, the right bundle branch off of the bundle of His travels down the interventricular septum near the endocardium. It then dives deeper into the muscular layer before re-emerging near the endocardium again. The right bundle branch receives most of its blood supply from the anterior descending coronary artery. It also receives collateral circulation from the right or left circumflex coronary arteries, depending on the dominance of the heart.
    

      
      Right bundle branch block is associated with structural changes from stretch or ischemia to the myocardium. It can also occur iatrogenically from certain common cardiac procedures, such as right heart catheterization. Although there is no significant association with cardiovascular risk factors, the presence of a right bundle branch block is a predictor of mortality in myocardial infarction, heart failure, and certain heart blocks. In asymptomatic patients, isolated right bundle branch block typically does not need further evaluation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29939649/,2022-11-28 03:02:32 AM
Back to the future: occupational diver training in Australia,"David Smart, David Smart",2017 Dec,"The Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) had its genesis in the 1990s in response to a need to produce occupational divers who were trained to international standards with the necessary skills to safely undertake complex work in high-risk environments. Well-trained dive teams who are 'fit-for-purpose' can be regarded as the highest level of risk control in preventing accidents and workplace morbidity. Without such training, work site risks are not detected, with potentially disastrous consequences. In September 2017, the only civilian ADAS level 3 and 4 training facility in Australia, The Underwater Centre Tasmania (TUCT), closed its doors. The reasons for TUCT closure were multifactorial. However, the loss of higher level training capability in this country and its benefits to industry will have a future adverse impact. As industry pushes for more complex diving to improve productivity, Australian occupational diver training processes are becoming 'streamlined' and are losing parity with international benchmarks.

      Among participants, 15.4% expressed difficulty in completing the RSTC form. Less than one-third (28.2%) replied 'all negative' to the questions. Some health conditions that could impose diving risks were not elicited by the questionnaire alone. Nevertheless, there was good sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value with the exception of a few questions. However, significant discrepancies were identified when comparing the English and Chinese versions. There was also uncertainty with aspects of implementation, including attitudes of the user and provider, reliability of self-declaration answers and the handling of completed questionnaires.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health screening with a questionnaire for recreational divers remains practical and acceptable. Full revision of the RSTC form in Chinese is recommended in view of problems with the construct validity and translation. People should be informed about the non-prescriptive approach of health assessment for recreational divers. Further research on the implementation of the form may help to improve the screening strategy in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157733/,2022-11-28 03:02:34 AM
Risk factors for immersion pulmonary edema in recreational scuba divers: a case-control study,"Anne Henckes, Guy Cochard, Florence Gatineau, Pierre Louge, Emmanuel Gempp, Sébastien Demaistre, Emmanuel Nowak, Yves Ozier, Anne Henckes, Guy Cochard, Florence Gatineau, Pierre Louge, Emmanuel Gempp, Sébastien Demaistre, Emmanuel Nowak, Yves Ozier",2019,"Background:
        
      
      Immersion can cause immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) in previously healthy subjects. We performed a case-control study to better identify IPE risk factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We prospectively included recreational scuba divers who had presented signs of IPE and control divers who were randomly chosen among diving members of the French Underwater Federation. We sent an anonymous questionnaire to each diver, with questions on individual characteristics, as well as the conditions of the most recent dive (controls) or the dive during which IPE occurred. Univariate logistic regressions were performed for each relevant factor. Then, multivariate logistic regression was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 882 questionnaires sent, 480 (54%) were returned from 88 cases (90%) and 392 control divers (50%). Multivariate analysis identified the following independent risk factors associated with IPE: being aged over 50 years ((OR) 3.30, (95%CI) 1.76-6.19); female sex (OR 2.20, 95%CI 1.19-4.08); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intake before diving (OR 24.32, 95%CI 2.86-206.91); depth of dive over 20 m (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.07-3.74); physical exertion prior to or during the dive (OR 5.51, 95%CI 2.69-11.28); training dive type (OR 5.34, 95%CI 2.62-10.86); and daily medication intake (OR 2.79, 95%CI 1.50-5.21); this latter factor appeared to be associated with hypertension in the univariate analysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      To reduce the risk of experiencing IPE, divers over 50 years of age or with hypertension, especially women, should avoid extensive physical effort, psychological stress, deep dives and NSAID intake before diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683358/,2022-11-28 03:02:35 AM
Early Predictors of Near-Shore Spinal Injuries Among Emergency Department Patients,"Tucker Lurie, Emilie Berman, Soha Hassan, Matthew Jackson, Jamie Falcon, Daniel Najafali, David Cowall, Bradford Schwartz, Stephen R Thom, Quincy K Tran, Tucker Lurie, Emilie Berman, Soha Hassan, Matthew Jackson, Jamie Falcon, Daniel Najafali, David Cowall, Bradford Schwartz, Stephen R Thom, Quincy K Tran",2021 Jan,"Background:
        
      
      Spinal injuries (SIs) can pose a significant burden to patients and family; delayed surgical intervention, associated with interhospital transfer, results in worse outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to identify early patient-centered factors associated with risk for near-shore SIs to assist clinicians with expeditious medical decision-making.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a multicenter retrospective study of all adults transported from Ocean City, Maryland to two emergency departments (EDs) and one regional trauma center for evaluation of suspected SIs from 2006 to 2017. Outcomes were any SI and any spinal cord injury (SCI). Multivariable logistic regression was performed for association of environmental and clinical factors with outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We analyzed 278 records, 102 patients (37%) were diagnosed with any SI and 41 (15%) were diagnosed with SCIs. Compared with patients without SI, patients with SI were more likely to be older (48 vs. 39 years), male (90% vs. 70%), with pre-existing spinal condition (62% vs. 33%), and injury caused by diving (11% vs. 2%). Multivariable logistic regression showed age (odd ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.11), diving (OR 3.5; 95% CI 3-100+), and wave height (OR 4.5; 95% CI 1.35-15.2) were associated with any SI, and a chief complaint of extremity numbness or tingling (OR 5.73; 95% CI 1.2-27.9) was associated with SCI.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We identified older age, diving, and higher wave height as risk factors for any SI and symptoms of numbness and tingling were associated with SCIs. Clinicians should consider expediting these patients' transfers to a trauma center with neurosurgical capability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32893065/,2022-11-28 03:02:36 AM
