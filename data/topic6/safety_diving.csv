Injuries and Fatalities Related to Freediving: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Michael F Allen, Deborah E Allen, Michael F Allen, Deborah E Allen",2022 Oct 16,"This case report and literature review aim to explore the range of injuries sustained in the sport of freediving. The case report involves a 37-year-old patient who sustained a pneumothorax secondary to freediving. We conducted the literature review to analyse the injuries associated with freediving. We used the combination of search terms 'freediving"", ""injuries"", and ""breath-hold diving"" on the database PubMed®. A total of 40 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The search revealed a wide range of ophthalmological, pulmonary, neurological, ear, nose, and throat injuries, along with several fatalities. Freediving is a sport performed in extreme environments and, if undertaken by inexperienced, untrained, or competition divers, can lead to severe injury or even death. However, the risk of damage can be reduced by performing it responsibly with the appropriate training and by using proper safety measures. Future research is warranted into the psychological, physiological, and economic benefits of freediving at both individual and community levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36407268/,2022-11-27 11:15:16 PM
Variation in Growth Drives the Duration of Parental Care: A Test of Ydenberg's Model,"Kyle H Elliott, Jannie F Linnebjerg, Chantelle Burke, Anthony J Gaston, Anders Mosbech, Morten Frederiksen, Flemming Merkel, Kyle H Elliott, Jannie F Linnebjerg, Chantelle Burke, Anthony J Gaston, Anders Mosbech, Morten Frederiksen, Flemming Merkel",2017 May,"The duration of parental care in animals varies widely, from none to lifelong. Such variation is typically thought to represent a trade-off between growth and safety. Seabirds show wide variation in the age at which offspring leave the nest, making them ideal to test the idea that a trade-off between high energy gain at sea and high safety at the nest drives variation in departure age (Ydenberg's model). To directly test the model assumptions, we attached time-depth recorders to murre parents (fathers [which do all parental care at sea] and mothers; [Formula: see text] of each). Except for the initial mortality experienced by chicks departing from the colony, the mortality rate at sea was similar to the mortality rate at the colony. However, energy gained by the chick per day was ∼2.1 times as high at sea compared with at the colony because the father spent more time foraging, since he no longer needed to spend time commuting to and from the colony. Compared with the mother, the father spent ∼2.6 times as much time diving per day and dived in lower-quality foraging patches. We provide a simple model for optimal departure date based on only (1) the difference in growth rate at sea relative to the colony and (2) the assumption that transition mortality from one life-history stage to the other is size dependent. Apparently, large variation in the duration of parental care can arise simply as a result of variation in energy gain without any trade-off with safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28410026/,2022-11-27 11:15:17 PM
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for intensive care patients: position statement by the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine,"Daniel Mathieu, Beatrice Ratzenhofer-Komenda, Jacek Kot, Daniel Mathieu, Beatrice Ratzenhofer-Komenda, Jacek Kot",2015 Mar,"Many of the accepted indications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may occur in critically ill patients. HBOT itself may cause a number of physiological changes which may further compromise the patient's state. Guidelines on the management of critically ill patients in a hyperbaric facility have been founded on the conclusions of the 2007 European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine (ECHM) meeting. With regard to patient management, HBOT should be included in the overall care of ICU patients only after a risk/benefit assessment related to the specifics of both the hyperbaric centre and the patient's clinical condition and should not delay or interrupt their overall management. Neither patient monitoring nor treatment should be altered or stopped due to HBOT, and any HBOT effects must be strictly evaluated and appropriately mitigated. With regard to the hyperbaric facility itself, the hyperbaric chamber should be specifically designed for ICU patients and should be fully equipped to allow continuation of patient monitoring and treatment. The hyperbaric chamber ideally should be located in, or around the immediate vicinity of the ICU, and be run by a sufficiently large and well-trained team of physicians, nurses, chamber operators and technicians. All devices to be introduced into the chamber should be evaluated, tested and acknowledged as safe for use in a hyperbaric environment and all procedures (standard and emergency) should be tested and written before being implemented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964038/,2022-11-27 11:18:26 PM
Health protection and risks for rescuers in cases of floods,"Nataša Janev Holcer, Pavle Jeličić, Maja Grba Bujević, Damir Važanić, Nataša Janev Holcer, Pavle Jeličić, Maja Grba Bujević, Damir Važanić",2015 Mar,"Floods can pose a number of safety and health hazards for flood-affected populations and rescuers and bring risk of injuries, infections, and diseases due to exposure to pathogenic microorganisms and different biological and chemical contaminants. The risk factors and possible health consequences for the rescuers involved in evacuation and rescuing operations during the May 2014 flood crisis in Croatia are shown, as well as measures for the prevention of injuries and illnesses. In cases of extreme floods, divers play a particularly important role in rescuing and first-response activities. Rescuing in contaminated floodwaters means that the used equipment such as diving suits should be disinfected afterwards. The need for securing the implementation of minimal health and safety measures for involved rescuers is paramount. Data regarding injuries and disease occurrences among rescuers are relatively scarce, indicating the need for medical surveillance systems that would monitor and record all injuries and disease occurrences among rescuers in order to ensure sound epidemiological data. The harmful effects of flooding can be reduced by legislation, improvement of flood forecasting, establishing early warning systems, and appropriate planning and education.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25741935/,2022-11-27 11:18:26 PM

Medical devices and procedures in the hyperbaric chamber,"Jacek Kot, Jacek Kot",2014 Dec,"The aim of this paper is to present current controversies concerning the safety of medical devices and procedures under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber including: defibrillation in a multiplace chamber; implantable devices during hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) and the results of a recent European questionnaire on medical devices used inside hyperbaric chambers. Early electrical defibrillation is the only effective therapy for cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The procedure of defibrillation under hyperbaric conditions is inherently dangerous owing to the risk of fire, but it can be conducted safely if certain precautions are taken. Recently, new defibrillators have been introduced for hyperbaric medicine, which makes the procedure easier technically, but it must be noted that sparks and fire have been observed during defibrillation, even under normobaric conditions. Therefore, delivery of defibrillation shock in a hyperbaric environment must still be perceived as a hazardous procedure. Implantable devices are being seen with increasing frequency in patients referred for HBOT. These devices create a risk of malfunction when exposed to hyperbaric conditions. Some manufacturers support patients and medical practitioners with information on how their devices behave under increased pressure, but in some cases an individual risk-benefit analysis should be conducted on the patient and the specific implanted device, taking into consideration the patient's clinical condition, the indication for HBOT and the capability of the HBOT facility for monitoring and intervention in the chamber. The results of the recent survey on use of medical devices inside European hyperbaric chambers are also presented. A wide range of non-CE-certified equipment is used in European chambers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25596835/,2022-11-27 11:18:28 PM
The duration of two carbon dioxide absorbents in a closed-circuit rebreather diving system,"David Harvey, Neal W Pollock, Nicholas Gant, Jason Hart, Peter Mesley, Simon J Mitchell, David Harvey, Neal W Pollock, Nicholas Gant, Jason Hart, Peter Mesley, Simon J Mitchell",2016 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Diving rebreathers use canisters containing sodalime preparations to remove carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the expired gas. These preparations have a limited absorptive capacity and therefore may limit dive duration. The Inspiration™ rebreather is designed for use with Sofnolime 797™ but some divers use Spherasorb™ as an alternative. There are no published data comparing the CO2-absorbing efficacy of these sodalime preparations in an Inspiration rebreather.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An Inspiration rebreather was operated in a benchtop circuit under conditions simulating work at 6 metabolic equivalents (MET). Ventilation was maintained at 45 L·min⁻¹ (tidal volume 1·5 L; respiratory rate 30 min⁻¹) with CO₂ introduced to the expiratory limb at 2·L·min⁻¹. The PiCO₂ was continuously monitored in the inspiratory limb. The rebreather canister was packed to full volume with either Sofnolime or Spherasorb and 10 trials were conducted (five using each absorbent), in which the circuit was continuously run until the PiCO₂ reached 1 kPa ('breakthrough'). Peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures during tidal ventilation of the circuit were also recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean operating duration to CO₂ breakthrough was 138 ± 4 (SD) minutes for 2.38·kg Spherasorb and 202 ± minutes for 2.64·kg Sofnolime (P < 0.0001). The difference between peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures was 10% less during use of Spherasorb, suggesting lower work of breathing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Under conditions simulating work at 6 MET during use of an Inspiration rebreather a canister packed with Spherasorb reached CO₂ breakthrough 32% earlier with 10% less mass than Sofnolime packed to similar volume. Divers cannot alternate between these two preparations and expect the same endurance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27334997/,2022-11-27 11:18:28 PM
"Hyperbaric Treatment Of Compressed Air Workers, Caissons, Tunneling, Bounce Diving, and Saturation Diving","Owen J. ONeill, Anthony Haftel, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie, Owen J. ONeill, Anthony Haftel, Heather M. Murphy-Lavoie",,"The field of compressed air work (CAW) includes caisson workers, tunnel workers, commercial divers, and inside observers working in multiplace hyperbaric chambers and any environment with increased atmospheric pressure. To summarize, this field includes all workers who perform duties at increased atmospheric pressure. This article will reference all of the workers in these varied environments as compressed air workers (CAWs). CAWs use compressed air during tunneling jobs to prevent flooding by groundwater and/or the entrance of toxic substances such as methane gas. The CAW field has undergone significant change since tunnels and caissons were first constructed in the 1800s. Between that time and the early 1980s, tunnels were primarily excavated by hand by workers exposed to the extremes of increased atmospheric pressure. There was a high incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) among caisson workers (CAWs), commonly referred to as the bends, due to the ""bent over"" bodily posture workers assumed secondary to the pain in the hips and spine caused by DCS. Pile driving has since replaced much of the need for compressed air caisson work. Skilled and well trained commercial divers perform underwater compressed air work. Their risk of decompression sickness and air gas embolism gets mitigated through the use of well designed academic diving education programs and the use of continuously updated decompression tables and modeling. On-site hyperbaric chambers and medical teams are necessary for specific job sites depending on the conditions and depth of the work. Regulations for compressed air work are on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website under standard number 1926.803-Compressed Air. Despite all attempts to mitigate risk, tunnel CAWs may still suffer the signs and symptoms of DCS and a variety of other typical construction work-related hazards. This paper will discuss CAWs performance in dry hyperbaric environments, particularly those pertaining to tunnel and caisson work, as well as the different methods of compression used to keep them safe and the job productive and cost-effective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31194360/,2022-11-27 11:18:29 PM

Here, we present new insights on the ontogeny of the microscopic anatomy of the terminal portion of the airways of the lungs in five cetacean species: the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus); the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), the Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris); the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus); and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). We (a) studied the histology of the terminal portion of the airways; (b) used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to characterize the muscle fibers with antibodies against smooth muscle (sm-) actin, sm-myosin, and desmin; (c) the innervation of myoelastic sphincters (MESs) with an antibody against neurofilament protein; and (d) defined the diameter of the terminal bronchioles, the diameter and length of the alveoli, the thickness of the septa, the major and minor axis, perimeter and section area of the cartilaginous rings by quantitative morphometric analyses in partially inflated lung tissue. As already reported in the literature, in bottlenose and striped dolphins, a system of MESs was observed in the terminal bronchioles. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of smooth muscle in the terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar septa in all the examined species. Some neurofilaments were observed close to the MESs in both bottlenose and striped dolphins. In fin, sperm, and Cuvier's beaked whales, we noted a layer of longitudinal smooth muscle going from the terminal bronchioles to the alveolar sacs. The morphometric analysis allowed to quantify the structural differences among cetacean species by ranking them into groups according to the adjusted mean values of the morphometric parameters measured. Our results contribute to the current understanding of the anatomy of the terminal airways of the cetacean lung and the role of the smooth muscle in the alveolar collapse reflex, crucial for prolonged breath-holding diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33338275/,2022-11-27 11:18:30 PM
Effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction,"Joëlle Vincent, Marie-Kristelle Ross, Neal W Pollock, Joëlle Vincent, Marie-Kristelle Ross, Neal W Pollock",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) is available to a wide spectrum of patients, many with significant co-morbidities. Considering its effects on cardiac physiology and reports of pulmonary oedema following exposure, concerns exist about the safety of patients with compromised cardiac function. Few studies have described adverse events occurring during HBOT and even fewer reports address events arising in the hours following HBOT. A relation between adverse events and cardiac function has not been established. As medical guidance is limited, we aimed to evaluate the risk for patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) receiving HBOT.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective chart review of patients receiving HBOT from April 2003 through December 2019 at our hospital was designed to describe clinical characteristics of patients and to identify adverse events during HBOT and within 24 hours after HBOT. Patients ≥ 40 years of age with a documented LVEF of ≤ 40% were included. Data are presented as mean (SD) [range] or counts, as appropriate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 23 patients were included in the final analysis, 2 (1) [0-4] patients per year. Patients received 25 (19) [1-60] treatments. Two patients had an episode of acute decompensated heart failure possibly linked to HBOT.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study described the clinical characteristics of patients with reduced LVEF receiving HBOT and showed reassuring results, with a majority of patients with reduced LVEF tolerating HBOT well. Prospective research is required to more fully assess the risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547776/,2022-11-27 11:18:30 PM
Is it safe to SCUBA dive with asthma?,"Megan Dp Gore, Giles Dixon, Andrew E Stanton, Megan Dp Gore, Giles Dixon, Andrew E Stanton",2019 Nov,"Introduction: Internationally it is estimated that six million people participate in self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving each year. Registries suggest a significant proportion of divers have a current or historical diagnosis of asthma. Previously individuals with asthma were prohibited from diving, however, several contemporary guidelines suggest a select population of patients with asthma may be able to dive with an acceptable degree of risk. Areas covered: Divers with asthma may be at an increased risk of a variety of diving-related medical injuries including; pulmonary barotrauma (PBT), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, arterial gas embolism (AGE), reduction in pulmonary function, bronchospasm and decompression sickness (DCS). This article will discuss the latest evidence on the incidence of adverse events in diving with a focus on those caused by asthma.

Recreational technical diving part 1: an introduction to technical diving methods and activities,"Simon J Mitchell, David J Doolette, Simon J Mitchell, David J Doolette",2013 Jun,"Technical divers use gases other than air and advanced equipment configurations to conduct dives that are deeper and/or longer than typical recreational air dives. The use of oxygen-nitrogen (nitrox) mixes with oxygen fractions higher than air results in longer no-decompression limits for shallow diving, and faster decompression from deeper dives. For depths beyond the air-diving range, technical divers mix helium, a light non-narcotic gas, with nitrogen and oxygen to produce 'trimix'. These blends are tailored to the depth of intended use with a fraction of oxygen calculated to produce an inspired oxygen partial pressure unlikely to cause cerebral oxygen toxicity and a nitrogen fraction calculated to produce a tolerable degree of nitrogen narcosis. A typical deep technical dive will involve the use of trimix at the target depth with changes to gases containing more oxygen and less inert gas during the decompression. Open-circuit scuba may be used to carry and utilise such gases, but this is very wasteful of expensive helium. There is increasing use of closed-circuit 'rebreather' devices. These recycle expired gas and potentially limit gas consumption to a small amount of inert gas to maintain the volume of the breathing circuit during descent and the amount of oxygen metabolised by the diver. This paper reviews the basic approach to planning and execution of dives using these methods to better inform physicians of the physical demands and risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813462/,2022-11-27 11:18:32 PM
Understanding a population: A methodology for a population-based coastal safety survey,"Jasmin C Lawes, Lea Uebelhoer, William Koon, Luke Strasiotto, Frederic Anne, Shane Daw, Robert W Brander, Nick Mulcahy, Amy E Peden, Jasmin C Lawes, Lea Uebelhoer, William Koon, Luke Strasiotto, Frederic Anne, Shane Daw, Robert W Brander, Nick Mulcahy, Amy E Peden",2021 Aug 13,"Drowning is a global public health problem, but accurately estimating drowning risk remains a challenge. Coastal drowning comprises a significant proportion of the drowning burden in Australia and is influenced by a range of behavioural factors (e.g. risk perception, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours) that are poorly understood. These factors, along with those that impact exposure (e.g. coastal visitation and activity participation) all impact on drowning risk. While excellent mortality and morbidity data exists in Australia, a lack of coastal participation data presents challenges to identifying high-risk groups or activities and prioritising prevention efforts. This methods paper describes the development and evolution of an ongoing, annual, nationally representative online survey as an effective tool used to capture valuable data about the Australian population's relationship with the coast. This paper explores how the survey is structured (12-14 sections spanning multiple topics and themes), the different question types used (including open text, 4-digit responses and categorical questions), the sample size (1400-1600 respondents), sampling strategy (using demographic quota sampling which can then be post-weighted to the population if required) and how topics and themes have changed over time to enhance the quality of data collected (i.e., wording changes to enhance participant comprehension or data usability and changing issue-specific 'feature' topics of interest such as campaign evaluation). How the survey is implemented online is described, both practically through to third-party recruitment processes and ethically to maximise anonymity of respondents and ensure data quality. Interim analyses indicate the impact of considering exposure when calculating fatal drowning rates, especially by activity (e.g., crude boating drowning rate 0.12 per 100,000 population vs 0.95 per 100,000 exposed population [relative risk = 8.01; 95% confidence interval: 4.55-14.10]). This study highlights lessons learned in the process of conducting a nationally representative coastal participation survey as well as the strengths and limitations of adopting this approach. Data collected will provide more detailed information on the skills, behaviours, knowledge and attitudes of coastal activity participants. Analyses of this unique dataset will inform research that will underpin development and evaluation of coastal drowning prevention initiatives prioritising those most at risk. It is hoped that the methods detailed within this study may be useful for other countries to develop similar approaches to understanding their own population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34388222/,2022-11-27 11:18:33 PM

Chain of events analysis for a scuba diving fatality,"John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, Jo Williams, Mohammadreza Mohebbi, John Lippmann, Christopher Stevenson, David McD Taylor, Jo Williams, Mohammadreza Mohebbi",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      A scuba diving fatality usually involves a series of related events culminating in death. Several studies have utilised a chain of events-type analysis (CEA) to isolate and better understand the accident sequence in order to facilitate the creation of relevant countermeasures. The aim of this research was to further develop and better define a process for performing a CEA to reduce potential subjectivity and increase consistency between analysts.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      To develop more comprehensive and better-defined criteria, existing criteria were modified and a template was created and tested using a CEA. Modifications comprised addition of a category for pre-disposing factors, expansion of criteria for the triggers and disabling agents present during the incident, and more specific inclusion criteria to better encompass a dataset of 56 fatalities. Four investigators (raters) used both the previous criteria and this template, in randomly assigned order, to examine a sample of 13 scuba diver deaths. Individual results were scored against the group consensus for the CEA. Raters' agreement consistency was compared using the Index of Concordance and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The template is presented. The index of concordance between the raters increased from 62% (194⁄312) using the previous criteria to 82% (257⁄312) with use of this template indicating a substantially higher inter-rater agreement when allocating criteria. The agreement in scoring with and without template use was also quantified by ICC which were generally graded as low, illustrating a substantial change in consistency of scoring before and after template use.

Incidence and Features of Barodontalgia Among Military Divers,"Mathieu Gunepin, Florence Derache, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik, Mathieu Gunepin, Florence Derache, Jean-Eric Blatteau, Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik",2016 Feb,"Objective:
        
      
      Divers are vulnerable to barodontalgia (atmospheric pressure change related dental pain), which may jeopardize diving safety and mission completion. Our aim was to investigate the experience of barodontalgia among western military divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      French Armed Forces diving personnel were asked to answer a structured questionnaire including questions regarding their oral health, diving and career features, and barodontalgia while diving. For analysis, the participants were divided into commando/clearance divers (Group A) and ship divers (Group B).
    


          Results:
        
      
      All the requested 1389 divers agreed to participate in the study (100%) and 1317 divers (94.8%) who fully completed the questionnaire were included in the analysis. Of these 1317 individuals, 96 (7.3%) suffered from at least 1 episode of barodontalgia while diving, with a total of 119 episodes of barodontalgia. Barodontalgia was more frequent in the upper (62.2%) than the lower dentition (37.8%) (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) and appeared more common during descent (77.3%) than ascent (22.7%) (OR = 11.6; 95% CI, 6.3-31.3). Barodontalgia experience was higher in divers who have an examination less than once per year (14.5%) in comparison to divers who usually have a dental examination once a year or more (6.3%) (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Barodontalgia mostly appeared in the maxilla and during descent; therefore, a great role for barosinusitis in the etiology of oral pain while diving may be suggested. The infrequent experience of barodontalgia in divers who routinely visit the dentist once a year or more suggests that the risk of barodontalgia might decrease with the maintenance of a good oral status.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26802379/,2022-11-27 11:18:36 PM
Perspective on ultrasound bioeffects and possible implications for continuous post-dive monitoring safety,"Erica P McCune, David Q Le, Peter Lindholm, Kathryn R Nightingale, Paul A Dayton, Virginie Papadopoulou, Erica P McCune, David Q Le, Peter Lindholm, Kathryn R Nightingale, Paul A Dayton, Virginie Papadopoulou",2022 Jun 30,"Ultrasound monitoring, both in the form of Doppler and 2D echocardiography, has been used post-dive to detect decompression bubbles circulating in the bloodstream. With large variability in both bubble time course and loads, it has been hypothesised that shorter periods between imaging, or even continuous imaging, could provide more accurate post-dive assessments. However, while considering applications of ultrasound imaging post-decompression, it may also be prudent to consider the possibility of ultrasound-induced bioeffects. Clinical ultrasound studies using microbubble contrast agents have shown bioeffect generation with acoustic powers much lower than those used in post-dive monitoring. However, to date no studies have specifically investigated potential bioeffect generation from continuous post-dive echocardiography. This review discusses what can be drawn from the current ultrasound and diving literature on the safety of bubble sonication and highlights areas where more studies are needed. An overview of the ultrasound-bubble mechanisms that lead to bioeffects and analyses of ultrasound contrast agent studies on bioeffect generation in the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems are provided to illustrate how bubbles under ultrasound can cause damage within the body. Along with clinical ultrasound studies, studies investigating the effects of decompression bubbles under ultrasound are analysed and open questions regarding continuous post-dive monitoring safety are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732286/,2022-11-27 11:18:36 PM
Audit of waist measurement methods during statutory diving medical assessments,"N Williams, A Moore, M Woods, S Forman, N Williams, A Moore, M Woods, S Forman",2021 Aug 20,"Background:
        
      
      Measurement of waist circumference is used to assess abdominal fat and risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and stroke. It is performed in several clinical settings for health promotion and medical assessment purposes, including statutory medical assessments where results may influence decisions on fitness to work. Under the Diving at Work Regulations 1997, working divers must have an annual assessment of their fitness to dive performed by an approved medical examiner of divers (AMED), appointed by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The assessment includes measurement of height, weight and waist circumference, the latter used as an indicator of central adiposity and associated health risks.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To establish the practice of AMEDs in measuring waist circumference of working divers undergoing medical assessment to determine their fitness to dive.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ninety-seven AMEDs were sent a questionnaire and asked to describe their current practice in measuring waist circumference. The response rate was 79%. The audit standard used was the consensus document published by the World Health Organization (WHO).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 77 responses, 76 were completed sufficiently to allow analysis. When the waist was measured, there was consistency in the diver's level of clothing, stage of breathing and posture for the procedure but variability in the site of measurement. Only 7/76 (9%) respondents carried out waist measurement fully in line with WHO guidance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The audit has identified that there is a need for guidance for AMEDs on measuring waist circumference in the statutory medical assessment of working divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34415343/,2022-11-27 11:18:37 PM
Repeated hyperbaric exposure and glass ampoule safety,"Soon Yee Teoh, Venkat Narasimham Vangaveti, Soon Yee Teoh, Venkat Narasimham Vangaveti",2018 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      It has been our institution's policy to not place glass medication ampoules inside our hyperbaric chamber for fear of rupture. There is only a small and conflicting amount of data as to whether glass ampoules are safe for use under hyperbaric conditions.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The primary objective of this study was to test the safety and usability of glass medication ampoules inside a hyperbaric chamber.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Repetitive, rapidly staged compressions and decompressions were performed on multiple different glass medications ampoules inside the medical lock of a medical hyperbaric chamber. Medication ampoules of varying sizes (1 ml to 10 ml) of medication that may be required in a hyperbaric emergency were assessed. The ampoules were rapidly compressed 100 times to pressures of 142 kPa, 183 kPa, 300 kPa, 405 kPa and 507 kPa. They were then dropped from a height of 30 cm while compressed at 507 kPa and then half the ampoules were opened while pressurized at 507 kPa.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No ampoules were broken during compression or decompression. No ampoules broke when dropped from 30 cm onto the chamber floor. All ampoules opened at a pressure of 507 kPa functioned normally. No lids/ampoules shattered upon opening.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study suggests that glass medication ampoules appear to be safe for use inside a medical hyperbaric chamber at routine treatment pressures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888383/,2022-11-27 11:18:38 PM
Catastrophic neurologic injuries in sport,"Catherine S Wolff, Robert C Cantu, Kristen L Kucera, Catherine S Wolff, Robert C Cantu, Kristen L Kucera",2018,"Tens of millions of children and adults participate in organized sport in the United States each year. Although uncommon, fatal and severe nonfatal brain and spine injuries can occur during these activities. These ""catastrophic"" injuries have been noted in contact sports such as football, rugby, and ice hockey, as well as in noncontact sports including baseball, cheerleading, swimming and diving, equestrian, gymnastics, pole vault, rodeo, snow skiing, snowboarding, and wrestling. They happen at all levels of play, from youth to professional. Among all sports, football has the highest number of fatal brain and cervical spine injuries. While these injuries are more frequent in high school football, the rate is higher amongst college football athletes. Patterns exist in the types of brain and spine injuries most often occurring as a result of traumatic impacts in sport, but incidence and mechanisms of injury vary dramatically between sports. Understanding these patterns is essential to informing prevention efforts; football, pole vault, and cheer are all examples of sports benefiting from successful catastrophic injury prevention efforts. Participating in sport provides many benefits to physical and mental health. Despite these benefits, rare devastating injuries can be traumatic for the athletes, their families, and communities and can raise safety concerns that may reduce participation in sport. Understanding and preventing these types of injuries are critical to fostering participation in sport and ensuring both children and adults reap the physical, social, and mental benefits of sport.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482353/,2022-11-27 11:18:39 PM
"Fatalities involving divers using surface-supplied breathing apparatus in Australia, 1965 to 2019","John Lippmann, John Lippmann",2021 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study identified characteristics and diving practices of victims of fatal surface supplied breathing apparatus (SSBA) incidents in Australia from 1965-2019 to determine underlying factors and risks associated with these activities, better educate the diving community and prevent such deaths.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A hand search was made of 'Project Stickybeak' reports from 1965-2000 and SSBA fatality data were compared to the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation fatality database. The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify SSBA diving deaths for 2001-2019. Extracted data were collated and analysed using descriptive statistics and Poisson Regression. A chain of events analysis was used to determine the likely sequence of events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 84 identified SSBA-related deaths during the study period. Most victims were relatively young, healthy males (median age 33 years). At least 50% of victims were undertaking work-related diving, and 37% were recreational diving. Equipment issues, mainly compressor-related, were the main contributor, identified as a predisposing factor in 48% of incidents and as triggers in 24%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Preventable surface-supplied diving deaths still occur in both occupational and recreational diving, often from poor equipment maintenance and oversight. Incorrect configuration of the SSBA and lack of training remain on-going problems in recreational users. These could be addressed by improved education, and, failing this, regulatory oversight. The increase in health-related incidents in older participants may be controlled to some extent by greater medical oversight, especially in recreational and non-certified occupational divers who should be encouraged to undergo regular diving medical assessments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761541/,2022-11-27 11:18:39 PM
Decompression illness and other injuries in a recreational dive charter operation,"Marion Hubbard, F Michael Davis, Kate Malcolm, Scott J Mitchell, Marion Hubbard, F Michael Davis, Kate Malcolm, Scott J Mitchell",2018 Dec 24,"Introduction:
        
      
      Health and safety within the recreational diving industry are poorly described. We aimed to obtain the true prevalence of decompression illness (DCI) and other diving and non-diving injuries, including occupational injuries, in a large recreational diving charter operation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A New Zealand recreational diving operator keeps detailed records of diving activity and event/incident reports. We extracted passenger and crew numbers, dive numbers and incident statistics from all boat trips and associated work-related injuries between 01 January 2008 and 31 December 2014. The records of divers referred to the regional hyperbaric unit for suspected DCI were reviewed retrospectively. Using these data the prevalence of DCI and non-diving injuries were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 65,536 person-trips to sea and 57,072 divers undertook 97,144 dives. Fifty-five injury events were documented over seven years, 31 in customers and 24 in staff. Four divers (including one staff member) diagnosed with DCI underwent recompression therapy, giving a prevalence of 0.41 cases requiring recompression per 10,000 dives, or one case per 24,386 dives, whilst five other divers were assessed as not having DCI. There was one cardiac-related fatality. Thirty-five non-diving injuries (mainly lacerations and minor musculoskeletal injuries) were documented in 30 people resulting in 10 consulting a general practitioner and seven presenting to the local regional hospital emergency department.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      DCI requiring recompression was relatively rare in this supervised recreational diving operation. Minor non-diving injuries were the most common adverse event. Compared to other adventure sports, the prevalence of injury in recreational scuba diving is low.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517953/,2022-11-27 11:18:40 PM

      Some patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) might require repetitive hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) while receiving critical care. In such cases, the presence of a hyperbaric chamber located inside or near an ICU is preferable; however, this set-up is not always possible. In Padua, the ""Associazione Tecnici IPerbarici"" hyperbaric centre is a stand-alone facility outside of a hospital. Despite this, selected ICU patients receive HBOT at this facility.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed the medical records from 2003 to 2013 of 75 consecutive, critically-ill patients, 28 of whom were initially intubated and mechanically ventilated whilst undergoing HBOT. We evaluated the methods adopted in Padua to guarantee the safety and continuity of care during transfer for and during HBOT in this specially-equipped multiplace chamber.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 75 patients collectively received 315 HBOT sessions, 192 of which were with the patients intubated and mechanically ventilated. The diagnoses ranged from necrotizing fasciitis to post-surgical sepsis and intracranial abscess. We obtained full recovery for 73 patients. Two deaths were recorded not in close time relation to HBOT.

When adding other factors, such as dehydration, physical exercise and exposure to low temperature, it is likely that nitrogen desaturation after diving at such environmental conditions is far from optimal, There are only single reports on diving at high alti-tudes. In 2007 a Polish team of climbers and divers participated in the Tilicho Lake and Peak Expedition to the Himalaya Mountains in Nepal. During this expedition, four divers conducted six dives in the Tilicho Lake at altitude of 4,919 meters above mean sea level equivalent (16,138 feet) to a maximum depth of 15 meters of fresh water (mfw) (equivalent to 28 mfw at sea level by the Cross Correction method) and 30 mfw (equivalent to 57 mfw at sea level ""by Cross correction). Decompression debt was calculated using Cross Correction with some additional safety add-ons. Precordial Doppler recordings were taken every 15 minutes until 90 minutes after surfacing. No signs or symptoms of decompression sickness were observed after diving but in one diver, very high bubble grade Doppler signals were recorded. It can be concluded that diving at high altitude should be accompanied by additional safety precautions as well as taking into account personal sensitivity for such conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25562943/,2022-11-27 11:18:42 PM

      This study identified characteristics of victims of fatal scuba diving incidents to determine contributing factors and inform appropriate countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was searched to identify scuba diving deaths for 2001-2013, inclusive. Data were extracted from witness and police reports, medical histories and autopsies. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse these data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 scuba diving-related fatalities identified during the study period. The mean age was 44 years, 99 (79%) victims were male and 83 (77%) were either overweight or obese. Most deaths occurred in New South Wales and Queensland, often in a commercial setting. Twenty-three (79%) Queensland victims were overseas tourists. At least 52 (41%) were novices and 17 (13%) died during training or an introductory scuba experience. Only 35 (28%) were with a buddy when the incident occurred and at least 81 (64%) were still wearing weights when recovered.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The age of these victims may reflect an older cohort of participants and the associated higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions. The high prevalence of obesity suggests that this may be a risk factor. The high proportion of deaths in overseas tourists highlights an on-going need for appropriate screening and monitoring in what may be a higher risk cohort.

Barodontalgia Among Aircrew and Divers,"Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik, Idan Nakdimon, Yehuda Zadik",2019 Feb 1,"BACKGROUND: Barodontalgia, barometric pressure-induced dental pain, may jeopardize diving/flight safety. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the rate of barodontalgia among military and civilian divers and aircrews based on previous reports.METHODS: We analyzed the data of 4894 aircrew/divers reported in the literature. Barodontalgia rates (flight vs. diving, military vs. civilian, pressurized vs. non-pressurized aircrafts) were analyzed. The Chi-squared test was used to compare between groups.RESULTS: Of the 4894 individuals, 402 (8.2%) suffered from barodontalgia. Divers (9.8%) were more vulnerable than aircrews (5.8%). Barodontalgia experience rate was 5.4% and 6.5% in military and civilian aircrews, respectively, and 7.3% and 12.8% in military and civilian scuba divers, respectively. Barodontalgia was more common among aircrews of pressurized than non-pressurized aircrafts (7.3% vs. 3.2%, respectively).DISCUSSION: The greater amplitude of barometric pressure changes explains the higher rate of barodontalgia in divers than aircrew. The higher rate during pressurized flights is possibly because intracabin pressure in the pressurized cabin is still routinely higher than in nonpressurized aircrafts. Improved oral care and mandatory annual dental checkups may be the reason for the significantly lower rate of barodontalgia experienced among military aircrews and divers compared to their civilian counterparts. These results emphasize the essential role of atmospheric pressure change in the generation of pain during flight or diving and the importance of proper dental care.Nakdimon I, Zadik Y.

Decompression and decompression sickness,"Richard T Mahon, David P Regis, Richard T Mahon, David P Regis",2014 Jul,"The ever-present desire of humankind to explore new limits introduced us to the syndrome of decompression sickness (DCS).

The pathophysiology, current practices, role of bubble monitoring, risk factors, and potential long-term effects of DCS are also discussed. The goal is to explain the current state of DCS understanding in the context of a robust observational and empirical history. However, DCS remains a syndrome consisting of a constellation of symptoms following a change in ambient pressure. Though great strides have been made, significant knowledge gaps remain.

Field validation of Tasmania's aquaculture industry bounce-diving schedules using Doppler analysis of decompression stress,"David R Smart, Cory Van den Broek, Ron Nishi, P David Cooper, David Eastman, David R Smart, Cory Van den Broek, Ron Nishi, P David Cooper, David Eastman",2014 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      Tasmania's aquaculture industry produces over 40,000 tonnes of fish annually, valued at over AUD500M. Aquaculture divers perform repetitive, short-duration bounce dives in fish pens to depths up to 21 metres' sea water (msw). Past high levels of decompression illness (DCI) may have resulted from these 'yo-yo' dives. This study aimed to assess working divers, using Doppler ultrasonic bubble detection, to determine if yo-yo diving was a risk factor for DCI, determine dive profiles with acceptable risk and investigate productivity improvement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Field data were collected from working divers during bounce diving at marine farms near Hobart, Australia. Ascent rates were less than 18 m·min⁻¹, with routine safety stops (3 min at 3 msw) during the final ascent. The Kisman-Masurel method was used to grade bubbling post dive as a means of assessing decompression stress. In accordance with Defence Research and Development Canada Toronto practice, dives were rejected as excessive risk if more than 50% of scores were over Grade 2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 2002 to 2008, Doppler data were collected from 150 bounce-dive series (55 divers, 1,110 bounces). Three series of bounce profiles, characterized by in-water times, were validated: 13-15 msw, 10 bounces inside 75 min; 16-18 msw, six bounces inside 50 min; and 19-21 msw, four bounces inside 35 min. All had median bubble grades of 0. Further evaluation validated two successive series of bounces. Bubble grades were consistent with low-stress dive profiles. Bubble grades did not correlate with the number of bounces, but did correlate with ascent rate and in-water time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These data suggest bounce diving was not a major factor causing DCI in Tasmanian aquaculture divers. Analysis of field data has improved industry productivity by increasing the permissible number of bounces, compared to earlier empirically-derived tables, without compromising safety. The recommended Tasmanian Bounce Diving Tables provide guidance for bounce diving to a depth of 21 msw, and two successive bounce dive series in a day's diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25311318/,2022-11-27 11:18:46 PM

An in-water seizure is highly likely to be fatal. Recommendations for fitness to dive vary with some regarding epilepsy as an absolute contraindication to diving (South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society) and others permitting diving under strict criteria (United Kingdom Sport Diving Medical Committee) with diving to be postponed for a period of three to five years without seizures. Long-term follow up of people with epilepsy shows that at least one-third will have a recurrence and that the risk remains elevated for many years. We present three cases where individuals with a history of epilepsy (or likely epilepsy) almost fell through the cracks of health risk assessment, two with near-fatal consequences.

Hyperbaric intensive care technology and equipment,"Ian L Millar, Ian L Millar",2015 Mar,"In an emergency, life support can be provided during recompression or hyperbaric oxygen therapy using very basic equipment, provided the equipment is hyperbaric-compatible and the clinicians have appropriate experience. For hyperbaric critical care to be provided safely on a routine basis, however, a great deal of preparation and specific equipment is needed, and relatively few facilities have optimal capabilities at present. The type, size and location of the chamber are very influential factors. Although monoplace chamber critical care is possible, it involves special adaptations and inherent limitations that make it inappropriate for all but specifically experienced teams. A large, purpose-designed chamber co-located with an intensive care unit is ideal. Keeping the critically ill patient on their normal bed significantly improves quality of care where this is possible. The latest hyperbaric ventilators have resolved many of the issues normally associated with hyperbaric ventilation, but at significant cost. Multi-parameter monitoring is relatively simple with advanced portable monitors, or preferably installed units that are of the same type as used elsewhere in the hospital. Whilst end-tidal CO₂ readings are changed by pressure and require interpretation, most other parameters display normally. All normal infusions can be continued, with several examples of syringe drivers and infusion pumps shown to function essentially normally at pressure. Techniques exist for continuous suction drainage and most other aspects of standard critical care. At present, the most complex life support technologies such as haemofiltration, cardiac assist devices and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation remain incompatible with the hyperbaric environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964040/,2022-11-27 11:18:48 PM
Effects of Hyperbaric Nitrogen Narcosis on Cognitive Performance in Recreational air SCUBA Divers: An Auditory Event-related Brain Potentials Study,"Huseyin Karakaya, Serkan Aksu, Salih Murat Egi, Salih Aydin, Atilla Uslu, Huseyin Karakaya, Serkan Aksu, Salih Murat Egi, Salih Aydin, Atilla Uslu",2021 Jun 12,"Background:
        
      
      The narcotic effect of hyperbaric nitrogen is most pronounced in air-breathing divers because it impairs diver's cognitive and behavioral performance, and limits the depth of dive profiles. We aimed to investigate the cognitive effects of simulated (500 kPa) air environments in recreational SCUBA divers, revealed by auditory event-related potentials (AERPs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 18 healthy volunteer recreational air SCUBA divers participated in the study. AERPs were recorded in pre-dive, deep-dive, and post-dive sessions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      False-positive score variables were found with significantly higher differences and longer reaction times of hits during deep-dive and post-dive than pre-dive sessions. Also, P3 amplitudes were significantly reduced and peak latencies were prolonged during both deep-dive and post-dive compared with pre-dive sessions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We observed that nitrogen narcosis at 500 kPa pressure in the dry hyperbaric chamber has a mild-to-moderate negative effect on the cognitive performance of recreational air SCUBA divers, which threatened the safety of diving. Although relatively decreased, this effect also continued in the post-dive sessions. These negative effects are especially important for divers engaged in open-sea diving. Our results show crucial implications for the kinds of control measures that can help to prevent nitrogen narcosis and diving accidents at depths up to 40 msw.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33942846/,2022-11-27 11:18:48 PM

Gas embolism and decompression-like sickness have also been described in wild animals, such as cetaceans. It was hypothesized that adaptations to the marine environment protected them from DCS, but in 2003, decompression-like sickness was described for the first time in beaked whales, challenging this dogma. Since then, several episodes of mass strandings of beaked whales coincidental in time and space with naval maneuvers have been recorded and diagnosed with DCS. The diagnosis of human DCS is based on the presence of clinical symptoms and the detection of gas embolism by ultrasound, but in cetaceans, the diagnosis is limited to forensic investigations. For this reason, it is necessary to resort to experimental animal models to support the pathological diagnosis of DCS in cetaceans. The objective of this study is to validate the pathological results of cetaceans through an experimental rabbit model wherein a complete and detailed histopathological analysis was performed. Gross and histopathological results were very similar in the experimental animal model compared to stranded cetaceans with DCS, with the presence of gas embolism systemically distributed as well as emphysema and hemorrhages as primary lesions in different organs. The experimental data reinforces the pathological findings found in cetaceans with DCS as well as the hypothesis that individuality plays an essential role in DCS, as it has previously been proposed in animal models and human diving medicine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34169109/,2022-11-27 11:18:49 PM
Underwater blast injury: a review of standards,"Rachel M Lance, Cameron R Bass, Rachel M Lance, Cameron R Bass",2015 Sep,"The first cases of underwater blast injury appeared in the scientific literature in 1917, and thousands of service members and civilians were injured or killed by underwater blast during WWII. The prevalence of underwater blast injuries and occupational blasting needs led to the development of many safety standards to prevent injury or death. Most of these standards were not supported by experimental data or testing. In this review, we describe existing standards, discuss their origins, and we comprehensively compare their prescriptions across standards. Surprisingly, we found that most safety standards had little or no scientific basis, and prescriptions across standards often varied by at least an order of magnitude. Many published standards traced back to a US Navy 500 psi guideline, which was intended to provide a peak pressure at which injuries were likely to occur. This standard itself seems to have been based upon a completely unfounded assertion that has propagated throughout the literature in subsequent years. Based on the limitations of the standards discussed, we outline future directions for underwater blast injury research, such as the compilation of epidemiological data to examine actual injury risk by human beings subjected to underwater blasts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415071/,2022-11-27 11:18:50 PM

Various treatments are reported in the literature; however, results are not always promising and amputations may be required for some patients. Post-natal hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may be a useful treatment option for the salvage of affected limbs. A patient who was born with total brachial artery occlusion and severe limb ischaemia was referred for HBOT. The patient underwent the first HBOT session at her 48th hour of life. A total of 47 HBOT sessions were completed (243.1 kPa [2.4 atmospheres absolute], duration 115 minutes being: 15 minutes of compression; three 25-minute oxygen periods separated by five-minute air breaks; and 15 minutes of decompression), four in the first 24 hours. Full recovery was achieved with this intense HBOT schedule combined with anticoagulation, fasciotomy and supportive care. The new-born tolerated HBOT well and no complications or side effects occurred.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring Diving and Diabetes: An Update of the Swedish Recommendations,"Johan Jendle, Peter Adolfsson, Johan Jendle, Peter Adolfsson",2020 Jan,"Divers travel to different countries to explore various diving sites worldwide. In 2005, the Divers Alert Network (DAN) published their guidelines for recreational diving and diabetes mellitus. However, although years have passed, there is still no consensus in the form of international guidelines on diabetes and diving. Large differences are noted with regard to the regulations in different countries. Furthermore, the diabetes technology has evolved rapidly and is not reflected in current international guidelines. This is potentially both a medical and an insurance problem for a diver with diabetes. We present a short summary of the recently updated Swedish recommendations for recreational divers with type 1 diabetes mellitus, focusing on the use of continuous glucose monitoring and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion during such circumstances.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712367/,2022-11-27 11:18:53 PM
Proof-of-concept for a segmented composite diving suit offering depth-independent thermal protection,"Aaron Demers, Shane Martin, Emil P Kartalov, Aaron Demers, Shane Martin, Emil P Kartalov",2021 Sep 30,"Heat loss is a major health hazard for divers. It can lead to hypothermia, organ damage, unconsciousness, and eventually death. Hence, thermal protection is essential for diver safety. Typically, protection is provided by wetsuits made of bubbled neoprene. However, neoprene shrinks with depth and loses thermal insulation capability, while thick neoprene suits make swimming exhausting. Herein, a proof-of-concept is presented for a solution to both problems: a 'K-suit' made of thermally-resistive composite segments attached to a thin neoprene suit. The segments are made of hollow glass microspheres embedded in carrier polymer thermally cured in 3D-printed molds based on 3D-scans of the diver's body. The K-suit was compared in field trials with a 7 mm commercial neoprene suit by diving in pairs, while automated dataloggers registered pressure and temperature inside and outside both suits. The K-suit demonstrated +4ºC higher temperature difference than the 7 mm neoprene. Also, divers reported that the K-suit had the ergonomics of a 3 mm neoprene suit. These preliminary results represent a proof-of-concept for the K-suit and promise further improvements with potential impact on diver safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547781/,2022-11-27 11:18:54 PM
Diving into 3D (bio)printing: A revolutionary tool to customize the production of drug and cell-based systems for skin delivery,"Sara Bom, Ana M Martins, Helena M Ribeiro, Joana Marto, Sara Bom, Ana M Martins, Helena M Ribeiro, Joana Marto",2021 Aug 10,"The incorporation of 3D printing technologies in the pharmaceutical industry can revolutionize its R&D, by providing a simple and rapid method to produce tailored one-off batches, each with customized dosages, different compounds, shapes, sizes, and adjusted release rates. Particularly, this type of technology can be advantageous for the development of topical and transdermal drug delivery systems, including patches and microneedles. The use of both systems as drug carriers offers advantages over the oral administration, but the possibility of skin irritation and sensitization, and the high production costs, may hinder the expansion of this market. In this context, 3D printing, a high-resolution technique, allows the design of high quality, personalized, complex and sophisticated structures, thus reducing the production costs and improving the patient compliance. This review covers the 3D printing concept and discusses the relevance of this technology to the pharmaceutical industry, with a special focus on the development of topical and transdermal products - patches and microneedles. The potential of 3D bioprinting for skin applications is also presented, highlighting the development of patch-like skin constructs for wound and burn treatment, and skin equivalents for in vitro research and drug development.

Altered Venous Blood Nitric Oxide Levels at Depth and Related Bubble Formation During Scuba Diving,"Danilo Cialoni, Andrea Brizzolari, Michele Samaja, Massimo Pieri, Alessandro Marroni, Danilo Cialoni, Andrea Brizzolari, Michele Samaja, Massimo Pieri, Alessandro Marroni",2019 Feb 21,"Introduction: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of diving, and the related endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress roles have been extensively investigated. However, most available data have been obtained before and after the dive, whilst, as far as we know, no data is available about what happens during the water immersion phase of dive. The scope of this study is to investigate the Nitrate and Nitrite (NOX) concentration and the total plasma antioxidant capacity (TAC) before, during and after a single SCUBA dive in healthy scuba diving volunteers, as well as to look for evidence of a possible relationship with venous gas bubble formation. Materials and Methods: Plasma, obtained from blood of 15 expert SCUBA divers, 13 male and 2 female, was investigated for differences in NOX and TAC values in different dive times. Differences in NOX and TAC values in subjects previously known as ""bubble resistant"" (non-bubblers - NB) and ""bubble prone"" (Bubblers - B) were investigated. Results: We found a statistically significant increase of NOX plasma concentration in the ""bottom blood draw"" and in the ""safety stop blood draw"" as compared to the basal pre diving condition. We did not find any difference in NOX plasma concentration between the basal value and the post diving samples. We did not find any significant statistical difference in TAC in the bottom blood sample, while the safety-stop and the post-dive samples showed higher TAC values compared with the basal value. We did not find any difference in NOX and TAC mean values between non-bubblers and Bubblers. Discussion: Our protocol, by including underwater blood drawing, allowed to monitor plasma NOX changes occurred during diving activity, and not only by comparing pre and post diving values. It is particularly interesting to note that the increased NOX values found at the bottom and at the safety stop were not observed at post dive sampling (T0, T30, T60), showing a very rapid return to the pre-dive values. In this preliminary study we did not find any relationship between bubble formation and changes in NOX parameters and TAC response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30846941/,2022-11-27 11:18:55 PM
Orofacial problems in scuba diving: prevalence and prevention-a large-scale survey among civilian divers in France,"Paul-Alexandre Moyaux, Gabriel Fernandez de Grado, Anne-Marie Musset, Damien Offner, Paul-Alexandre Moyaux, Gabriel Fernandez de Grado, Anne-Marie Musset, Damien Offner",2022 Oct,"Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving is becoming widely democratized among hobbyist practitioners. It can cause orofacial problems, mostly linked to pressure changes. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of these problems and to analyze civilian divers' behavior about their dental prevention in France, via a cross-sectional study. Data from 1015 French civilian divers were collected via a nationwide online questionnaire in which participants indicated information concerning orofacial experienced problems during their diving activity, and their medical preventive habits. As results, oral manifestations were experienced by 25.2% of the divers, including barodontalgia (10.8%), mouth syndrome (13.4%), gum pain (2.8%) and dental fractures caused by barotrauma (3.7%) or shocks (1.9%). Mouth syndrome was more frequent among women (18.6%) and divers aged between 18 and 34 years (18.9%). The prevalence of dental fractures increased significantly with age. High diving level was associated with more frequent barodontalgia (17.5%), gum pain (7%) and barotrauma (7.6%). Among respondents, 43.5% completed a dental examination before a diving season and showed fewer oral problems during their scuba diving practice than those who did not. In conclusion, oral problems in scuba diving represent frequent events that can compromise the safety of divers. Despite awareness rising, there is a lack of recourse to the dentist. This leads to incomplete information, especially concerning the preventive means available to divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35637398/,2022-11-27 11:18:56 PM

To scale down risks, medical examinations are mandatory and overwhelmingly performed using bicycle ergometry, which overlooks some important aspects of diving. Searching ergometric systems that better address the underwater environment, a systematic literature search was conducted using the keywords 'diving', 'fitness', 'ergometry', and 'exertion'. All presented alternative systems found convincingly describe a greatly reduced underwater physical performance. Thus, if a diver's workload in air should already be limited, he/she will suffer early from fatigue, risking a diving incident. How to assess fitness? Performance diagnostics in sports is always specific for a modality or movement. Therefore, professional scuba divers should be tested when fin-swimming underwater. For the vast number of recreational divers, the current screening can likely not be replaced. However, to prevent accidents, divers need to understand and be able to improve factors that limit their physical performance underwater.

How to Survive 33 min after the Umbilical of a Saturation Diver Severed at a Depth of 90 msw?,"Sven Dreyer, Andreas Deussen, Dietmar Berndt, Jochen D Schipke, Sven Dreyer, Andreas Deussen, Dietmar Berndt, Jochen D Schipke",2022 Feb 28,"In 2012, a severe accident happened during the mission of a professional saturation diver working at a depth of 90 m in the North Sea. The dynamic positioning system of the diver support vessel crashed, and the ship drifted away from the working place, while one diver's umbilical became snagged on a steel platform and was severed. After 33 min, he was rescued into the diving bell, without exhibiting any obvious neurological injury. In 2019, the media and a later 'documentary' film suggested that a miracle had happened to permit survival of the diver once his breathing gas supply was limited to only 5 min. Based on the existing data and phone calls with the diver concerned (Dc), the present case report tries to reconstruct, on rational grounds, how Dc could have survived after he was cut off from breathing gas, hot water, light and communication while 90 m deep at the bottom of the sea. Dc carried bail-out heliox (86/14) within two bottles (2 × 12 L × 300 bar: 7200 L). Calculating Dc's varying per-minute breathing gas consumption over time, both the decreased viscosity of the helium mix and the pressure-related increase in viscosity did not exhibit a breathing gas gap. Based on the considerable respiratory heat loss, the core temperature was calculated to be as low as 28.8 °C to 27.2 °C after recovery in the diving bell. In accordance with the literature, such values would be associated with impaired or lost consciousness, respectively. Relocating Dc on the drilling template by using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the transport of the victim to the bell and subsequent care in the hyperbaric chamber must be regarded as exemplary. We conclude that, based on rational arguments and available literature data, Dc's healthy survival is not a miracle, as it can be convincingly explained by means of reliable data. Remaining with a breathing gas supply sufficient for five minutes only would not have ended in a miracle but would have ended in death by suffocation. Nevertheless, survival of such an accident may appear surprising, and probably the limit for a healthy outcome was very close. We conclude, in addition, that highly effective occupational safety measures, in particular the considerable bail-out heliox reserve, secured the healthy survival. Nevertheless, the victim's survival is likely to be due to his excellent diving training, together with many years of diving routine. The rescue action of the second diver and Dc's retrieval by the ROV operator are also suggestive of the behavior of carefully selected crew members with the high degree of professional qualification needed to correctly function in a hostile environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35326931/,2022-11-27 11:18:58 PM
"A scuba diving direct sediment sampling methodology on benthic transects in glacial lakes: procedure description, safety measures, and tests results","Alfonso Pardo, Alfonso Pardo",2014 Nov,"This work presents an in situ sediment sampling method on benthic transects, specifically intended for scientific scuba diver teams. It was originally designed and developed to sample benthic surface and subsurface sediments and subaqueous soils in glacial lakes up to a maximum depth of 25 m. Tests were conducted on the Sabocos and Baños tarns (i.e., cirque glacial lakes) in the Spanish Pyrenees. Two 100 m transects, ranging from 24.5 to 0 m of depth in Sabocos and 14 m to 0 m deep in Baños, were conducted. In each test, 10 sediment samples of 1 kg each were successfully collected and transported to the surface. This sampling method proved operative even in low visibility conditions (<2 m). Additional ice diving sampling tests were conducted in Sabocos and Truchas tarns. This sampling methodology can be easily adapted to accomplish underwater sampling campaigns in nonglacial lakes and other continental water or marine environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24943883/,2022-11-27 11:18:58 PM

Results indicated that pH, EC, total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) were increased and total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were decreased during the composting of industrial sludge with biochar compared with the control (sludge without biochar). The addition of earthworm to the biochar-amended sludge further decreased pH and TOC but highly enhanced the EC, TN, TP and TK. Comparatively lower concentrations of total and DTPA-extractable heavy metals were observed in biochar-amended sludge treatments mixed with earthworm in comparison with the biochar-amended sludge treatments without earthworm or the control. Sequential extraction methods demonstrated that vermicomposting of sludge with biochar converted more metals bound with exchangeable, carbonate and organic matter into the residual fraction in comparison with those composting treatments of sludge with biochar. As a result, the combination of rice husk biochar and earthworm accelerated the passivation of heavy metals in industrial sludge during vermicomposting. Rice husk biochar and earthworm can play a positive role in sequestering the metals during the treatment of industrial sludge.

Transient Unilateral Facial Nerve Baroparesis with Vertigo on Ascent in the F-16CM,"Matthew S Wimmer, Talib Y Ali, Matthew S Wimmer, Talib Y Ali",2016 Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Presented is a rare case of transient unilateral facial nerve paralysis occurring in a pilot while on initial ascent in an F-16CM. This pathology is sporadically observed in the diving community, but rarely described in military or civil aviation. This case was particularly unusual in its promptness of onset, rapid recovery, and its association with vertigo.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      This case report describes a previously healthy 26-yr-old F-16 pilot who experienced ear block and subsequent unilateral facial paralysis while on initial ascent. This was relieved quickly after clearing the affected ear without any neurological sequelae. A second episode was associated with vertigo in addition to the ear block and facial symptoms. Both episodes were separated by 3 d.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Barotrauma to the facial nerve via an uncovered or ""dehiscent"" facial nerve canal was suggested by the clinical course, computed tomography, and confirmed by expert consultation. Making the diagnosis in an aviator, especially the military aviator, is important for safety of flight, to avoid unwarranted diagnostics, and to minimize operational impact.

      The treatment of divers for decompression illness (DCI) in Auckland, New Zealand, has not been described since 1996, and subsequent trends in patient numbers and demographics are unmeasured.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective audit of DCI cases requiring recompression in Auckland between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2012. Data describing patient demographics, dive characteristics, presentation of DCI and outcomes were extracted from case notes and facility databases. Trends in annual case numbers were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficients (ρ) and compared with trends in entry-level diver certifications. Trends in patient demographics and delay between diving and recompression were evaluated using regression analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 520 DCI cases. Annual caseload decreased over the study period (ρ = 0.813, P < 0.0001) as did entry level diving certifications in New Zealand (ρ = 0.962, P < 0.0001). Mean diver age was 33.6 (95% confidence limits (CI) 32.7 to 34.5) years and age increased (P < 0.0001) over the study period. Median (range) delay to recompression was 2.06 (95% CI 0.02 to 23.6) days, and delay declined over the study period (P = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Numbers of DCI cases recompressed in Auckland have declined significantly over the last 17 years.

      Softball is a popular participant sport in the United States. This study investigated the epidemiology of softball injuries with comparisons between children and adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for patients 7 years and older treated in an emergency department (ED) for a softball injury from 1994 through 2010 were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An estimated 2107823 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1736417-2479229) patients were treated in US EDs for a softball injury during the 17-year study period. The annual number of injuries decreased by 23.0% from 1994 to 2010 (P < .001); however, during the last 6 years of the study, injuries increased by 11.7% (P = .008). The annual rate of softball injuries increased significantly during the study period (P = .035). The most commonly injured body regions were the hand/wrist (22.2%) and face (19.3%). Being hit by a ball was the most common mechanism of injury (52.4%) and accounted for most of face (89.6%) and head (75.7%) injuries. Injuries associated with running (relative risk, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.97-2.82) and diving for a ball (relative risk, 4.61; 95% CI, 3.50-6.09) were more likely to occur among adult than pediatric patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate softball injuries using a nationally representative sample. Softball is a common source of injury among children and adults.

Decreased Incidence of Pulmonary Barotrauma After Discontinuation of Emergency Free Ascent Training,"Pierre Lafère, Peter Germonpré, François Guerrero, Alessandro Marroni, Costantino Balestra, Pierre Lafère, Peter Germonpré, François Guerrero, Alessandro Marroni, Costantino Balestra",2018 Sep 1,"Introduction:
        
      
      Because a significant association between training to perform emergency free ascent (EFA) and the occurrence of pulmonary barotrauma (PBT) was demonstrated in 2006, the Belgian Underwater Federation (BUF) decided to discontinue this procedure. An evaluation was needed 10 yr after the implementation of this change.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All medical records with a diagnosis of PBT that occurred in Belgium from November 2006 to September 2016 were prospectively collected. Data on the proportion of in-water skills training dives were obtained from BUF.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 5 cases of PBT were identified, significantly down from 34 cases in the previous 10-yr period. Of those cases, four occurred during training dives (two during ascent training). Analysis of the case files furthermore showed that two should have been medically disqualified from diving. Compared with the retrospective cohort (1995-2005), incidences are significantly reduced from 0.83 to 0.078/10,000 training dives and from 3.33 to 0.11/10,000 ascent-training dives; concomitantly, the incidence of PBT in nontraining dives also was reduced (from 0.0042 to 0.0014×10-4/10,000 dives), possibly because less divers undertake the EFA procedure in case of a technical incident and have learned to solve the problem differently.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Discontinuation of emergency free ascent training was associated with a reduction in the incidence of PBT in the 10-yr follow-up period. We observed a significant decrease of PBT during training dives, confirming the hypothesis that EFA training in its previous form did not contribute significantly to diving safety.Lafère P, Germonpré P, Guerrero F, Marroni A, Balestra C.

User settings on dive computers: reliability in aiding conservative diving,"Martin D J Sayer, Elaine Azzopardi, Arne Sieber, Martin D J Sayer, Elaine Azzopardi, Arne Sieber",2016 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Divers can make adjustments to diving computers when they may need or want to dive more conservatively (e.g., diving with a persistent (patent) foramen ovale). Information describing the effects of these alterations or how they compare to other methods, such as using enriched air nitrox (EANx) with air dive planning tools, is lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seven models of dive computer from four manufacturers (Mares, Suunto, Oceanic and UWATEC) were subjected to single square-wave compression profiles (maximum depth: 20 or 40 metres' sea water, msw), single multi-level profiles (maximum depth: 30 msw; stops at 15 and 6 msw), and multi-dive series (two dives to 30 msw followed by one to 20 msw). Adjustable settings were employed for each dive profile; some modified profiles were compared against stand-alone use of EANx.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Dives were shorter or indicated longer decompression obligations when conservative settings were applied. However, some computers in default settings produced more conservative dives than others that had been modified. Some computer-generated penalties were greater than when using EANx alone, particularly at partial pressures of oxygen (PO₂) below 1.40 bar. Some computers 'locked out' during the multi-dive series; others would continue to support decompression with, in some cases, automatically-reduced levels of conservatism. Changing reduced gradient bubble model values on Suunto computers produced few differences.
    


          Discussion:

Enriched Air Nitrox Breathing Reduces Venous Gas Bubbles after Simulated SCUBA Diving: A Double-Blind Cross-Over Randomized Trial,"Vincent Souday, Nick J Koning, Bruno Perez, Fabien Grelon, Alain Mercat, Christa Boer, Valérie Seegers, Peter Radermacher, Pierre Asfar, Vincent Souday, Nick J Koning, Bruno Perez, Fabien Grelon, Alain Mercat, Christa Boer, Valérie Seegers, Peter Radermacher, Pierre Asfar",2016 May 10,"Objective:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis whether enriched air nitrox (EAN) breathing during simulated diving reduces decompression stress when compared to compressed air breathing as assessed by intravascular bubble formation after decompression.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Human volunteers underwent a first simulated dive breathing compressed air to include subjects prone to post-decompression venous gas bubbling. Twelve subjects prone to bubbling underwent a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial including one simulated dive breathing compressed air, and one dive breathing EAN (36% O2) in a hyperbaric chamber, with identical diving profiles (28 msw for 55 minutes). Intravascular bubble formation was assessed after decompression using pulmonary artery pulsed Doppler.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve subjects showing high bubble production were included for the cross-over trial, and all completed the experimental protocol. In the randomized protocol, EAN significantly reduced the bubble score at all time points (cumulative bubble scores: 1 [0-3.5] vs. 8 [4.5-10]; P < 0.001). Three decompression incidents, all presenting as cutaneous itching, occurred in the air versus zero in the EAN group (P = 0.217). Weak correlations were observed between bubble scores and age or body mass index, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      EAN breathing markedly reduces venous gas bubble emboli after decompression in volunteers selected for susceptibility for intravascular bubble formation. When using similar diving profiles and avoiding oxygen toxicity limits, EAN increases safety of diving as compared to compressed air breathing.

Problems and solutions of stent biofilm and encrustations: A review of literature,"Sara Khoddami, Ben H Chew, Dirk Lange, Sara Khoddami, Ben H Chew, Dirk Lange",2020 Nov,"A ureteral stent is a commonly implanted urological device in patients with urinary tract obstruction. The main role of these stents is to allow adequate drainage of urine from the kidney into the bladder. Individuals with strictures, tumors, or obstructions from urinary stones do not have adequate urine flow and require ureteral stents as a part of their treatment to avoid potential hydronephrosis and renal failure. Although ureteral stents are highly effective in treating urinary tract obstructions, they have associated morbidities, such as biofilm formation and encrustation. Researchers have studied about how to diminish these negative outcomes by developing novel stent materials. Different coatings and biomaterials have been developed to reduce bacterial adhesion and crystal deposition onto the stent surfaces. Moreover, new investigation technologies, such as microfluidic platforms and encrustation sensors, have been utilized to better study the stents. Biofilms and encrustations can stem from bacterial origins; therefore, understanding the urinary microbiome will also provide insight into the solutions for treating them. There are still some gaps in our knowledge regarding the exact underlying mechanisms of stent-associated biofilms and encrustation. Future studies should include continuous testing of novel stent biomaterials for safety and efficacy, developing new technologies for identifying and extracting biofilms, enriching the assessment of stent encrustation, and diving deeper into understanding the urinary microbiome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33052843/,2022-11-27 11:19:07 PM
Fatal air embolism in a breath-hold diver,"Neil Dg Banham, John Lippmann, Neil Dg Banham, John Lippmann",2019 Dec 20,"Cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) from breath-holding or inadequate exhalation during ascent is a well-recognised complication of scuba diving. It does not usually occur with breath-hold (BH) diving in those with normal lungs, as the volume of gas in the lungs on surfacing cannot exceed what it was on leaving the surface. However, a BH diver who breathes from a compressed gas supply at depth essentially becomes a scuba diver and is at risk of pulmonary barotrauma (PBt) and CAGE on ascent. In this case, a 26-year-old male experienced BH diver breathed from a scuba set at approximately 10 metres' sea water depth and ascended, sustaining massive PBt and CAGE with a fatal outcome. BH and scuba divers, especially those with less experience, need to be well-informed about this potential risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31828750/,2022-11-27 11:19:08 PM
Fumigation on bulk cargo ships: a chemical threat to seafarers,"Rune Djurhuus, Rune Djurhuus",2021,"Fumigation is a process that is carried out to prevent deterioration of goods by pests and spread of unwanted organisms for example during long-distance carriage by sea. Several intoxications due to use of pesticides on bulk cargo ships have been indicated, but for some of these incidents the documentation are questionable. The objective of the present study was therefore to examine the extent of the problem by collecting available information of incidents or intoxications due to use of pesticides on bulk cargo ships. Information sources such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Gard (marine insurance company), Marine Accident Investigation Branch, United Kingdom, and Professional Mariner (a magazine) were searched using similar search phrases. The results indicate that the present practice of fumigation with pesticides of cargo holds on bulk ships represents a serious health risk to both seafarers and port workers. A thorough search for information in both scientific and non-scientific sources revealed a number of intoxications including several fatalities. According to the available documentation, phosphine seems to be used more or less exclusively as fumigant on bulk cargo ships today. Phosphine has a high acute toxicity, and recent findings suggest long-term effects. Several of the reported incidents point to lack of knowledge and neglecting of recommended procedures as key elements in this respect. The problem is likely underestimated due to lack of available documentation of several incidents. Preventive actions should be implemented that focus on documentation of incidents, increase knowledge of pesticide health hazard and implementation of safety procedures that are mandatory to perform when fumigated cargo is to be handled on bulk ships.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34604991/,2022-11-27 11:19:09 PM
Saturation diver fatality due to hydrogen sulphide while working on a subsea pipe line,"Ajit C Kulkarni, Ajit C Kulkarni",2021 Mar 31,"In the offshore oil industry, Multipurpose Support Vessels with extensive diving capability are used for inspection, maintenance and repair of subsea pipelines. The diving industry has developed systemic safety checks and strict regulatory control after a number of fatal accidents in early years. However, accidents do continue to occur and, when involving divers in the water, are often fatal. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S), called 'sour gas' in an oil field, is produced by the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulphate containing organic matter. A highly toxic gas, it remains a constant danger for offshore oil industry workers who must remain vigilant. Crude oil and gas produced in these oilfields is called 'sour crude' and pipelines carry this crude with varying content of dissolved H2S to shore for processing. Divers are routinely called to attend to leaking pipelines and come in contact with this crude. Their hot water suits and umbilical lines are often covered with crude containing dissolved H2S. There is always a possibility that these may enter and contaminate the bell environment.

Oxygen toxicity seizures during United States Navy Treatment Table 6: An acceptable risk in monoplace chambers?,"Samantha Bonnington, Neil Banham, Kevin Foley, Ian Gawthrope, Samantha Bonnington, Neil Banham, Kevin Foley, Ian Gawthrope",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may be complicated by oxygen toxicity seizures, which typically occur with hyperbaric partial pressures of oxygen exceeding 203 kPa (2 atmospheres absolute). All other hyperbaric units in Australia exclusively use a multiplace chamber when treating with United States Navy Treatment Table 6 (USN TT6) due to this perceived risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of a monoplace chamber when treating decompression illness (DCI) with USN TT6.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients treated at Fiona Stanley Hospital Hyperbaric Medicine Unit with USN TT6 between November 2014 and June 2020 was undertaken. These data were combined with previous results from studies performed at our hyperbaric unit at Fremantle Hospital from 1989 to 2014, creating a data set covering a 30-year period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One thousand treatments with USN TT6 were performed between 1989 and 2020; 331 in a monoplace chamber and 669 in a multiplace chamber. Four seizures occurred: a rate of 0.59% (1/167) in a multiplace chamber; and none in a monoplace chamber, indicating no statistically significant difference between seizures in a monoplace versus multiplace chamber (P = 0.31).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The rate of oxygen toxicity seizures in a monoplace chamber is not significantly higher than for treatment in the multiplace chamber. We conclude that using the monoplace chamber for USN TT6 in selected patients poses an acceptably low seizure risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157732/,2022-11-27 11:19:10 PM
"Mortality rate during professionally guided scuba diving experiences for uncertified divers, 1992-2019","Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Karl Shreeves",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to re-examine the mortality rate among participants in the Professional Association of Diving Instructors' (PADI)'s Discover Scuba Diving (DSD) programme.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fatalities reported to PADI as having occurred during DSD scuba dives were counted for each year between 1992 and 2019. DSD participant registrations were also counted for each year. The data were conveniently divided into two equal 14-year periods, 1992-2005 ('early') and 2006-2019 ('late'). To smooth out the year-to-year variation in raw rates, Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the mean rate per 100,000 participants per year during each period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were a total of 7,118,731 DSD participant registrations and 79 fatalities during the study period. The estimated overall mean mortality rate in the early period was 2.55 per 100,000 DSD registrations whereas the estimated rate of 0.87 per 100,000 DSD registrations was significantly lower in the late period (P < 0.0001).

      PADI's contemporary Discover Scuba Diving introductory scuba experiences, at 0.87 fatalities per 100,000 participants, have a calculated mortality rate that is less than half that calculated for 1992-2008.

      This study reviews diving deaths that occurred in Tasmanian waters over a 20-year period.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Detailed analysis was undertaken of deaths that occurred from 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2014. The cases were collated from numerous sources. Utilising a chain of events analysis, factors were identified and assigned to predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and cause of death. These were then scrutinised to ascertain regional variables, remediable factors and linkages which may benefit from targeted risk mitigation strategies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventeen deaths were identified across this 20-year period, which included one additional case not previously recorded. All were recreational divers and 15 were male. Five were hookah divers, 12 were scuba divers. Important predisposing factors identified included equipment (condition and maintenance), pre-existing health conditions, diver experience and training. These factors can now be used to promote public health messages for divers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This 20-year study highlighted regional variations for Tasmanian deaths and presents opportunities for strategies to prevent diving deaths in the future. Of particular concern was the diving practice of 'hookah' diving, which has no governing regulations.

The impact of repetitive hyperbaric exposure during SCUBA diving on cochlear implants,"Justin M Hintze, Lina Geyer, Conall W Fitzgerald, Cristina Simoes Franklin, Fergal Glynn, Laura Viani, Peter Walshe, Justin M Hintze, Lina Geyer, Conall W Fitzgerald, Cristina Simoes Franklin, Fergal Glynn, Laura Viani, Peter Walshe",2019 Dec,"Objectives/hypothesis:
        
      
      Complications during or after cochlear implantation are relatively rare. They occur more frequently in patients who partake in activities that can potentially lead to local trauma. No formal recommendations exist for participation in self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) activities. We describe three patients with a combined five cochlear implants and extensive diving experience, the largest case series to date, and highlight some of the difficulties faced. We also review the literature on previously described SCUBA-diving patients with cochlear implants.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Retrospective case series and literature review.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review of the known SCUBA divers in the National Hearing Implant and Research Centre in Ireland was conducted, and a review of the literature was carried out using PubMed and Google Scholar.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the three SCUBA divers with cochlear implants, two required reimplantation, the first due to nonauditory stimulation, and the second due to extrusion of the electrode through the tympanic membrane following repetitive SCUBA dives. The third patient remains without complications after 80 dives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with cochlear implants can have complications relating to the implant itself, with device failure a theoretical risk. The cochleostomy can lead to perilymphatic extravasation, as well as inner ear barotrauma, decompression sickness, and formation of air bubbles along the electrode. A combination of deafness, vestibulopathy with abrupt perilymph leak, and loss of proprioception can lead to disorientation and blue dome syndrome. Based on our experience with cochlear implants in SCUBA divers, along with those reported in the literature, we recommend caution in patients with cochlear implants who SCUBA dive regularly and strict adherence to the recommended safety limits.

      Underwater divers face several potential neurological hazards when breathing compressed gas mixtures including nitrogen narcosis which can impact diver's safety. Various human studies have clearly demonstrated brain impairment due to nitrogen narcosis in divers at 4 ATA using critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF) as a cortical performance indicator. However, recently some authors have proposed a probable adaptive phenomenon during repetitive exposure to high nitrogen pressure in rats, where they found a reversal effect on dopamine release.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixty experienced divers breathing Air, Trimix or Heliox, were studied during an open water dive to a depth of 6 ATA with a square profile testing CFFF measurement before (T0), during the dive upon arriving at the bottom (6 ATA) (T1), 20 min of bottom time (T2), and at 5 m (1.5 ATA) (T3).
    


          Results:
        
      
      CFFF results showed a slight increase in alertness and arousal during the deep dive regardless of the gas mixture breathed. The percent change in CFFF values at T1 and T2 differed among the three groups being lower in the air group than in the other groups. All CFFF values returned to basal values 5 min before the final ascent at 5 m (T3), but the Trimix measurements were still slightly better than those at T0.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results highlight that nitrogen and oxygen alone and in combination can produce neuronal excitability or depression in a dose-related response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30350155/,2022-11-27 11:19:14 PM
Early detection of diving-related cognitive impairment of different nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures using critical flicker fusion frequency,"Pierre Lafère, Walter Hemelryck, Peter Germonpré, Lyubisa Matity, François Guerrero, Costantino Balestra, Pierre Lafère, Walter Hemelryck, Peter Germonpré, Lyubisa Matity, François Guerrero, Costantino Balestra",2019 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Cognitive impairment related to inert gas narcosis (IGN) is a threat to diving safety and operations at depth that might be reduced by using enriched air nitrox (EANx) mixtures. Using critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), a possible early detection of cognitive abilities/cerebral arousal impairment when breathing different oxygen (O2) fractions was investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight male volunteers performed, in random order, two dry chamber dives breathing either air or EANx40 (40% O₂-60% nitrogen) for 20 minutes (min) at 0.4 MPa. Cognition and arousal were assessed before the dive; upon arrival at 0.4 MPa; after 15 min exposure at 0.4 MPa; on surfacing and 30 min post-dive using behavioural computer-based testing psychology experiment building language (PEBL) and by CFFF while continuously recording brain oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In both breathing conditions, CFFF and PEBL demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (Pearson r of -0.90, P < 0.0001), improved cognitive abilities/cerebral arousal occurred upon arrival at 0.4 MPa followed by a progressive deterioration. Initial brain activation was associated with a significant increase in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) and a simultaneous decrease of deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb). The magnitude of the changes was significantly greater under EANx (P = 0.038).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Since changes were not related to haemodynamic variables, HbO₂ and HHb values indicate a significant, O₂-dependent activation in the prefrontal cortex. Owing to the correlation with some tests from the PEBL, CFFF could be a convenient measure of cognitive performance/ability in extreme environments, likely under the direct influence of oxygen partial pressure, a potent modulator of IGN symptoms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177518/,2022-11-27 11:19:15 PM
Monitoring cardiac output during hyperbaric oxygen treatment of haemodynamically unstable patients,"Marco Bo Hansen, Frederik Treschow, Martin Skielboe, Ole Hyldegaard, Erik Christian Jansen, Jonas Bille Nielsen, Marco Bo Hansen, Frederik Treschow, Martin Skielboe, Ole Hyldegaard, Erik Christian Jansen, Jonas Bille Nielsen",2013 Mar,"Introduction:
        
      
      Patients suffering from necrotizing fasciitis (NF) are often haemodynamically unstable and require extended monitoring of cardiovascular parameters; yet this is limited during hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). We aimed to evaluate the use and safety of transoesophageal Doppler (TED) monitoring of cardiac output (CO) under hyperbaric conditions in haemodynamically unstable patients diagnosed with NF and sepsis or septic shock.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cardiac output was measured prior to, during and after HBOT with the use of TED in seven consecutive patients diagnosed with NF and sepsis or septic shock. The HBOT followed our standard protocol for NF patients, consisting of 90 minutes' exposure to 100% oxygen at 284 kPa. The difference between mean CO just prior to HBOT initiation and at near-maximum treatment duration was assessed using the Student's paired t-test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TED was feasible and easy to use under hyperbaric conditions. We experienced no problems with the measurement of CO or with equipment-related safety during HBOT. Five patients had an increase in CO from initiation of HBOT to near-maximum treatment duration, one patient had a stable CO, while one patient experienced a slight decrease in CO. Overall, there was an increase in mean CO of 1.7 L min-1 (95% CI 0.02 to 3.34 L min-1, P = 0.048) from initiation of HBOT to near-maximum treatment duration.
    


          Conclusion:

      This study examined all known diving-related fatalities in Queensland, Australia, from 2000 to 2019 to determine likely causes and potential countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were extracted from the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation fatality database, including previously published reports. The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify diving-related deaths in Queensland for 2014-2019 and data were extracted, analysed, and combined with previously published data covering the period 2000-2013. Descriptive statistics and parametric and non-parametric tests were used to analyse these data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 166 snorkelling and 41 scuba victims identified with median ages of 59 and 49 years respectively, and 83% of snorkel and 64% of scuba victims were males. One quarter of snorkel and 40% of scuba victims were obese. Two-thirds of the snorkellers and three quarters of scuba divers were overseas tourists. Contributory predisposing health conditions were identified in 61% of snorkel and 50% of scuba victims. Nine scuba victims died on their first dive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The increase in snorkelling deaths likely reflects increased participation, higher age, and poorer health. The main disabling condition in both cohorts was cardiac-related. Pre-existing health conditions, poor skills, inexperience, poor planning, supervision shortcomings and lack of effective buddy systems featured in both cohorts, and apnoeic hypoxia in breath-hold divers. Suggested countermeasures include improved education on the importance of health and fitness for safe diving and snorkelling, increased emphasis on an honest and accurate pre-activity health declaration and subsequent implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies, improved supervision, better buddy pairing, and on-going education on the hazards of extended apnoea.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732283/,2022-11-27 11:19:17 PM

Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Observation of Vastus Lateralis (Muscle) and Prefrontal Cortex (Brain) Tissue Oxygenation During Synchronised Swimming Routines in Elite Athletes,"B Jones, C E Cooper, B Jones, C E Cooper",2018,"The development of underwater Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (uNIRS) has enabled the measurement of tissue oxygenation within the swim environment. Unique physiological responses, such as the diving reflex, have been shown to occur during synchronized swimming and demonstrate an innate oxygen-conserving reflex. However, the prevalence of a sudden loss of consciousness ('hypoxic blackout') is an ongoing concern in this swim population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reported low tissue oxygen conditions experienced in elite level synchronized swimmers (SyncS) during swim routines. Changes in peripheral muscle and brain oxygenation (Tissue Saturation Index (TSI %)) were continuously recorded during simulated synchronized swim routines. Six elite female synchronized swimmers were assessed; age 29.0 ± 4.4 years; height 168.4 ± 7.1 cm; weight 53.2 ± 3.2 kg; quadriceps skin fold; 10.2 ± 0.8 mm; ΔTSI (%) between the vastus lateralis (VL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were analyzed using paired (two-tailed) t-tests. The level of significance for analysis was set at p < 0.05. Significant difference (p = 0.001) was found in ΔTSI (%) between the VL and PFC. During dynamic leg kicking exercise, the initial effect of each leg kicking sequence is a rapid drop in TSI (%). This is consistent with an initial constriction (drop in blood flow in the muscle) accompanied by an increase in oxygen consumption. Cerebral oxygenation (PFC) remained largely unchanged during both maximal breath-hold and during vigorous exercise, presumably due to protective mechanisms in the brain in this population. We conclude that uNIRS is able to provide novel insights into SyncS hemodynamic responses and could be used to inform on the safety of new routines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30178332/,2022-11-27 11:19:18 PM
The transition from day-to-night activity is a risk factor for the development of CNS oxygen toxicity in the diurnal fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus),"Mirit Eynan, Adi Biram, Michael Mullokandov, Noga Kronfeld-Schor, Rotem Paz-Cohen, Dvir Menajem, Yehuda Arieli, Mirit Eynan, Adi Biram, Michael Mullokandov, Noga Kronfeld-Schor, Rotem Paz-Cohen, Dvir Menajem, Yehuda Arieli",2017,"Performance and safety are impaired in employees engaged in shift work. Combat divers who use closed-circuit oxygen diving apparatus undergo part of their training during the night hours. The greatest risk involved in diving with such apparatus is the development of central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT). We investigated whether the switch from day-to-night activity may be a risk factor for the development of CNS-OT using a diurnal animal model, the fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus). Animals were kept on a 12:12 light-dark schedule (6 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 500 lx). The study included two groups: (1) Control group: animals were kept awake and active during the day, between 09:00 and 15:00. (2) Experimental group: animals were kept awake and active during the night, between 21:00 and 03:00, when they were exposed to dim light in order to simulate the conditions prevalent during combat diver training. This continued for a period of 3 weeks, 5 days a week. On completion of this phase, 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) levels in urine were determined over a period of 24 h. Animals were then exposed to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). To investigate the effect of acute melatonin administration, melatonin (50 mg/kg) or its vehicle was administered to the animals in both groups 20 min prior to HBO exposure. After the exposure, the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase was measured, as were the levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and overall nitrotyrosylation in the cortex and hippocampus. Latency to CNS-OT was significantly reduced after the transition from day-to-night activity. This was associated with alterations in the level of melatonin metabolites secreted in the urine. Acute melatonin administration had no effect on latency to CNS-OT in either of the groups. Nevertheless, the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as nitrotyrosine and nNOS levels, were altered in the hippocampus following melatonin administration. On the basis of these results, we suggest that a switch from diurnal to nocturnal activity may represent an additional risk factor for the development of CNS-OT. Utilizing a diurnal animal model may contribute to our understanding of the heightened risk of developing CNS-OT when diving with closed-circuit oxygen apparatus at night.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28156158/,2022-11-27 11:19:19 PM

Impact of Fire Suit Ensembles on Firefighter PAH Exposures as Assessed by Skin Deposition and Urinary Biomarkers,"Håkan Wingfors, Jenny Rattfelt Nyholm, Roger Magnusson, Cecilia Hammar Wijkmark, Håkan Wingfors, Jenny Rattfelt Nyholm, Roger Magnusson, Cecilia Hammar Wijkmark",2018 Feb 13,"Over the past 10 years, a number of safety measures for reducing firefighters' exposure to combustion particles have been introduced in Sweden. The most important measure was the reduction in the time firefighters wear suits and handle contaminated equipment after turn-outs involving smoke diving. This study was divided into two parts, those being to investigate the level of protection obtained by multiple garment layers and to assess exposure during a standardized smoke diving exercise. First, realistic work protection factors (WPFs) were calculated by comparing air concentrations of the full suite of gaseous and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) inside and outside structural ensembles, including jacket and thick base layer, during a tough fire extinguishing exercise using wood as the fuel. Second, during a standardized smoke diving exercise, exposure was assessed by measuring PAH skin deposition and levels of eight urinary PAH metabolites in 20 volunteer student firefighters before and after the exercise. The average WPF for the sum of 22 PAHs was 146 ± 33 suggesting a relatively high protective capacity but also indicating a substantial enrichment of contaminants with a risk of prolonged dermal exposure. Accordingly, in the second exercise, the median levels of skin-deposited Σ14-PAHs and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene significantly increased 5-fold (21 to 99 ng/wipe) and 8-fold (0.14 to 1.1 µmol mol-1 creatinine), respectively, post exposure. Among the PAH metabolites investigated, 1-hydroxypyrene proved to be the most useful indicator of exposure, with significantly elevated urinary levels at both 6 h and 20 h after the exercise and with the strongest correlation to dermal exposure. Metabolites from two-ring and three-ring PAHs were eliminated faster while levels of 3-hydroxy-benzo[a]pyrene did not meet the detection criteria. The results from correlation studies indicated that dermal uptake was a major route of exposure in accordance with previous findings. To summarize, this study shows that some of the newly adopted protective measures were correctly implemented, and should continue to be followed and be more widely adopted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29236997/,2022-11-27 11:19:21 PM
Prevalence and Risk Factors for Hearing Loss in Chilean Shellfish Divers,"Marie Astrid Garrido Campos, Benedikt Anselm Hindelang, Denise Siqueira De Carvalho, Ilse Urzúa Finke, Ronald Herrera, Katja Radon, Marie Astrid Garrido Campos, Benedikt Anselm Hindelang, Denise Siqueira De Carvalho, Ilse Urzúa Finke, Ronald Herrera, Katja Radon",2018 Aug 31,"Background:
        
      
      Diving within artisanal fishing is a profession carried out by many men in coastal communities of southern Chile. These shellfish divers use surface supplied air for breathing. Among potential health threats are occupational accidents, decompression sickness and barotrauma. Repeated middle and inner ear barotrauma and decompression sickness of the ear may result in hearing loss.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the prevalence of hearing loss and related risk factors in artisanal shellfish divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study including 125 male shellfish divers was carried out in a coastal village in southern Chile. Participants were interviewed using a standard Spanish questionnaire adapted for this population. Hearing loss was assessed through audiometry. Any hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and other types of hearing loss (conduction, unilateral and mixed) were used as the outcomes. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were carried out to identify risk factors for hearing loss.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Median duration on the job was 25 years (range 1-52), 64% of divers had a low level of schooling and 52% reported not knowing how to use decompression tables. Most (86%) of the divers dove deeper than 30 meters exceeding the 20 meters permitted by law. The majority (80%) reported having experienced several episodes of type II decompression sickness during their working life. The prevalence of any type of hearing loss was 54.4%: 29.0% presented sensorineural hearing loss and 25.6% presented other types of hearing impairment. After adjustment for age and other potential risk factors, diving more than 25 years was the main predictor for all kinds of hearing loss under study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Hearing loss is frequent in artisanal shellfish divers and safety measures are limited. Although based on small numbers and lacking an unexposed comparison group, our results suggest the need for community-based interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835386/,2022-11-27 11:19:21 PM
Using driving simulator to study the effect of crash fact signs on speeding behaviour along freeways,"Fadi Alhomaidat, Raed Abdullah Hasan, Shadi Hanandeh, Wael Alhajyaseen, Fadi Alhomaidat, Raed Abdullah Hasan, Shadi Hanandeh, Wael Alhajyaseen",2022 Aug 19,"A driving simulator study was utilized to evaluate a potential countermeasure for speeding behaviour in order to reduce speed spillover. The behaviour of 56 subjects was observed. Participants drove a freeway for 5300 metres before exiting onto a three-kilometre urban arterial. Field data from trajectory speed profiles validated the diving simulator results. The impact of the Crash Fact Sign (CFS), a sign that provides information about the number of crashes/fatalities that occurred on that particular road, and Warning Sign (W.S.) on regions affected by speed spillover was investigated. Each subject was asked to drive in four different scenarios: (1) an additional speed limit sign (SLS-2); (2) Warning Sign (W.S.); (3) Crash Fact Sign (CFS); and (4) Crash Fact Sign with Additional Speed Limit Sign (CFS&SLS-2). The study finds CFS&SLS-2 to be the most effective countermeasure because it produces significant average speed reductions, reached 7.8 km, in the area under speed spillover effect. Furthermore, the effect of a traffic signal at the exit urban arterial on speed spillover behaviour was investigated. The speed spillover effect was observed at longer distances when drivers did not stop at the signalized intersection than when drivers stopped.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35984705/,2022-11-27 11:19:22 PM
The relationship of decongestant use and risk of decompression sickness; a case-control study of Hawaiian scuba divers,"Richard W Smerz, Richard W Smerz",2014 Feb,"Exposure to cold, dehydration, and aging are known to contribute to the development of decompression sickness (DCS) in divers. Hypertension and nicotine usage have also been suggested as risk factors. Vasoconstriction is an underlying mechanism associated with all of these risk factors. Vasoconstriction increases the degree of bubble formation which is believed to be the cause of DCS. Formed bubbles interfere with the production of nitric oxide which modulates vascular tone resulting in vasoconstriction. Divers commonly use sympathomimetic decongestants which induce vasoconstriction to prevent barotrauma of the ears and sinuses while diving and thus theoretically may contribute to the risk for developing DCS. The purpose of this case-control study was to explore the association between decongestant usage and development of DCS in 400 divers treated/evaluated at the University of Hawai'i, John A. Burns School of Medicine between 1983 and 2010. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were employed to evaluate differences between cases and controls. In addition to the variable of interest, other co-variables known to have significant influence in the development of DCS were appropriately controlled for during the analyses. In this study population, dehydration (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.4), repetitive diving (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.8, 4.4), and violation of dive profiles (OR = 4.9; 95% CI: 3.1, 7.9) contributed independently and significantly to the development of DCS. The co-variables of cold, gender, obesity, and rapid ascents were not significant contributors to developing DCS in this study. There was a small but statistically insignificant risk associated with decongestant use (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 0.8-2.6; P = .22). The inherent limitations associated with records-based studies may have underestimated this risk. It is important therefore that future research be undertaken to help clarify this concern.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24567870/,2022-11-27 11:19:23 PM
How we('ll) treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future,"Antonio Maria Risitano, Régis Peffault de Latour, Antonio Maria Risitano, Régis Peffault de Latour",2022 Jan,"Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis, severe thrombophilia and bone marrow failure. While for patients with bone marrow failure the treatment follows that of immune-mediated aplastic anaemia, that of classic, haemolytic PNH is based on anti-complement medication. The anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab has revolutionized treatment, resulting in control of intravascular haemolysis and thromboembolic risk, with improved long-term survival. Novel strategies of complement inhibition are emerging. New anti-C5 agents reproduce the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, with improved patient convenience.

Validation of algorithms used in commercial off-the-shelf dive computers,"Doug Fraedrich, Doug Fraedrich",2018 Dec 24,"Introduction:
        
      
      Whilst the US Navy has been very systematic about validating Navy dive computer algorithms, there has been little documented or published evidence of rigorous testing of the algorithms in commercial off-the-shelf dive computers. This paper reports the evaluation of four algorithms used in these - Bühlmann ZHL-16C; VPM-B; Suunto-RGBM; EMC-20H - by comparison with US Navy experimental dives with known decompression sickness outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three specific tests were developed to test the algorithms' ability to mitigate decompression sickness: Total decompression time; no stop times and first stop depth. Output of commercial decompression algorithms were compared to either the probability of decompression sickness (PDCS) results from US Navy man-trials or statistical models derived from PDCS data. The algorithms were first tested with default conservative factors, then these factors were adjusted if the tests were not initially passed. The last verification step was to compare the output of the wrist computer with that of the full desktop algorithm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This testing indicated that, whilst none of the four passed all of the proposed tests with factory-default conservatism, ZHL-16C and Suunto-RGBM could be made to pass by adjusting user-defined settings.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Man-trial data on PDCS is available to the non-US Navy scientific community for testing of commercial decompression algorithms. This type of validation testing can be very informative on how to best use available commercial dive computers to improve diver safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30517958/,2022-11-27 11:19:25 PM
A Doppler ultrasound self-monitoring approach for detection of relevant individual decompression stress in scuba diving,"Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt P Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch, Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt P Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch",2022 Jan,"Observing modern decompression protocols alone cannot fully prevent diving injuries especially in repetitive diving. Professional audio Doppler bubble measurements are not available to sports scuba divers. If those non-professionals were able to learn audio Doppler self-assessment for bubble grading, such skill could provide significant information on individual decisions with respect to diving safety. We taught audio Doppler self-assessment of subclavian and precordial probe position to 41 divers in a 45-min standardized, didactically optimized training. Assessment before and after air dives within sports diving limits was made through 684 audio Doppler measurements in dive-site conditions by both trained divers and a medical professional, plus additional 2D-echocardiography reference. In all dives (average maximum depth 22 m; dive time 44 min), 33% of all echocardiography measurements revealed bubbles. The specificity of audio bubble detection in combination of both detection sites was 95%, and sensitivity over all grades was 40%, increasing with higher bubble grades. Dive-site audio-Doppler-grading underestimated echo-derived bubble grades. Bubble detection sensitivity of audio Doppler self-assessments, compared to an experienced examiner, was 62% at subclavian and 73% at precordial position. 6 months after the training and 4.5 months after the last measurement, the achieved Doppler skill level remained stable. Audio Doppler self-assessment can be learned by non-professionals in a single teaching intervention. Despite accurate bubble grading is impossible in dive-site conditions, relevant high bubble grades can be detected by non-professionals. This qualitative information can be important in self-evaluating decompression stress and assessing measures for increased diving safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34241767/,2022-11-27 11:19:26 PM
The effect of using a pre-dive checklist on the incidence of diving mishaps in recreational scuba diving: a cluster-randomized trial,"Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Petar J Denoble, Charles Poole, Kristen L Kucera, Stephen W Marshall, Steve Wing, Shabbar I Ranapurwala, Petar J Denoble, Charles Poole, Kristen L Kucera, Stephen W Marshall, Steve Wing",2016 Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Scuba diving mishaps, caused by equipment problems or human errors, increase the occurrence of injuries and fatalities while diving. Pre-dive checklists may mitigate mishaps. This study evaluated the effect of using a pre-dive checklist on the incidence of diving mishaps in recreational divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multi-location cluster-randomized trial with parallel groups and allocation concealment was conducted between 1 June and 17 August 2012. The participants had to be at least 18 years of age, permitted to dive by the dive operator and planning to dive on the day of participation. They were recruited at the pier and dive boats at four locations. The intervention group received a pre-dive checklist and post-dive log. The control group received a post-dive log only. The outcomes, self-reported major and minor mishaps, were prompted by a post-dive questionnaire. Mishap rates per 100 dives were compared using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations. Intent-to-treat, per-protocol and marginal structural model analyses were conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1043 divers (intervention = 617; control = 426) made 2041 dives, on 70 location-days (intervention = 40; control = 30) at four locations. Compared with the control group, the incidence of major mishaps decreased in the intervention group by 36%, minor mishaps by 26% and all mishaps by 32%. On average, there was one fewer mishap in every 25 intervention dives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this trial, pre-dive checklist use prevented mishaps which could lead to injuries and fatalities. Pre-dive checklists can increase diving safety and their use should be promoted.

Systematic review on the effects of medication under hyperbaric conditions: consequences for the diver,"Erik Hoencamp, Thijs Tcf van Dongen, Pieter-Jan Am van Ooij, Thijs T Wingelaar, Mees L Vervelde, Dave Aa Koch, Rob A van Hulst, Rigo Hoencamp, Erik Hoencamp, Thijs Tcf van Dongen, Pieter-Jan Am van Ooij, Thijs T Wingelaar, Mees L Vervelde, Dave Aa Koch, Rob A van Hulst, Rigo Hoencamp",2019 Jun 30,"Background:
        
      
      Physiological changes are induced by immersion, swimming and using diving equipment. Divers must be fit to dive. Using medication may impact the capacity to adapt to hyperbaric conditions. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the interaction of diving/hyperbaric conditions and medication and to provide basic heuristics to support decision making regarding fitness to dive in medicated divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a systematic review of human and animal studies of medications in the hyperbaric environment. Studies were subdivided into those describing a medication/hyperbaric environment interaction and those concerned with prevention of diving disorders. Studies without a relation to diving with compressed air, and those concerning oxygen toxicity, hyperbaric oxygen therapy or the treatment of decompression sickness were excluded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-four studies matched the inclusion criteria. Animal studies revealed that diazepam and valproate gave limited protection against the onset of the high-pressure neurological syndrome. Lithium had a protective effect against nitrogen-narcosis and losartan reduced cardiac changes in repetitive diving. Human studies showed no beneficial or dangerous pressure-related interactions. In prevention of diving disorders, pseudoephedrine reduced otic barotrauma, vitamins C and E reduced endothelial dysfunction after bounce diving and hepatic oxidative stress in saturation diving.
    


          Discussion and conclusions:
        
      
      Animal studies revealed that psycho-pharmaceuticals can limit the onset of neurologic symptoms and cardiovascular protective drugs might add a potential protective effect against decompression sickness. No evidence of significant risks due to changes in pharmacologic mechanisms were revealed and most medication is not a contraindication to diving. For improving decision making in prescribing medicine for recreational and occupational divers and to enhance safety by increasing our understanding of pharmacology in hyperbaric conditions, future research should focus on controlled human studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177519/,2022-11-27 11:19:27 PM
First impressions: Use of the Azoth Systems O'Dive subclavian bubble monitor on a liveaboard dive vessel,"Peter Germonpré, Paul Van der Eecken, Elke Van Renterghem, Faye-Lisa Germonpré, Costantino Balestra, Peter Germonpré, Paul Van der Eecken, Elke Van Renterghem, Faye-Lisa Germonpré, Costantino Balestra",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      The Azoth Systems O'Dive bubble monitor is marketed at recreational and professional divers as a tool to improve personal diving decompression safety. We report the use of this tool during a 12-day dive trip aboard a liveaboard vessel.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six divers were consistently monitored according to the user manual of the O'Dive system. Data were synchronised with the Azoth server whenever possible (depending on cell phone data signal). Information regarding ease of use, diver acceptance and influence on dive behaviour were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 157 dives were completely monitored over 11 diving days. Formal evaluations were only available after six days because of internet connection problems. Sixty-one dives resulted in the detection of bubbles, mostly in one diver, none of which produced any symptoms of decompression illness.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The O'Dive system may contribute to increasing dive safety by making divers immediately aware of the potential consequences of certain types of diving behaviour. It was noted that bubble monitoring either reinforced divers in their safe diving habits or incited them to modify their dive planning. Whether this is a lasting effect is not known.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325023/,2022-11-27 11:19:29 PM
Establishment of a fish model to study gas-bubble lesions,"Alicia Velázquez-Wallraf, Antonio Fernández, María José Caballero, Marina Arregui, Óscar González Díaz, Mónica B Betancor, Yara Bernaldo de Quirós, Alicia Velázquez-Wallraf, Antonio Fernández, María José Caballero, Marina Arregui, Óscar González Díaz, Mónica B Betancor, Yara Bernaldo de Quirós",2022 Apr 21,"Decompression sickness (DCS) is a clinical syndrome caused by the formation of systemic intravascular and extravascular gas bubbles. The presence of these bubbles in blood vessels is known as gas embolism. DCS has been described in humans and animals such as sea turtles and cetaceans. To delve deeper into DCS, experimental models in terrestrial mammals subjected to compression/decompression in a hyperbaric chamber have been used. Fish can suffer from gas bubble disease (GBD), characterized by the formation of intravascular and extravascular systemic gas bubbles, similarly to that observed in DCS. Given these similarities and the fact that fish develop this disease naturally in supersaturated water, they could be used as an alternative experimental model for the study of the pathophysiological aspect of gas bubbles. The objective of this study was to obtain a reproducible model for GBD in fish by an engineering system and a complete pathological study, validating this model for the study of the physiopathology of gas related lesions in DCS. A massive and severe GBD was achieved by exposing the fish for 18 h to TDG values of 162-163%, characterized by the presence of severe hemorrhages and the visualization of massive quantities of macroscopic and microscopic gas bubbles, systemically distributed, circulating through different large vessels of experimental fish. These pathological findings were the same as those described in small mammals for the study of explosive DCS by hyperbaric chamber, validating the translational usefulness of this first fish model to study the gas-bubbles lesions associated to DCS from a pathological standpoint.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449183/,2022-11-27 11:19:29 PM
Immersion pulmonary edema: case reports from Oceania,"Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock, Carl Edmonds, John Lippmann, Andrew Fock",2019,"Introduction:
        
      
      We aimed to document identified cases of immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) in divers from Oceania (the Indo-Pacific region) from January 2002 to May 2018, inclusive.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Cases were identified using various sources, including searches of the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) Fatality Database, published case reports, and interviews with survivors who had reported their incident to DAN AP. Where available, investigations, pathology and autopsy results were obtained. Only incidents diagnosed as IPE by diving physicians or pathologists with experience in the investigation of diving accidents were included. Individual case histories and outcomes, together with brief individual summaries of the associations and possible contributing factors were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one IPE incidents in divers from Oceania were documented. There were two surface snorkelers, 22 scuba air divers and seven nitrox divers which included three closed-circuit rebreathers (CCR). The mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years, 58% of victims were females, and the average dive profile was to a maximum depth of 19 meters of seawater for 25 minutes. Six victims (19%) had previous episodes of IPE. There were nine recorded fatalities. Cardiac anomalies dominated the associated or possible contributing factors. These included valvular disease in 29%, transient cardiomyopathies in 26% and dysrhythmias in 16%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Previously reported associations of IPE such as exertion, stress, cold exposure, negative inspiratory pressure, hypertension, overhydration, ascent or surfacing, tight wetsuit, aspiration and certain medications were identified. Cardiac conditions were frequent and included chronic disorders (valvular pathology, coronary artery disease) and transient disorders (dysrhythmias, transient myocardial dysfunction, takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy). It is likely that the chronic cardiac disorders may have contributed to the IPE, whereas the transient cases could be either sequelae, contributors or coincidental to the IPE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683356/,2022-11-27 11:19:30 PM

          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify scuba diving-related deaths from 2001-2013, inclusive. Coronial findings, witness and police reports, medical histories and autopsies, toxicology and equipment reports were scrutinised. These were analysed for predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and causes of death using a validated template.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 known scuba diving fatalities and 189 predisposing factors were identified, the major being health conditions (59; 47%), organisational/training/experience/skills issues (46; 37%), planning shortcomings (29; 23%) and equipment inadequacies (24; 19%). The 138 suspected triggers included environmental (68; 54%), exertion (23; 18%) and gas supply problems (15; 12%) among others. The 121 identified disabling agents included medical-related (48; 38%), ascent-related (21; 17%), poor buoyancy control (18; 14%), gas supply (17; 13%), environmental (13; 10%) and equipment (4; 3%). The main disabling injuries were asphyxia (37%), cardiac (25%) and cerebral arterial gas embolism/pulmonary barotrauma (15%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Chronic medical conditions, predominantly cardiac-related, are a major contributor to diving incidents. Divers with such conditions and/or older divers should undergo thorough fitness-to-dive assessments. Appropriate local knowledge, planning and monitoring are important to minimise the potential for incidents triggered by adverse environmental conditions, most of which involve inexperienced divers. Chain of events analysis should increase understanding of diving incidents and has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957123/,2022-11-27 11:19:32 PM
Continuous real-time monitoring and recording of glycemia during scuba diving: pilot study,"Massimo Pieri, Danilo Cialoni, Alessandro Marroni, Massimo Pieri, Danilo Cialoni, Alessandro Marroni",2016 May-Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Insulin-dependent diabetes has been considered a scuba diving contraindication. This is currently being reconsidered for well-controlled diabetes. We developed a real-time continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to check glycemia, or blood glucose (BG), during diving, both for prospective studies and to increase diabetic diver safety, allowing for real-time control of glycemia and hypoglycemia prevention. To ensure CGM measurement accuracy we tested the method under hyperbaric conditions.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Two experienced diabetic divers were studied during a one-week diving cruise. BG was monitored every five minutes on every dive, by a dedicated CGM, and values were visible to the divers throughout their dives. The mean of relative difference (MRD) between CGM and capillary blood glucose was calculated. Measurement accuracy was assessed according to ISO guideline 15197 and by Clarke Error Grid (CEG) analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both divers showed gradual BG decrease during diving. Hyperbaric chamber accuracy tests showed two of 26 MRD values (7.7%) slightly exceeding the ISO-15197 allowed difference (5%). However, our data suggest that this discrepancy may have been an artefact.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Our data (even limited to two subjects only) agree with the current literature showing that also in our investigated subjects diving does not imply significant risks of hypoglycemia. The use of a real-time CGM by diabetic divers during their dives can provide immediate information on BG values and trends, thus significantly improving diving safety. The accuracy tests comparing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and capillary blood glucose measurement (CBM) data recorded under hyperbaric conditions showed that data recorded under pressure are very close to the ISO-15197 and CEG acceptable limits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27416695/,2022-11-27 11:19:33 PM
The demographics and diving behaviour of DAN Asia-Pacific members with and without pre-existing medical conditions,"John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Simon Mitchell, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Simon Mitchell",2016 Dec,"Introduction:
        
      
      This report examines Diver Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) members with and without cardiac or respiratory conditions, diabetes or hypertension and compares their demographics, health and diving activities.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      Two online cross-sectional surveys of DAN AP members were conducted. The first sought information from 833 divers who applied for membership between July 2009 and August 2013 and who had declared the targeted medical conditions. The second, conducted between December 2014 and April 2015, was sent to 9,927 current members with known email addresses. The groups were compared for age, gender, body mass index, fitness, smoking and diving qualifications, history, currency and practices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 343 (41%) respondents to the first survey, 267 (32%) provided sufficient information for inclusion. Of 1,786 (18%) respondents to the second survey, 1,437 (15%) had no targeted medical condition and were included in the analysis. Those with medical conditions were on average 4.7 years older (P 〈 0.001); more overweight or obese (68% versus 57%, P = 0.001); took more medications (57% vs. 29%, P 〈 0.001), smoked less (4% vs. 7%, P = 0.02) and did less repetitive diving (median 75 vs 90, P 〈 0.001). Other diving demographics were similar.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A substantial number of people are diving with medical conditions and there is a need to better understand the associated risks. Divers need to be well-educated about the potential impact such conditions may have on diving safety and should monitor their health status, especially as they age.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27966201/,2022-11-27 11:19:34 PM

"Rescue and resuscitation factors in scuba diving and snorkeling fatalities in Australia, 2001-2013","John Lippmann, John Lippmann",2020 First Quarter,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to examine first aid measures applied in a large series of Australian dive-related fatalities to better determine where improvements can be made.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System was searched to identify scuba diving and snorkeling-related cases reported to various Australian Coroners for the years 2001-2013 inclusive. Coronial documents examined included witness statements, police reports and ambulance and medical reports where available. Information relating to the recovery, rescue and/or resuscitation of the victims was extracted, compiled and analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      126 scuba diving and 175 snorkeling-related fatalities were identified during the study period, with airway management complications reported in one-third. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in three-quarters of the incidents. An automated external defibrillator was attached to 40 victims as a first aid measure, and shocks were indicated and delivered in five cases. Although three-quarters of the reports included no information about whether supplemental oxygen was provided, it was confirmed in 19% of both the scuba diving and snorkeling incidents.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There were often considerable delays in the recognition, rescue and/or recovery of an unconscious snorkeler or diver and, consequently, the time to commencement of basic life support. Such delays can affect chances of survival and need to be minimized. Delivery of supplemental oxygen during resuscitation appears to be relatively infrequent and sometimes suboptimal; improvement appears necessary. Some measures that would have improved availability and/or better use in these cases include the selection of appropriate equipment compatible with likely circumstances and operator skills; improved training and ongoing skills practice; and regular checking and maintenance of equipment. Improved data collection and recording by official on-site investigators, preferably with knowledge of diving, would better inform potential or necessary improvements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32176951/,2022-11-27 11:19:35 PM
Lung Function in Traditional Shellfish Divers in Southern Chile-A Cross-Sectional Study,"Lorenz Mark, Marie Astrid Garrido, Dennis Nowak, Katja Radon, Laura Wengenroth, Lorenz Mark, Marie Astrid Garrido, Dennis Nowak, Katja Radon, Laura Wengenroth",2021 Oct 11,"The long-term effects of diving on human lung function are controversially discussed. We investigated the lung function of traditional shellfish divers in southern Chile and identified risk factors for reduced lung volumes in divers. In a cross-sectional study, we assessed lung function in traditional shellfish divers and fishermen from two fishing communities. Male divers and fishermen aged 18-60 years were recruited. Participants' health and diving habits were assessed via standardized questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests and multiple linear regression models were applied. Through door-to-door sampling, we recruited 112 divers and 63 fishermen (response 67%). Valid spirometries were obtained from 98 divers and 52 fishermen. Divers had higher values of forced vital capacity (FVC, Beta = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09; 0.47) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, Beta = 0.23, 95%-CI: 0.07; 0.39) compared to fishermen. Among divers, lower values of FVC (Beta = -0.35, 95%-CI: -0.65; -0.05) were found in those with a high diving frequency, while diving depth was associated with higher values of FVC (Beta = 0.28, 95%-CI = 0.04; 0.52). Professional divers had better lung function compared to fishermen. However, among divers, lung function decreased with cumulative diving exposure, warranting approval in future studies to ensure the safety and health of divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34682387/,2022-11-27 11:19:36 PM
Distributed improvisation: a systems perspective of improvisation 'epics' by led outdoor activity leaders,"Margaret J Trotter, Paul M Salmon, Natassia Goode, Michael G Lenné, Margaret J Trotter, Paul M Salmon, Natassia Goode, Michael G Lenné",2018 Feb,"Improvisation represents the spontaneous and real-time conception and execution of a novel response to an unanticipated situation. In order to benefit from the positive safety potential of this phenomenon, it is necessary to understand what influences its appropriateness and effectiveness. This study has applied the system-based methodology Impromaps to analysing accounts of improvisation aimed at mitigating adverse safety outcomes. These accounts were obtained from led outdoor activity (LOA) leaders through critical decision method interviews. Influencing factors and interactions have been identified across all system levels. The factors most influential to leaders' ability to improvise are 'Policy, procedures and rules', 'Organisation culture', 'Training', 'Role responsibilities', 'Communication/instruction/demonstration', 'Situation awareness', 'Leader experience', 'Mental simulation', 'Equipment, clothing & PPE' and 'Terrain/physical environment'. To enhance the likelihood of effective, appropriate improvisation, LOA providers are recommended to focus on higher level factors over which they are able to exert greater control. Practitioner Summary: To enhance resilience in safety-critical situations, organisations need to understand what influences appropriate, effective improvisation. To elucidate this, the Impromaps methodology is applied to in-depth interview data. The Impromap affords a graphical depiction of the influencing factors and interactions across the system, providing a basis for the development of interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28699840/,2022-11-27 11:19:37 PM
Analysis of recreational closed-circuit rebreather deaths 1998-2010,"Andrew W Fock, Andrew W Fock",2013 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Since the introduction of recreational closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) in 1998, there have been many recorded deaths. Rebreather deaths have been quoted to be as high as 1 in 100 users.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Rebreather fatalities between 1998 and 2010 were extracted from the Deeplife rebreather mortality database, and inaccuracies were corrected where known. Rebreather absolute numbers were derived from industry discussions and training agency statistics. Relative numbers and brands were extracted from the Rebreather World website database and a Dutch rebreather survey. Mortality was compared with data from other databases. A fault-tree analysis of rebreathers was compared to that of open-circuit scuba of various configurations. Finally, a risk analysis was applied to the mortality database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 181 recorded recreational rebreather deaths occurred at about 10 times the rate of deaths amongst open-circuit recreational scuba divers. No particular brand or type of rebreather was over-represented. Closed-circuit rebreathers have a 25-fold increased risk of component failure compared to a manifolded twin-cylinder open-circuit system. This risk can be offset by carrying a redundant 'bailout' system. Two-thirds of fatal dives were associated with a high-risk dive or high-risk behaviour. There are multiple points in the human-machine interface (HMI) during the use of rebreathers that can result in errors that may lead to a fatality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While rebreathers have an intrinsically higher risk of mechanical failure as a result of their complexity, this can be offset by good design incorporating redundancy and by carrying adequate 'bailout' or alternative gas sources for decompression in the event of a failure. Designs that minimize the chances of HMI errors and training that highlights this area may help to minimize fatalities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813461/,2022-11-27 11:19:37 PM
Dead or Alive? Factors Affecting the Survival of Victims during Attacks by Saltwater Crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Australia,"Yusuke Fukuda, Charlie Manolis, Keith Saalfeld, Alain Zuur, Yusuke Fukuda, Charlie Manolis, Keith Saalfeld, Alain Zuur",2015 May 11,"Conflicts between humans and crocodilians are a widespread conservation challenge and the number of crocodile attacks is increasing worldwide. We identified the factors that most effectively decide whether a victim is injured or killed in a crocodile attack by fitting generalized linear models to a 42-year dataset of 87 attacks (27 fatal and 60 non-fatal) by saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Australia. The models showed that the most influential factors were the difference in body mass between crocodile and victim, and the position of victim in relation to the water at the time of an attack. In-water position (for diving, swimming, and wading) had a higher risk than on-water (boating) or on-land (fishing, and hunting near the water's edge) positions. In the in-water position a 75 kg person would have a relatively high probability of survival (0.81) if attacked by a 300 cm crocodile, but the probability becomes much lower (0.17) with a 400 cm crocodile. If attacked by a crocodile larger than 450 cm, the survival probability would be extremely low (<0.05) regardless of the victim's size. These results indicate that the main cause of death during a crocodile attack is drowning and larger crocodiles can drag a victim more easily into deeper water. A higher risk associated with a larger crocodile in relation to victim's size is highlighted by children's vulnerability to fatal attacks. Since the first recently recorded fatal attack involving a child in 2006, six out of nine fatal attacks (66.7%) involved children, and the average body size of crocodiles responsible for these fatal attacks was considerably smaller (384 cm, 223 kg) than that of crocodiles that killed adults (450 cm, 324 kg) during the same period (2006-2014). These results suggest that culling programs targeting larger crocodiles may not be an effective management option to improve safety for children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961294/,2022-11-27 11:19:38 PM
Shallow water (paddling) variants of water maze tests in mice,"Robert M J Deacon, Robert M J Deacon",2013 Jun 3,"When Richard Morris devised his water maze in 1981(7), most behavioral work was done in rats. However, the greater understanding of mouse genetics led to the mouse becoming increasingly important. But researchers found that some strains of mutant mice were prone to problems like passively floating or diving when they were tested in the Morris water maze(11). This was unsurprising considering their natural habitat; rats swim naturally (classically, the ""sewer rat""), whereas mice evolved in the dry areas of central Asia. To overcome these problems, it was considered whether shallow water would be a sufficient stimulus to provide escape motivation for mice. This would also avoid the problems of drying the small creatures with a towel and then putting them in a heated recovery chamber to avoid hypothermia, which is a much more serious problem than with rats; the large ratio of surface area to volume of a mouse makes it particularly vulnerable to rapid heat loss. Another consideration was whether a more natural escape strategy could be used, to facilitate learning. Since animals that fall into water and swim away from the safety of the shore are unlikely to pass on their genes, animals have evolved a natural tendency to swim to the edge of a body of water. The Morris water maze, however, requires them to swim to a hidden platform towards the center of the maze - exactly opposite to their evolved behavior. Therefore the paddling maze should incorporate escape to the edge of the apparatus. This feature, coupled with the use of relatively non-aversive shallow water, embodies the ""Refinement"" aspect of the ""3 Rs"" of Russell and Burch(8). Various types of maze design were tried; the common feature was that the water was always shallow (2 cm deep) and escape was via a tube piercing the transparent wall of the apparatus. Other tubes (""false exits"") were also placed around the walls but these were blocked off. From the inside of the maze all false exits and the single true exit looked the same. Currently a dodecagonal (12-sided) maze is in use in Oxford, with 12 true/false exits set in the corners. In a recent development a transparent paddling Y-maze has been tested successfully.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23770614/,2022-11-27 11:19:39 PM
Moving in extreme environments: what's extreme and who decides?,"James David Cotter, Michael J Tipton, James David Cotter, Michael J Tipton",2014 Jun 11,"Humans work, rest and play in immensely varied extreme environments. The term 'extreme' typically refers to insufficiency or excess of one or more stressors, such as thermal energy or gravity. Individuals' behavioural and physiological capacity to endure and enjoy such environments varies immensely. Adverse effects of acute exposure to these environments are readily identifiable (e.g. heat stroke or bone fracture), whereas adverse effects of chronic exposure (e.g. stress fractures or osteoporosis) may be as important but much less discernable. Modern societies have increasingly sought to protect people from such stressors and, in that way, minimise their adverse effects. Regulations are thus established, and advice is provided on what is 'acceptable' exposure. Examples include work/rest cycles in the heat, hydration regimes, rates of ascent to and duration of stay at altitude and diving depth. While usually valuable and well intentioned, it is important to realise the breadth and importance of limitations associated with such guidelines. Regulations and advisories leave less room for self-determination, learning and perhaps adaptation. Regulations based on stress (e.g. work/rest cycles relative to WBGT) are more practical but less direct than those based on strain (e.g. core temperature), but even the latter can be substantively limited (e.g. by lack of criterion validation and allowance for behavioural regulation in the research on which they are based). Extreme Physiology & Medicine is publishing a series of reviews aimed at critically examining the issues involved with self- versus regulation-controlled human movement acutely and chronically in extreme environments. These papers, arising from a research symposium in 2013, are about the impact of people engaging in such environments and the effect of rules and guidelines on their safety, enjoyment, autonomy and productivity. The reviews will cover occupational heat stress, sporting heat stress, hydration, diving, extreme loading, chronic unloading and high altitude. Ramifications include factors such as health and safety, productivity, enjoyment and autonomy, acute and chronic protection and optimising adaptation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24921041/,2022-11-27 11:19:39 PM
Is there a role for hyberbaric oxygen as primary treatment for grade IV radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis? A prospective pilot-feasibility study and review of literature,"Athanasios Dellis, Charalambos Deliveliotis, Vasileios Kalentzos, Pavlos Vavasis, Andreas Skolarikos, Athanasios Dellis, Charalambos Deliveliotis, Vasileios Kalentzos, Pavlos Vavasis, Andreas Skolarikos",2014 May-Jun,"Purpose:
        
      
      To examine the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen as the primary treatment for Grade IV radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen was prospectively applied as a primary treatment option in 11 patients with Grade IV radiation cystitis. Primary endpoint was the incidence of complete and partial response to treatment. Secondary endpoints included the duration of response, the correlation of treatment success-rate to the interval between the onset of haematuria and initiation of therapy, blood transfusion need and total radiation dose, the number of sessions to success, the avoidance of surgery and the overall survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients completed therapy without complications for a mean follow-up of 17.82 months (range 3 to 34). Mean number of sessions needed was 32.8 (range 27 to 44). Complete and partial response rate was 81.8% and 18.2%, respectively. However, in three patients the first treatment session was not either sufficient or durable giving a 72.7% rate of durable effect. Interestingly, all 9 patients with complete response received therapy within 6 months of the haematuria onset compared to the two patients with partial response who received therapy at 8 and 10 months from the haematuria onset, respectively (p = 0.018). The need for blood transfusion (p = 0.491) and the total radiation dose (p = 0.259) were not correlated to success-rate. One patient needed cystectomy, while all patients were alive at the end of follow-up.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Early primary use of hyperbaric oxygen to treat radiation-induced grade IV cystitis is an effective and safe treatment option.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25010295/,2022-11-27 11:19:40 PM
"Hand sanitizers as a preventive measure in COVID-19 pandemic, its characteristics, and harmful effects: a review","Parixit Prajapati, Heli Desai, Chandni Chandarana, Parixit Prajapati, Heli Desai, Chandni Chandarana",2022 Feb 8,"Background:
        
      
      In the global health emergency caused by COVID-19, multiple experts have mandated the use of hand sanitizers as a safety measure from COVID-19. The sale of hand sanitizers has increased many folds. Therefore, when there is such large use of hand sanitizers, it becomes extremely important to study and understand hand sanitizers in a comprehensive manner. This article starts with the importance of sanitizers as a defence mechanism that is employed by the hand to fight against the coronavirus. This article provides information about history, types, composition, various dosage forms, and marketed formulations of hand sanitizers. The article sheds a detailed light on industrial production techniques for hand sanitizers and also outlines new innovative techniques that were employed by the industry to mass produce hand sanitizers in the wake of the pandemic. The article further dives into a comparison between hand sanitizers and soaps so as to give pros and cons of the use of soap against the use of hand sanitizers. One of the aims of the article is to study the side effects of sanitizers so as to develop a cautious approach while using hand sanitizers and therefore a comprehensive list of side effects of the use of hand sanitizers is given.
    


          Conclusion:

Medical emergencies on large passenger ships without doctors: the Oslo-Kiel-Oslo ferry experience,"Thor-Erik Holt, Agnar Tveten, Eilif Dahl, Thor-Erik Holt, Agnar Tveten, Eilif Dahl",2017,"Background:
        
      
      The Oslo-Kiel-Oslo route is currently the only direct ferry crossing between Norway and Germany, covered by 2 cruise-and-cars ferries carrying about 2,600 passengers each and sailing every day (20 h at sea, 4 h in port). Unlike most ocean going cruise vessels, they are not required to carry a physician but an on-board paramedic handles medical emergencies. The aim of the study was to provide data on medical emergencies leading to helicopter evacuations (helivacs) or other urgent transfers to facilities ashore from the two ferries during a 3-year period.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Data about the ferries, passengers, crew, helivacs and other medical transfers were collected from official company statistics and the paramedics' transfer reports.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 169 persons, including 14 (8.3%) crewmembers, were transferred from the ferries to land-based facilities by ambulance while alongside (n = 80; 47.3%) or evacuated by helicopter (n = 85; 50.3%) and rescue boat (n = 4; 2.4%) during the 3-year period. Transfer destinations were Denmark (n = 53), Germany (n = 49), Norway (n = 48) and Sweden (n = 19). The passenger helivac rate was 2.4 per 100,000 passenger-days. One person was airlifted from a ferry every 2 weeks. Among helivacs, 40% were heart-related, and more cardiac cases were airlifted than transferred by ambulance in port.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      All helivac requests were made after discussion between the ferry's paramedic and telemedical doctors ashore and agreement that the medical challenge exceeded the ferry's capability. This close cooperation kept the threshold for arranging helivacs from the ferries low, enabling short transport times to land-based facilities for critically ill patients. Further studies, including feedback from the receiving hospitals, are needed to determine measures that can reduce possible helicopter overutilisation without compromising patient safety and outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28952660/,2022-11-27 11:19:43 PM
SCUBA Diving in Pregnancy,"Robert L Reid, Melissa Lorenzo, Robert L Reid, Melissa Lorenzo",2018 Nov,"Objective:
        
      
      Obstetrical care providers may occasionally encounter women with questions about the safety of Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) diving in pregnancy. This article provides an overview of safety issues associated with basic SCUBA diving and offers guidance to practitioners about how to evaluate and counsel pregnant women about the associated maternal and fetal risks. Basic diving physiology is reviewed and the implications of SCUBA diving during pregnancy are discussed. A literature review examined available animal and human data about the potential adverse effects of the physiological changes of pregnancy on divers, the impact of pressure changes during diving, and possible consequences of hyperbaric gas exposure and rapid decompression on mother and fetus.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Studies were found by searching the terms ""scuba diving,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""fetus,"" ""decompression illness,"" ""hyperbaric medicine,"" and ""animal studies"" in the databases Medline, Pubmed, and Embase. Reference lists from existing articles and reports from identified diving magazines were also reviewed. Studies were limited to the English language and included publications until 2016.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      All relevant human studies were selected. Five retrospective studies and one prospective study assessing the antenatal and postnatal outcomes of women who participated in SCUBA diving while pregnant were reviewed.
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Published data was limited in both quantity and quality. The authors' experience with SCUBA diving together with a background in obstetrics allowed themes to be explored and recommendations developed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In addition to established risks of SCUBA diving, pregnant women are at increased risk due to changes in body habitus (affecting equipment fitting and balance). Animal data suggest possible adverse fetal effects due to fetal decompression illness (DCI) and hyperbaric oxygen exposure. Human data, though generally reassuring, are of poor quality and thus do not completely exclude adverse outcomes. In general, women should be cautioned to avoid diving during pregnancy, but inadvertent exposure to recreational diving in early pregnancy is not a reason for pregnancy termination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29503252/,2022-11-27 11:19:43 PM
Doppler detection in Ama divers of Japan,"Frédéric Lemaître, Kiyotaka Kohshi, Hideki Tamaki, Kasuo Nakayasu, Mesanori Harada, Masanobu Okayama, Yuka Satou, Michiko Hoshiko, Tatsuya Ishitake, Guillaume Costalat, Bernard Gardette, Frédéric Lemaître, Kiyotaka Kohshi, Hideki Tamaki, Kasuo Nakayasu, Mesanori Harada, Masanobu Okayama, Yuka Satou, Michiko Hoshiko, Tatsuya Ishitake, Guillaume Costalat, Bernard Gardette",2014 Sep,"Objective:
        
      
      Symptoms consistent with neurological decompression sickness (DCS) in commercial breath-hold (Ama) divers has been reported from a few districts of Japan. The aim of this study was to detect circulating intravascular bubbles after repetitive breath-hold diving in a local area where DCS has been reported in Ama divers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The participants were 12 partially assisted (descent using weights) male Ama divers. The equipment (AQUALAB system) consisted of continuous-wave Doppler with a 5-MHz frequency, and the Doppler probe was placed in the precordial site with the ultrasonic wave directed into the pulmonary infundibulum. We carried out continuous monitoring for 10 minutes at the end of the series of repetitive dives, and the recordings were made on numerical tracks and graded in a blind manner by 2 experienced investigators, according to the Spencer Doppler code.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Depths and number of dives were 8 to 20 m and 75 to 131 times. Mean diving duration and surface interval were 64 ± 12 seconds and 48 ± 8 seconds, respectively (mean ± SD). We detected the lowest grade of intravascular bubbles (Spencer's grade I) in an Ama diver whose mean surface interval was only 35.2 ± 6.2 seconds. His mean descending, bottom, and ascending times were 10.4 ± 1.6 seconds, 39.2 ± 8 seconds, and 18.2 ± 3.0 seconds, respectively, over the course of 99 dives.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intravascular bubbles may be formed after repetitive breath-hold dives with short surface intervals or after a long breath-holding session in Ama divers. Symptoms consistent with neurological accidents in repetitive breath-hold diving may be caused in part by the intravascular presence of bubbles, indicating the need for safety procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24882656/,2022-11-27 11:19:44 PM
Associations Between Adverse Underwater Events and ADHD Diagnosis Among Military Divers,"Charles H Van Wijk, W A J Meintjes, Charles H Van Wijk, W A J Meintjes",2021 Apr,"Objective: Adult ADHD (A-ADHD) has been associated with an increased risk of accidents and workplace injuries. ADHD within professional diving may have major potential occupational health and safety implications, as accidents underwater may have severe consequences. The study investigated any association of increased risk for adverse underwater incidents with an ADHD diagnosis. Method: This analysis used retrospective records from 156 navy divers and computed an odds ratio using cases of ADHD and cases of underwater accidents. Results: Although the odds ratio was increased, it failed to reach significance. Conclusion: We do not yet have statistical evidence suggesting that the risk for adverse underwater events is significantly increased among the ADHD group in this sample of navy divers. Sufficiently powered studies are required to further address the potential risk of A-ADHD in working divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31319735/,2022-11-27 11:19:45 PM
Physical Exercise Intensity During Submersion Selectively Affects Executive Functions,"Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Marc Dalecki, Tobias Dräger, Michael Doppelmayr, Fabian Steinberg, Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Marc Dalecki, Tobias Dräger, Michael Doppelmayr, Fabian Steinberg",2021 Mar,"Objective:
        
      
      The intact cognitive processing capacity in highly demanding and dynamically changing situations (e.g., in extreme environmental conditions) is of central relevance for personal safety. This study therefore investigated whether underwater physical exercise (PE) affected cognitive performance by comparing these effects during underwater fin-swimming as opposed to inactivity under normal environmental conditions.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Although acute bouts of PE can modulate cognitive performance under highly controlled and standardized laboratory conditions, no previous study has determined whether PE acutely modulates cognitive performance in non-laboratory testing conditions involving extreme environments (e.g., underwater).
    


          Method:
        
      
      A total of 27 healthy volunteers (16 males and 11 females; 28.9 ± 7.4 years of age) participated in two experiments involving either moderate or high PE intensity. A PRE/POST crossover design was employed among participants while performing cognitive tests in a counterbalanced order (i.e., before and after 20 min of PE in submersion [WET] and once before and after inactivity [DRY] while in the laboratory). Cognitive performance was measured as a combination of executive functions through the Eriksen Flanker (inhibition) and Two-Back (working memory) Tasks using an underwater tablet computer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ANOVAs revealed enhanced reaction times only in the Flanker test after moderate PE for the WET condition. No other effects were detected.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These findings indicate that cognitive performance is exercise-intensity-dependent with enhanced effects during moderate PE, even in extreme environments (i.e., underwater).
    


          Application:
        
      
      These results should be relevant in recreational and occupational contexts involving underwater activity and may also apply to microgravity (e.g., during extra-vehicular activities).
    


          Description:
        
      
      This study compared the acute effects of physical exercise (PE) on cognitive performance in an underwater environment while participants fin-swam with SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) gear. Findings revealed that 20 min of moderate PE positively affected cognitive performance (i.e., inhibitory control ability). However, no changes were observed after high-intensity exercise.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31596615/,2022-11-27 11:19:46 PM
Safety evaluation of carbon tetrafluoride as an inert hyperbaric breathing gas in Sprague-Dawley rats,"Matthew S Makowski, Christopher Sproul, Carol Swartz, Jeffrey I Everitt, Darin A Knaus, Jed C Wilbur, Richard E Moon, Matthew S Makowski, Christopher Sproul, Carol Swartz, Jeffrey I Everitt, Darin A Knaus, Jed C Wilbur, Richard E Moon",2022 Jun 1,"Carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) is an inert gas with higher molecular weight and lower water solubility than commonly used hyperbaric breathing gases. These inert gas properties decrease time required to decompress and avoid decompression sickness after deep dives. To assess CF4 toxicity, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 8 atm absolute (ATA) air (10 males, 10 females) or 8 ATA 79% CF4/21% O2 (25 males, 25 females). Exposures were 30 min daily for 5 days. Rat behavior was normal throughout the testing period. There were no gross or microscopic pathology abnormalities following repeat dose exposure. Male body weight trends were similar between groups. Female body weight trends were 0.5 ± 0.8% day-1 for hyperbaric air exposure and - 0.2 ± 0.8% day-1 for hyperbaric CF4 exposure (P = 0.01) but remained within literature cited norms. Organ weights and hematologic indices remained within or near literature normal ranges. Clinical chemistry panels showed no signs of toxicity in renal or hepatic biomarkers. Polychromatic erythrocyte micronucleus frequency showed no chromosomal damage. Comet assay showed no DNA damage in lung tissue. Females exposed to CF4 had 2.5 times greater percent tail DNA in liver tissue than controls (P = 0.009). However this result remained within the normal range of local negative controls. A bacterial reverse mutation assay with exposure to 1 ATA 79% CF4/21% O2 for 72 h was nonmutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium and one strain of Escherichia coli. Overall, there was no evidence that CF4 caused organ toxicity or genetic toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35429552/,2022-11-27 11:19:47 PM
Experiences of Participants During In Situ Simulation With a Learner Present,"Janatani Balakumaran, Benjamin Forestell, Krista Dowhos, Alim Nagji, Janatani Balakumaran, Benjamin Forestell, Krista Dowhos, Alim Nagji",2020 Aug 17,"Background:
        
      
      While in situ simulation (ISS) provides robust value for health care teams, it is less clear how medical learners affect the experiences of other participants.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a single-center qualitative analysis of a community hospital's emergency department ISS program that included medical learners (medical students, family and emergency medicine residents). Focus groups were conducted before and after with nurses, staff physicians, and resident physicians. Phenomenologic analysis using a constructivist framework was used to examine themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-two ISSs were held from February 2019 to March 2020. Of those simulations, 36 had learners present. Positive effects included creating an open learning environment and offering staff physicians a safe teaching space. Negative effects arose when objectives of ISS were highly team based or latent safety threat (LST) focused. All groups thought learners added value to ISS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Thought should be given to ISS objectives when considering how learners affect other participants. When including learners, review objectives, clarify expectations in prebriefing, and ensure that debriefing begins with LSTs and process objectives before diving into medical objectives. This study provides insight into the effect of medical learners on ISS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33898913/,2022-11-27 11:19:47 PM
Psycho-physiological tele-monitoring of human operators in commercial diving: The Life Support System in the SUONO project,"Marco Laurino, Lorenzo Guerriero, Paolo Allegrini, Danilo Menicucci, Francesca Mastorci, Daniele Magrin, Benedetto Allotta, Remo Bedini, Angelo Gemignani, Marco Laurino, Lorenzo Guerriero, Paolo Allegrini, Danilo Menicucci, Francesca Mastorci, Daniele Magrin, Benedetto Allotta, Remo Bedini, Angelo Gemignani",2015,"Sea-diving operations for monitoring or intervention are carried out by highly-specialized divers called Certified Commercial Divers (CCD). CCDs operate under highly demanding working conditions in extreme and hazardous environments. Every day consists of an 8 hours' shift. To avoid decompression problems the remaining 16 hours are spent in a hyperbaric environment located aboard the surface vessel or on the platform. These operating conditions require the design of a technologically-advanced device for tele-monitoring, to maximize CCDs' safety. Here we describe a proposal for monitoring and supporting CCDs during operations. We design a dedicated Life Support System (LSS), that captures real-time, vital (heart rate, respiratory rate, accelerometry, etc) and stress-related (heart-rate variability) signals from operators to transmit them to dedicated servers via telematic protocols. LSS is equipped with protocols for tele-medicine/tele-consultation.

Regular medication use by active scuba divers with a declared comorbid medical condition and victims of scuba and snorkelling-related fatalities,"Simone E Taylor, David M Taylor, Daisy Pisasale, Kyle Booth, John Lippmann, Simone E Taylor, David M Taylor, Daisy Pisasale, Kyle Booth, John Lippmann",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to describe the nature of regular medications taken by active comorbid scuba divers (having a declared medical comorbidity) and scuba divers and snorkellers who died following a diving incident.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We undertook a retrospective, observational study from July to October, 2020. Data on 268 active comorbid divers were obtained through a 2013 survey of Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific members. Data on 126 deceased scuba divers and 175 deceased snorkellers were obtained predominantly from 2001-2013 reports to Australian State Coronial Services.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The active comorbid divers were significantly older, less likely to be male, and more likely to be taking one or more medications than the two deceased subject groups (P < 0.001). Cardiovascular, endocrine and psychotropic medications accounted for 53.4%, 9.9% and 6.4% of all medications taken, respectively. Almost one tenth of the deceased divers took at least one psychotropic medication, a proportion significantly greater than the other groups (P = 0.01).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medication use among active comorbid divers is common which likely reflects their declared medical condition. Nevertheless, they appear to be diving relatively safely, often with conditions once thought to be absolute contradictions to scuba diving. The deceased divers took significantly more psychotropic medications. It is possible that their underlying psychological/psychiatric conditions rendered them more at risk of a diving incident. Increased vigilance for psychological conditions may need to be considered during diving medical examinations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547777/,2022-11-27 11:19:49 PM
Effectiveness of an adapted diving mask (Owner mask) for non-invasive ventilation in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Dulciane Nunes Paiva, Litiele Evelin Wagner, Sônia Elvira Dos Santos Marinho, Carlos Fernando Drumond Dornelles, Juliana Fernandes de Souza Barbosa, Patrícia Érika de Melo Marinho, Dulciane Nunes Paiva, Litiele Evelin Wagner, Sônia Elvira Dos Santos Marinho, Carlos Fernando Drumond Dornelles, Juliana Fernandes de Souza Barbosa, Patrícia Érika de Melo Marinho",2022 Mar 18,"Background:
        
      
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated to avoid orotracheal intubation (OTI) to reduce hospital stay and mortality. Patients infected by SARS-CoV2 can progress to respiratory failure (RF); however, in the initial phase, they can be submitted to oxygen therapy and NIV. Such resources can produce aerosol and can cause a high risk of contagion to health professionals. Safe NIV strategies are sought, and therefore, the authors adapted diving masks to be used as NIV masks (called an Owner mask).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the Owner mask safety and effectiveness regarding conventional orofacial mask for patients in respiratory failure with and without confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Brazilian multicentric study to assess patients admitted to the intensive care unit regarding their clinical, sociodemographic and anthropometric data. The primary outcome will be the rate of tracheal intubation, and secondary outcomes will include in-hospital mortality, the difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and PaCO2 levels, time in the intensive care unit and hospitalization time, adverse effects, degree of comfort and level of satisfaction of the mask use, success rate of NIV (not progressing to OTI), and behavior of the ventilatory variables obtained in NIV with an Owner mask and with a conventional face mask. Patients with COVID-19 and clinical signs indicative of RF will be submitted to NIV with an Owner mask [NIV Owner COVID Group (n = 63)] or with a conventional orofacial mask [NIV orofacial COVID Group (n = 63)], and those patients in RF due to causes not related to COVID-19 will be allocated into the NIV Owner Non-COVID Group (n = 97) or to the NIV Orofacial Non-COVID Group (n = 97) in a randomized way, which will total 383 patients, admitting 20% for loss to follow-up.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This is the first randomized and controlled trial during the COVID-19 pandemic about the safety and effectiveness of the Owner mask compared to the conventional orofacial mask. Experimental studies have shown that the Owner mask enables adequate sealing on the patient's face and the present study is relevant as it aims to minimize the aerosolization of the virus in the environment and improve the safety of health professionals.

Estimating Inert Gas Bubbling from Simple SCUBA Diving Parameters,"Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch, Andreas Fichtner, Benedikt Brunner, Thomas Pohl, Thomas Grab, Tobias Fieback, Thea Koch",2021 Jul,"Inert gas bubbles frequently occur in SCUBA divers' vascular systems, eventually leading to decompression accidents. Only in professional settings, dive profiles can be adjusted on individual basis depending on bubble grades detected through ultrasonography. A total of 342 open-circuit air dives following sports diving profiles were assessed using echocardiography. Subsequently, (Eftedal-Brubakk) bubble grades were correlated with dive and individual parameters. Post-dive cardiac bubbles were observed in 47% of all dives and bubble grades were significantly correlated with depth (r=0.46), air consumption (r=0.41), age (r=0.25), dive time (r=0.23), decompression diving (r=0.19), surface time (r=- 0.12). Eftedal-Brubakk categorical bubble grades for sports diving with compressed air can be approximated by bubble grade = (age*50-1 - surface time*150-1+maximum depth*45-1+air consumption*4500-1)2 (units in years, hours, meter, and bar*liter; R2=0.31). Thus, simple dive and individual parameters allow reasonable estimation of especially relevant medium to higher bubble grades for information on relevant decompression stress after ascent. Echo bubble grade 0 is overestimated by the formula derived. However, echo might fail to detect minor bubbling only. The categorical prediction of individual decompression stress with simple bio and dive data should be evaluated further to be developed towards dive computer included automatic ex-post information for decision-making on individual safety measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33506443/,2022-11-27 11:19:50 PM
Cardiovascular changes during SCUBA diving: an underwater Doppler echocardiographic study,"C Marabotti, A Scalzini, D Menicucci, M Passera, R Bedini, A L'Abbate, C Marabotti, A Scalzini, D Menicucci, M Passera, R Bedini, A L'Abbate",2013 Sep,"Aim:
        
      
      Body immersion induces blood redistribution (from peripheral to intrathoracic vessels) and is a powerful autonomic stimulus (activating both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems). For these reasons, concerns have been raised about the safety of diving for subjects with previous heart disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular changes occurring during recreational SCUBA diving, as assessed by underwater Doppler echocardiography.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eighteen healthy experienced divers underwent a 2D Doppler echocardiography basally, during two 15' steps of still SCUBA diving at different depths (10 m followed by 5 m) and shortly after the end of immersion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During dive, left ventricular (LV) diastolic volume and early left ventricular filling significantly increased (5 m vs. basal: P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), while both deceleration time of the early filling rate and late diastolic filling velocity significantly decreased (5 m and 10 m dive vs. basal: P < 0.01). LV volume increase and diastolic filling changes persisted at postdive evaluation, where a significant decrease in heart rate was also observed (P < 0.01 as compared to basal, 5-m and 10-m dive).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study documents that shallow-depth SCUBA diving induces LV enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. Direct underwater evaluation by Doppler echocardiography could be an appropriate tool for unmasking subjects at risk for underwater-related accidents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23638629/,2022-11-27 11:19:51 PM
The incidence of decompression illness in 10 years of scientific diving,"Michael R Dardeau, Neal W Pollock, Christian M McDonald, Michael A Lang, Michael R Dardeau, Neal W Pollock, Christian M McDonald, Michael A Lang",2012 Dec,"Background:
        
      
      The American Academy of Underwater Science (AAUS) constitutes the single largest pool of organizations with scientific diving programmes in North America. Members submit annual summaries of diving activity and any related incidents.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All diving records for a 10-year period between January 1998 and December 2007 were reviewed. Incidents were independently classified or reclassified by a four-person panel with expertise in scientific diving and diving safety using a previously published protocol. Subsequent panel discussion produced a single consensus classification of each case.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 95 confirmed incidents were reported in conjunction with 1,019,159 scientific dives, yielding an overall incidence of 0.93/10,000 person-dives. A total of 33 cases were determined to involve decompression illness (DCI), encompassing both decompression sickness and air embolism. The incidence of DCI was 0.324/10,000 person-dives, substantially lower than the rates of 0.9-35.3/10,000 published for recreational, instructional/guided, commercial and/or military diving.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Scientific diving safety may be facilitated by a combination of relatively high levels of training and oversight, the predominance of shallow, no-decompression diving and, possibly, low pressure to complete dives under less than optimal circumstances.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23258455/,2022-11-27 11:19:52 PM
Monoplace chamber treatment of decompression illness: Review and commentary,"Richard Clarke, Richard Clarke",2020 Sep 30,"This paper summarises the history and capabilities of monoplace chambers in treatment of decompression illness (DCI); both in support of diving operations and in the hospital setting. In the field, monoplace hyperbaric chambers provide victims of DCI immediate access to recompression in settings where traditional multiplace chambers are not available. Alternatively, they may facilitate pressurised transport to a multiplace chamber for continued management. Recently, collapsible lightweight versions have improved suitability for field deployment aboard small vessels in remote settings, and for use by less technically capable military, occupational and civilian operators. The resulting elimination of treatment delays may prove lifesaving and central nervous system sparing, and avoid subsequent diving fitness disqualification. Monoplace chambers thus facilitate diving operations that would otherwise be difficult to condone on health and safety grounds. The 1960s saw the introduction of multiplace hyperbaric chambers into the hospital setting, as a number of non-diving conditions appeared to benefit from hyperbaric oxygen. This coincided with interest in hyperbaric oxygen as a solid tumour radiation sensitiser. Development of a novel acrylic-hulled single occupancy chamber enabled patients to undergo radiotherapy while pressurised within its oxygen atmosphere. Increasing numbers of health care facilities adopted this chamber type as a more economical, less complex alternative to the multiplace chamber. Incorporation of relevant biomedical technologies have allowed monoplace chambers to support increasingly complex patients in a safe, effective manner. Despite these advances, criticism of medical centre-based monoplace chamber treatment of DCI exists. This paper evaluates this controversy and presents relevant counter-arguments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32957129/,2022-11-27 11:19:53 PM
Sink or swim: innovations in aquatic health,"Lee Hill, Margo Mountjoy, James Miller, Jamie Burr, Lee Hill, Margo Mountjoy, James Miller, Jamie Burr",2021 Aug,"Since the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, the aquatic sports have expanded both in participation and innovation over the last century. Beginning with swimming, diving, water polo, and later additions of artistic swimming, open water swimming and high diving, the aquatics sports represent a core pillar of Olympic disciplines. The rapid expansion of aquatic disciplines necessitated the foundation of the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) in 1908, to govern the development of aquatic sports. The amateur spectacle has been slowly replaced with an increased focus on health and performance by dedicated professional athletes and support teams, resulting in the development of new innovations. In the early years, innovations largely centered on technical equipment such as bathing suit and springboard design. In more recent years, research and innovation have shifted focus to health and its impact on performance, including but not limited to changes in training methods, nutrition, injury and illness reduction through surveillance and access to education for athletes, coaches, and support personnel. An increased awareness on factors that affect athlete health have also driven safety innovations including the development of Nutrition and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport Clinical Assessment Tool, the Sport Mental Health Assessment and Recognition Tools and safeguarding from harassment and abuse through embedding athletes' right to safe sport in underpinning statutory documents. While the future of aquatic health innovations remains undefined, there are many potential opportunities for research and knowledge translation as the aquatic sports continue to evolve and adapt over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34137575/,2022-11-27 11:19:54 PM
Advances in the treatment of neuropathic pain with hyperbaric oxygen,"Yan-Yan Zhou, Rong-Rong Ren, Yi Cen, Wen-Wu Liu, Hui Chen, Yan-Yan Zhou, Rong-Rong Ren, Yi Cen, Wen-Wu Liu, Hui Chen",2021 First Quarter,"Neuropathic pain (NPP) refers to the pain caused by primary or secondary injury or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, and usually requires multidisciplinary treatment. However, most pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can only temporarily and/or moderately improve pain-related symptoms, and they often produce unbearable adverse reactions or cause drug resistance. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy has been widely used in the clinical treatment of some diseases due to its advantages of safety, few side effects, no resistance, and non-invasiveness. In recent years, increasing numbers of basic and clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of HBO2 in the treatment of NPP, and great progress has been made in this field.

          Patient:
        
      
      This is a case report of a patient who underwent successful cochlear implantation with postoperative preservation of residual low-frequency hearing.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      20 scuba dives up to depths of 92 feet (3.8 atmospheres absolute).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Audiometric testing both before and after scuba shows no change in hearing thresholds. The internal receiver-stimulator of the cochlear implant was unaffected by prolonged and repeated pressures up to approximately 3.8 atmospheres absolute. The patient had no adverse middle ear effects during or after the dives, and no evidence of inner ear barotrauma or decompression sickness as a result of the elevated pressures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first report of preserved hearing after cochlear implantation being maintained following scuba diving, and corroborates previous literature showing that exposure to increased pressures with a cochlear implant in situ is safe without adverse effects on the implant hardware or software. Scuba diving appears safe not only with cochlear implants but also in patients with residual hearing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30028923/,2022-11-27 11:19:55 PM
Drug-induced long QT syndrome increases the risk of drowning,"Frank F Vincenzi, Frank F Vincenzi",2016 Feb,"There is strong evidence linking inherited long QT syndromes with an increased risk of drowning due to fatal arrhythmias in the water. Drug-induced long QT syndrome (DILQTS) is hypothesized to increase the risk of drowning by similar mechanisms. It is suggested that QT prolongation caused by a drug or drugs, when combined with the autonomic conflict associated with the mammalian dive reflex and/or the cold shock reflex, sets up conditions that may result in a sudden fatal arrhythmia while in water - thus an increased risk of drowning related to a drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval. Many widely used drugs prolong the QT interval thus raising a drug safety issue that needs confirmation or refutation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26826633/,2022-11-27 11:19:56 PM
Mechanism of injury and special considerations as predictive of serious injury: A systematic review,"Joshua R Lupton, Cynthia Davis-O'Reilly, Rebecca M Jungbauer, Craig D Newgard, Mary E Fallat, Joshua B Brown, N Clay Mann, Gregory J Jurkovich, Eileen Bulger, Mark L Gestring, E Brooke Lerner, Roger Chou, Annette M Totten, Joshua R Lupton, Cynthia Davis-O'Reilly, Rebecca M Jungbauer, Craig D Newgard, Mary E Fallat, Joshua B Brown, N Clay Mann, Gregory J Jurkovich, Eileen Bulger, Mark L Gestring, E Brooke Lerner, Roger Chou, Annette M Totten",2022 Sep,"Objectives:
        
      
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's field triage guidelines (FTG) are routinely used by emergency medical services personnel for triaging injured patients. The most recent (2011) FTG contains physiologic, anatomic, mechanism, and special consideration steps. Our objective was to systematically review the criteria in the mechanism and special consideration steps that might be predictive of serious injury or need for a trauma center.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review of the predictive utility of mechanism and special consideration criteria for predicting serious injury. A research librarian searched in Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases for studies published between January 2011 and February 2021. Eligible studies were identified using a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were excluded if they lacked an outcome for serious injury, such as measures of resource use, injury severity scores, mortality, or composite measures using a combination of outcomes. Given the heterogeneity in populations, measures, and outcomes, results were synthesized qualitatively focusing on positive likelihood ratios (LR+) whenever these could be calculated from presented data or adjusted odds ratios (aOR).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We reviewed 2418 abstracts and 315 full-text publications and identified 42 relevant studies. The factors most predictive of serious injury across multiple studies were death in the same vehicle (LR+ 2.2-7.4), ejection (aOR 3.2-266.2), extrication (LR+ 1.1-6.6), lack of seat belt use (aOR 4.4-11.3), high speeds (aOR 2.0-2.9), concerning crash variables identified by vehicle telemetry systems (LR+ 4.7-22.2), falls from height (LR+ 2.4-5.9), and axial load or diving (aOR 2.5-17.6). Minor or inconsistent predictors of serious injury were vehicle intrusion (LR+ 0.8-7.2), cardiopulmonary or neurologic comorbidities (LR+ 0.8-3.1), older age (LR+ 0.6-6.8), or anticoagulant use (LR+ 1.1-1.8).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Select mechanism and special consideration criteria contribute positively to appropriate field triage of potentially injured patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35319149/,2022-11-27 11:19:57 PM
Large-scale helicopter rescue of cruise passengers and freighter crew off the coast of Norway in stormy weather,"Eilif Dahl, Eilif Dahl",2019,"During a storm on the 23rd of March 2019, southbound Viking Sky was crossing the notorious Hustadvika bay off Norway with 1373 (915 passengers, 458 crew) aboard when power was lost and the ship drifted towards the shore.

"Dromosagnosia, or why some people lose their sense of direction while driving","Wei-Shih Tseng, Nian-Sheng Tzeng, Wei-Shih Tseng, Nian-Sheng Tzeng",2013 Nov,"We coined a new word, ""dromosagnosia"", from the Greek words, dromos (""way, road"")+agnosia, to describe the loss of direction while driving, an orientation disorder similar to but different from pure topographic disorientation. Historically, human beings have moved more quickly, from using domesticated animals to high speed vehicles, and this may be beyond the brain's ability to react. Without the benefit of an automatic navigation system, automobiles are associated with more problems of dromosagnosia than are fast-moving aircraft or ships. Previous studies have noted that some areas of the brain are associated with spatial orientation, spatial memory, and even emotion, and abnormalities there could exacerbate the loss of sense of direction. We hypothesize that some people are especially disadvantaged from these brain differences and emotional disturbances when driving their cars. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) studies combined with a virtual reality driving simulation might be used to find the areas of the brain related to dromosagnosia. Future applications: some people with dromosagnosia might benefit from special remedial training and a driving safety support system to avoid potential problems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24080204/,2022-11-27 11:19:58 PM
Evidence for the initiation of decompression sickness by exposure to intense underwater sound,"Dror Tal, Hofit Shachar-Bener, Dov Hershkovitz, Yehuda Arieli, Avi Shupak, Dror Tal, Hofit Shachar-Bener, Dov Hershkovitz, Yehuda Arieli, Avi Shupak",2015 Sep,"Mass stranding of cetaceans (whales and dolphins), in close association with the activity of naval sonar systems, has been reported on numerous occasions. Necropsy showed bubble-associated lesions similar to those described in human decompression sickness (DCS). We examined the hypothesis that exposure to underwater sound may potentiate DCS. Rats were subjected to immersion and simulated dives with and without simultaneous acoustic transmissions at pressure levels and frequencies of 204 dB/8 kHz and 183.3 dB/15 kHz. DCS severity was assessed using the rotating wheel method. Recording of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) was employed under general anesthesia as an electrophysiological measure of neurologic insult. A significantly higher rate of decompression sickness was found among animals exposed to the 204-dB/8-kHz sound field. Significantly higher pathological SSEPs scores were noted for both underwater sound protocols. Pathological SSEPs scores in animals immersed during the acoustic transmissions, but without changes in ambient pressure, were comparable to those observed in animals exposed to the dive profile. The results demonstrate induction of neurological damage by intense underwater sound during immersion, with a further deleterious effect when this was combined with decompression stress. The study outcome has potential implications for human diving safety and may provide an explanation for the mass stranding of cetaceans purportedly associated with sonar activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26133802/,2022-11-27 11:19:59 PM
Sudden Unexpected Death and the Mammalian Dive Response: Catastrophic Failure of a Complex Tightly Coupled System,"Frank F Vincenzi, Frank F Vincenzi",2019 Feb 19,"In tightly coupled complex systems, when two or more factors or events interact in unanticipated ways, catastrophic failures of high-risk technical systems happen rarely, but quickly. Safety features are commonly built into complex systems to avoid disasters but are often part of the problem. The human body may be considered as a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure (sudden unexpected death, SUD) when certain factors or events interact. The mammalian dive response (MDR) is a built-in safety feature of the body that normally conserves oxygen during acute hypoxia. Activation of the MDR is the final pathway to sudden cardiac (SCD) in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and sudden cardiac death in water (SCDIW, fatal drowning). There is no single cause in any of these death scenarios, but an array of, unanticipated, often unknown, factors or events that activate or interact with the mammalian dive reflex. In any particular case, the relevant risk factors or events might include a combination of genetic, developmental, metabolic, disease, environmental, or operational influences. Determination of a single cause in any of these death scenarios is unlikely. The common thread among these seemingly different death scenarios is activation of the mammalian dive response. The human body is a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure when that ""safety feature"" is activated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30886584/,2022-11-27 11:20:00 PM

Despite the hardness, size, tablet shape (oval, disc, capsule), all of them passed the splitting test except for the disc shape which showed %RSD higher than 6%. However, hardness and the coating had a generally positive trend on tablet breaking since they gave low% RSD. These findings suggest that the disc shape particle is not suitable for breaking.

Safety Priorities and Underestimations in Recreational Scuba Diving Operations: A European Study Supporting the Implementation of New Risk Management Programmes,"Serena Lucrezi, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Francois Burman, Tamer Ozyigit, Danilo Cialoni, Guy Thomas, Alessandro Marroni, Melville Saayman, Serena Lucrezi, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Francois Burman, Tamer Ozyigit, Danilo Cialoni, Guy Thomas, Alessandro Marroni, Melville Saayman",2018 Mar 23,"Introduction: Scuba diving is an important marine tourism sector, but requires proper safety standards to reduce the risks and increase accessibility to its market. To achieve safety goals, safety awareness and positive safety attitudes in recreational scuba diving operations are essential. However, there is no published research exclusively focusing on scuba divers' and dive centres' perceptions toward safety. This study assessed safety perceptions in recreational scuba diving operations, with the aim to inform and enhance safety and risk management programmes within the scuba diving tourism industry. Materials and Methods: Two structured questionnaire surveys were prepared by the organisation Divers Alert Network and administered online to scuba diving operators in Italy and scuba divers in Europe, using a mixture of convenience and snowball sampling. Questions in the survey included experience and safety offered at the dive centre; the buddy system; equipment and accessories for safe diving activities; safety issues in the certification of new scuba divers; incidents/accidents; and attitudes toward safety. Results: 91 scuba diving centres and 3,766 scuba divers participated in the study. Scuba divers gave importance to safety and the responsiveness of service providers, here represented by the dive centres. However, they underestimated the importance of a personal emergency action/assistance plan and, partly, of the buddy system alongside other safety procedures. Scuba divers agreed that some risks, such as those associated with running out of gas, deserve attention. Dive centres gave importance to aspects such as training and emergency action/assistance plans. However, they were limitedly involved in safety campaigning. Dive centres' perceptions of safety in part aligned with those of scuba divers, with some exceptions. Conclusion: Greater responsibility is required in raising awareness and educating scuba divers, through participation in prevention campaigns and training. The study supports the introduction of programmes aiming to create a culture of safety among dive centres and scuba divers. Two examples, which are described in this paper, include the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment protocol for dive centres and scuba divers, and the Diving Safety Officer programme to create awareness, improve risk management, and mitigate health and safety risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29628904/,2022-11-27 11:20:01 PM
International travelers and unintentional fatal drowning in Australia--a 10 year review 2002-12,"Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat, Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat",2016 Feb 15,"Introduction:
        
      
      . Drowning deaths of travelers are commonly reported in the media, creating a perception that they are at a higher risk of drowning than residents. This may be true, due in part to unfamiliarity with the risks posed by the hazard, however there is limited information about drowning deaths of travelers in Australia. This study aims to identify the incidence of drowning among international travelers in Australia and examine the risk factors to inform prevention strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      . Data on unintentional fatal drowning in Australian waterways of victims with a residential postcode from outside Australia were extracted from the Royal Life Saving Society-Australia National Fatal Drowning Database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      . Between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2012 drowning deaths among people known to be international travelers accounted for 4.3% (N = 123) of the 2870 drowning deaths reported in Australian waterways. Key locations for drowning deaths included beaches (39.0%), ocean/harbour (22.0%) and swimming pools (12.2%). Leading activities prior to drowning included swimming (52.0%), diving (17.9%) and watercraft incidents (13.0%).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      . International travelers pose a unique challenge from a drowning prevention perspective. The ability to exchange information on water safety is complicated due to potential language barriers, possible differences in swimming ability, different attitudes to safety in the traveler's home country and culture, a lack of opportunities to discuss safety, a relaxed attitude to safety which may result in an increase in risk taking behaviour and alcohol consumption.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      . Prevention is vital both to reduce loss of life in the aquatic environment and promote Australia as a safe and enjoyable holiday destination for international travelers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26883927/,2022-11-27 11:20:02 PM

          Methods:
        
      
      In this prospective, double-blind, open-water study, 108 advanced divers (38 females) were randomized to an air or a nitrox-group for a 60-min dive to 24 m salt water. Breathing gas effects on cognitive performance were assessed during the dive using a short- and long-term memory test and a number connection test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nitrox28 divers made fewer mistakes only on the long-term memory test (p = 0.038). Female divers remembered more items than male divers (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the number connection test between the groups.
    


          Conclusion:

Psychological considerations in submarine escape training: brief overview and future directions,"Charles H Van Wijk, Charles H Van Wijk",2017,"The inability of a submarine to surface must rate as one of greatest risks to sailors in peacetime. To prepare for such emergencies, many navies provide training to master the procedures required to escape successfully from disabled submarines.

It further discusses applicable psychological constructs such as positive outcome expectancies, the role of anxiety, and other personal factors mediating outcomes of such training. It concludes with recommendations for future research aimed at enhancing the safety and impact of submarine escape training. These include enhanced detection of psychological risk factors such as anxiety, as well as investigating the relative contribution of personality variables to in-training safety and positive outcome expectancies. These recommendations do not only apply to submarine escape training, but may also be applicable to high fidelity safety training in other off-shore survival contexts, such as helicopter underwater escape training, freefall lifeboat training and smoke diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28952663/,2022-11-27 11:20:04 PM

      During descent in freediving there is exposure to rapidly increasing pressure. Inability to quickly equalise middle ear pressure may cause trauma to the ear. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of pressure-related damage to the middle ear and the Eustachian tube during freediving and to identify possible risk factors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixteen free divers performed diving sessions in an indoor pool 20 metres' freshwater (mfw) deep. During each session, each diver performed four own free dives and up to four safety dives. Naso- and oto-endoscopy and Eustachian tube function tests were performed on the right and left ears before diving, between each session and after the last session. The otoscopic findings were classified according to the Teed classification (0 = normal tympanic membrane to 4 = perforation). Additionally, ENT-related complaints were assessed using a questionnaire.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants performed 317 dives (on average 20 dives per diver, six per session). The average depth was 13.3 mfw. Pressure-related changes (Teed 1 and 2) were detected in 48 % of ears. Teed level increased significantly with an increasing number of completed sessions (P < 0.0001). Higher pressure-related damage (Teed 2) occurred in less experienced divers, was associated with significantly lower peak pressures in the middle ear and led to more ear-related symptoms. A preference for the Frenzel technique for middle ear pressure equalisation during freediving was shown.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pressure exposure during freediving had a cumulative effect on the middle ear. Factors such as diving depth, diving experience and number of diving sessions correlated with the occurrence of higher Teed levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325015/,2022-11-27 11:20:04 PM
Staffing and training issues in critical care hyperbaric medicine,"Jacek Kot, Jacek Kot",2015 Mar,"The integrated chain of treatment of the most severe clinical cases that require hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) assumes that intensive care is continued while inside the hyperbaric chamber. Such an approach needs to take into account all the risks associated with transportation of the critically ill patient from the ICU to the chamber and back, changing of ventilator circuits and intravascular lines, using different medical devices in a hyperbaric environment, advanced invasive physiological monitoring as well as medical procedures (infusions, drainage, etc) during long or frequently repeated HBOT sessions. Any medical staff who take care of critically ill patients during HBOT should be certified and trained according to both emergency/intensive care and hyperbaric requirements. For any HBOT session, the number of staff needed for any HBOT session depends on both the type of chamber and the patient's status--stable, demanding or critically ill. For a critically ill patient, the standard procedure is a one-to-one patient-staff ratio inside the chamber; however, the final decision whether this is enough is taken after careful risk assessment based on the patient's condition, clinical indication for HBOT, experience of the personnel involved in that treatment and the available equipment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25964039/,2022-11-27 11:20:05 PM

DCS is a major problem among fishermen divers worldwide. This paper explores how diving behavior and fishing techniques among fishermen relate to the probability of experiencing DCS (Pdcs). Fieldwork was conducted in two communities during the 2012-2013 fishing season. Fishermen were classified into three groups (two per group) according to their fishing performance and followed during their journeys. Dive profiles were recorded using Sensus Ultra dive recorders (Reefet Inc.). Surveys were used to record fishing yields from cooperative and individual fishermen along with fishing techniques and dive behavior. 120 dives were recorded. Fishermen averaged three dives/day, with an average depth of 47 ± 2 feet of sea water (fsw) and an average total bottom time (TBT) of 95 ± 11 minutes. 24% of dives exceeded the 2008 U.S. Navy no-decompression limit. The average ascent rate was 20 fsw/minute, and 5% of those exceeded 40 fsw/minute. Inadequate decompression was observed in all fishermen. Fishermen are diving outside the safety limits of both military and recreational standards. Fishing techniques and dive behavior were important factors in Pdcs.

Hydrodisplacement of sural nerve for safety and efficacy of endovenous thermal ablation for small saphenous vein incompetence,"Omar Rodriguez-Acevedo, Kristen E Elstner, Kui Martinic, Aaron Zea, Jenny Diaz, Rodrigo T Martins, Fernando Arduini, Alexandra Hodgkinson, Nabeel Ibrahim, Omar Rodriguez-Acevedo, Kristen E Elstner, Kui Martinic, Aaron Zea, Jenny Diaz, Rodrigo T Martins, Fernando Arduini, Alexandra Hodgkinson, Nabeel Ibrahim",2017 Aug,"Background Endovenous radio frequency ablation for small saphenous vein incompetence by and large appears to be superior and safer than conventional open surgery. Small saphenous vein ablation from approximately mid-calf to the point proximally where the small saphenous vein dives into the popliteal fossa is considered to be safe, as the sural nerve is in most cases separated from this segment of the small saphenous vein by the deep fascia. The outcome of the distal incompetent small saphenous vein remains unclear. Efficacy of the endovenous radio frequency ablation can be enhanced by increasing the length of the ablatable small saphenous vein segment. Methodology To optimise endovenous radio frequency ablation outcome, the distal small saphenous vein may be made amenable to ablation if safety of the sural nerve can be assured. The sural nerve was successfully located using duplex ultrasound in 100% of our cohort in this study. The standard entry point for venous access was just above the lateral malleolus. After introduction of the introducer sheath, the radio frequency catheter was advanced proximally; the sural nerve was displaced from the small saphenous vein by approximately 1 cm with the administration of tumescent anaesthesia ( hydrodisplacement). A total of 118 patients underwent extended endovenous radio frequency ablation of 124 incompetent small saphenous vein trunks using the method described. Results Successful extended ablation of the small saphenous vein was achieved in 100% of cases and it was confirmed by duplex scanning at one and six weeks. Two neurological events were recorded during the study: 1. One patient with temporary foot drop lasting for less than 6 h with complete recovery. 2. A second patient with a sural nerve sensory deficit reported by the patient at day 2-3, which remains current at six weeks. Conclusions Extended endovenous radio frequency ablation of the small saphenous vein to optimise length of the ablatable vein segment is feasible with careful identification and hydrodisplacement of the sural nerve.

      For this living systematic review update the previously published search strategy (excluding Google Scholar) was adopted with an extension from 01 February 2021 to 01 April 2022. Study inclusion criteria, data extraction, risk of bias estimation and dispute resolution methods were repeated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two new studies enrolling 127 patients were included in this update, taking the total to eight studies with 224 patients. Both new studies were randomised controlled trials, one at moderate and one at high risk of bias. Across these eight studies, 114 patients were treated with HBOT. All reported improved clinical outcomes without observation of any serious adverse events. Meta-analysis remained unjustified given the high heterogeneity between studies and incomplete reporting.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This updated living systematic review provides further evidence on the safety and effectiveness of HBOT to treat acute hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732285/,2022-11-27 11:20:08 PM
Wearable Devices in Diving: Scoping Review,"Benjamin Bube, Bruno Baruque Zanón, Ana María Lara Palma, Heinrich Klocke, Benjamin Bube, Bruno Baruque Zanón, Ana María Lara Palma, Heinrich Klocke",2022 Sep 6,"Background:
        
      
      Wearables and their benefits for the safety and well-being of users have been widely studied and have had an enormous impact on the general development of these kinds of devices. Yet, the extent of research into the use and impact of wearable devices in the underwater environment is comparatively low. In the past 15 years, there has been an increased interest in research into wearables that are used underwater, as the use of such wearables has steadily grown over time. However, there has so far been no clear indication in the literature about the direction in which efforts for the design and construction of underwater wearable devices are developing. Therefore, the analysis presented in this scoping review establishes a good and powerful basis for the further development and orientation of current underwater wearables within the field.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      In this scoping review, we targeted wearable devices for underwater use to make a comprehensive map of their capabilities and features and discuss the general direction of the development of underwater wearables and the orientation of research into novel prototypes of these kinds of devices.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In September 2021, we conducted an extensive search for existing literature on 4 databases and for grey literature to identify developed prototypes and early-stage products that were described and tested in water, could be worn and interacted with (eg, displays, buttons, etc), and were fully functional without external equipment. The studies were written in English, came from peer-reviewed academic sources, and were published between 2005 and 2021. We reviewed each title and abstract. The data extraction process was carried out by one author and verified by another author.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 36 relevant studies were included. Among these, 4 different categories were identified; 18 studies dealt primarily with safety devices, 9 dealt with underwater communication devices, 7 dealt with head-up displays, and 2 dealt with underwater human-computer interaction approaches. Although the safety devices seemed to have gained the most interest at the time of this study, a clear trend toward underwater communication wearables was identified.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review sought to provide a first insight into the possibilities and challenges of the technologies that have been used in and for wearable devices that are meant for use in the underwater environment. Among these, underwater communication technologies have had the most significant influence on future developments. Moreover, a topic that has not received enough attention but should be further addressed is human-computer interaction. By developing underwater wearables that cover 2 or more of the technology categories that we identified, the extent of the benefits of such devices can be significantly increased in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36066926/,2022-11-27 11:20:09 PM
Can patients with a CSF shunt SCUBA dive?,"Dmitri Shastin, Malik Zaben, Paul Leach, Dmitri Shastin, Malik Zaben, Paul Leach",2016 Jul,"Background:
        
      
      Shunt placement for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is one of the most commonly performed procedures in neurosurgery. Pleasure or sports diving is a popular sport enjoyed by millions. At present, no guidelines exist to affirm the safety of diving in the presence of a CSF shunt.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature search and review of medical fitness regulations used by diving organisations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Although the available evidence is anecdotal, no reports of shunt-related complications exist and in vitro studies show lasting functionality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with CSF shunts should undergo careful evaluation including assessment of their cognitive and physical needs as well as co-morbidities. Having a CSF shunt in situ is not in itself a contraindication to SCUBA diving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27084379/,2022-11-27 11:20:10 PM
Cardiovascular considerations for scuba divers,"Jason V Tso, Joshua M Powers, Jonathan H Kim, Jason V Tso, Joshua M Powers, Jonathan H Kim",2022 Jun 24,"As the popularity of scuba diving increases internationally, physicians interacting with divers in the clinical setting must be familiar with the cardiovascular stresses and risks inherent to this activity. Scuba presents a formidable cardiovascular challenge by combining unique environmental conditions with the physiologic demands of underwater exercise. Haemodynamic stresses encountered at depth include increased hydrostatic pressure leading to central shifts in plasma volume coupled with cold water stimuli leading to simultaneous parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic responses. Among older divers and those with underlying cardiovascular risk factors, these physiologic changes increase acute cardiac risks while diving. Additional scuba risks, as a consequence of physical gas laws, include arterial gas emboli and decompression sickness. These pathologies are particularly dangerous with altered sensorium in hostile dive conditions. When present, the appropriate management of patent foramen ovale (PFO) is uncertain, but closure of PFO may reduce the risk of paradoxical gas embolism in divers with a prior history of decompression sickness. Finally, similar to other Masters-level athletes, divers with underlying traditional cardiovascular risk should undergo complete cardiac risk stratification to determine 'fitness-to-dive'. The presence of undertreated coronary artery disease, occult cardiomyopathy, channelopathy and arrhythmias must all be investigated and appropriately treated in order to ensure diver safety. A patient-centred approach facilitating shared decision-making between divers and experienced practitioners should be utilised in the management of prospective scuba divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34670825/,2022-11-27 11:20:10 PM
Occupational Safety and Health in a Community of Shellfish Divers: A Community-Based Participatory Approach,"Marie A Garrido, Manuel Parra, Juana Díaz, Julia Medel, Dennis Nowak, Katja Radon, Marie A Garrido, Manuel Parra, Juana Díaz, Julia Medel, Dennis Nowak, Katja Radon",2020 Jun,"In artisanal fishing communities in Chile, the access to occupational safety and health (OSH) is limited by factors such as the informality of employment. Our objective was to analyze the working and health conditions of workers in a coastal town in Southern Chile, under a community-based participatory approach. We carried out two independent social dialogue workshops within the community. The first one (N of participants = 25) was aimed to identify the strengths, weaknesses and challenges for preventing decompression sickness among divers. The second workshop (N of participants = 10) was set to identify the work processes and to map the occupational risks during seafood harvesting and processing in the community. Community members' training for handling and preventing decompression sickness among divers, and the collaboration between a local health representative, stakeholders and authorities, were identified as contributing factors in reducing fatalities and sequels among divers in the past. Technology and safety on board the vessels, training of healthcare personnel in OSH, and access to health programs, were identified as remaining challenges. Through risk mapping, the participants identified the relationship between working and health conditions in the community, reinforcing the necessity of improving access to health and social security. The community participation in identifying and analyzing working and health conditions could be the first step for a strategy to address OSH through primary health care in rural communities. Community empowerment and involvement in action plans, training on basic OSH for health care workers, and public policies are required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31728798/,2022-11-27 11:20:11 PM
Breathing through a diving snorkel; theory and experiment of air flow resistance and cost of breathing,"N A M Schellart, N A M Schellart",2021 First Quarter,"The snorkel allows a surface swimmer to observe the underwater world through the face mask without being disturbed by inhaling. The effect of a snorkel on breathing resistance and cost is widely held to be substantial. This study aims to model these parameters and to measure indirectly the actual increases. Further, resistances of differing designs and dimensions were assessed and recommendations were made concerning use and choice. Maximal voluntary ventilation in 12 seconds (MVV12) was measured in 19 volunteers seated on dry land with and without a classic J-type snorkel (inner diameter 20.5 mm). The extra and total resistances and costs were calculated using the MVV12 data and using estimated airways resistance extrapolated from subject's demography and spirometric literature data. MVV12 measurements with snorkel showed a minute volume of 152 ±38 L∙min-1, 6.0 ±3.7% lower than without snorkel (p = 7.0x10-6). The theoretical MVV12, calculated from snorkel and airways resistances, decreased by 3.2%. Experimental total breathing resistance (457±83 Pa∙s∙L-1) was 6.5 ± 3.2% higher than without snorkel (p = 2.6x10-7), but the total mechanical breathing cost was unaffected by the snorkel (13.58 Watts with; 13.64 Watts without). Divers' estimations of resistance increase were exaggerated (8.8% at rest, 23% swimming). Classical J-type snorkels with an inner diameter ≥19.5 mm add 3-16% resistance . There is no risk of hypercapnia. Scuba divers are recommended to use their snorkel to breathe more comfortably on the surface. It is recommended the snorkel be made a mandatory safety accessory. The best multipurpose snorkel (19-21 mm) has no top appendages and no water release valve.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33648037/,2022-11-27 11:20:12 PM
Self-reported exercise behaviour and perception of its importance to recreational divers,"Christopher R Kovacs, Peter Buzzacott, Christopher R Kovacs, Peter Buzzacott",2017,"Background:
        
      
      This study examined self-reported physical activity and perceptions of exercise importance among certified divers in two distinct age groups.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Questionnaires were distributed by hand at dive sites in three states of the United States, half to students from an academic programme in scuba diving at a regional university. The survey included questions about health status, dive history, certification levels, structured exercise activity levels and perceived importance of regular exercise to their health, diving ability, and safety. Also included was the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, a validated physical activity classification instrument for use among adults.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Non-students were older than the students and had greater diving experience. There was no detectable difference between groups in perceived exercise importance to health (p = 0.69), diving ability (p = 0.75), or diving safety (p = 0.25). Fitting age, sex, occupation and number of dives to a generalised linear model to predict Godin-Shephard scores, number of dives was removed first (p = 0.43), followed by student status (p = 0.33). Remaining predictors of Godin-Shephard exercise scores were age (-0.004 per year, p < 0.0001) and sex (males = + 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.17, p = 0.0012). Both groups reported similar structured exercise regularity, overall health and perceived importance of regular exercise for health, diving and safety.

A case-control questionnaire survey of decompression sickness risk in Okinawa divers,"Naoko Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita, Mitsuhiro Enomoto, Yasushi Kojima, Takuya Oyaizu, Masaharu Shibayama, Kazuo Yamamoto, Naoko Suzuki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita, Mitsuhiro Enomoto, Yasushi Kojima, Takuya Oyaizu, Masaharu Shibayama, Kazuo Yamamoto",2018 Jan-Feb,"Background:
        
      
      Decompression sickness (DCS) is a rare condition that is often difficult to diagnose in deep-sea divers. Because of this, prevention and early diagnosis are important. In this case-control study, we examined the risk and preventive factors associated with DCS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Our original questionnaire survey was conducted among 269 recreational divers in Okinawa. Divers who were diagnosed with DCS by a physician (n = 94) were compared with healthy recreational divers (n = 175). The questionnaire consisted of 30 items and included a dive profile. Odds ratios and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to estimate the relative risk of DCS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Logistic regression analysis revealed the following risk factors for DCS: a past history of DCS, drinking alcohol the evening before diving, indicating decompression stops, cold exposure after the dive, and maximum depth. Preventive factors included hydration before the dive, deep stops, safety stops and using nitrox gas. The results were reliable according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow and omnibus tests.

      We identified certain risk factors, together with their relative risks, for DCS. These risk factors may facilitate prevention of DCS among Okinawa divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29571231/,2022-11-27 11:20:13 PM
[What is the Best Therapeutic Strategy for Decompression Illness? First Aid Oxygen Inhalation and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy],"Kiyotaka Kohshi, Yoshitaka Morimatsu, Hideharu Nishikiori, Hideki Tamaki, Tatsuya Ishitake, Kiyotaka Kohshi, Yoshitaka Morimatsu, Hideharu Nishikiori, Hideki Tamaki, Tatsuya Ishitake",2021,"Decompression illness (DCI), a syndrome following inadequate reduction in environmental pressure, has two forms: decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism after pulmonary barotrauma. Recompression therapy using oxygen, a kind of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, has been considered the gold standard treatment for DCI, although there is no randomized controlled trial evidence for its use. We evaluated the effectiveness of recompression therapy in treating DCI by reviewing the reported therapeutic results of serious DCI, especially neurological disorders. Early or ultra-early recompression therapy did not dramatically improve clinical recovery from DCI symptoms, including spinal cord disorders. In contrast, early first aid normobaric oxygen inhalation highly improved or stabilized clinical conditions of DCI. Based on these clinical results, the international committee for hyperbaric and diving medicine has stated that cases of mild DCI may be managed without recompression therapy. Further work is needed to clarify the clinical utility of recompression therapy for spinal injury as a common symptom of DCI. We also point out that the Japanese decree ""Ordinance on Safety and Health of Work under High Pressure"", which describes work under hyperbaric environments, has some serious issues and should be amended on the basis of scientific evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34092769/,2022-11-27 11:20:14 PM
The Hyperbaric Protective Tube: A housing for a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber,"Jacek Kot, Piotr Siondalski, Ewa Lenkiewicz, Jacek Kot, Piotr Siondalski, Ewa Lenkiewicz",2019 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      During a hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) session, every medical device that is used within the hyperbaric chamber is exposed to several hazards, including an increased ambient pressure and partial pressure of oxygen. In Europe, all medical devices marketed and/or sold for use in hyperbaric conditions must be tested by the manufacturer and marked 'CE' if approved. At the moment, no left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been formally approved and CE-marked for HBOT.
    


          Case:
        
      
      A 65-year-old male was referred to our Hyperbaric Centre for HBOT due to a persistent life-threating soft tissue infection of the non-removable wire connecting the external controller with the pump implanted into the left ventricle of the heart (Heartware LVAD). The aim of the intervention reported here was to safely conduct HBOT sessions with this non-CE marked medical device. After risk analysis, the decision was made to isolate the external part of the LVAD (controller and batteries) from the ambient conditions in the hyperbaric chamber by placing it in a pressure-resistant housing that was vented to the external atmosphere. The housing, a 'Hyperbaric Protective Tube' was built and tested, and the resulting operating procedures were practiced by personnel involved in the patient's care. Thirty uneventful HBOT standard sessions were conducted with subsequent clinical improvement of the soft tissue infection, resulting in an extended timeframe for awaiting heart transplantation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An isolation housing that vents into the dumping system of the hyperbaric chamber allows for the safe use of critical medical devices without prior testing for their compatibility with the hyperbaric environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177520/,2022-11-27 11:20:15 PM
Executive Functions of Divers Are Selectively Impaired at 20-Meter Water Depth,"Fabian Steinberg, Michael Doppelmayr, Fabian Steinberg, Michael Doppelmayr",2017 Jun 20,"Moving and acting underwater within recreational or occupational activities require intact executive functions, since they subserve higher cognitive functions such as successful self-regulation, coping with novel situations, and decision making; all of which could be influenced by nitrogen narcosis due to elevated partial pressure under water. However, specific executive functions that could provide a differentiated view on humans' cognitive performance ability have not yet been systematically analyzed in full-water immersion, which is a research gap addressed within this approach to contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen narcosis. In this study, 20 young, healthy, and certified recreational divers participated and performed three different executive-function tests: the Stroop test (Inhibition), the Number/Letter test (Task switching), the 2-back test (Updating/Working memory), and a simple reaction time test (Psychomotor performance). These tests were performed once on land, at 5-meter (m) water depth, and at 20-meter (m) water depth of an indoor diving facility in standardized test conditions (26°C in all water depths). A water-proofed and fully operational tablet computer was used to present visual stimuli and to register reaction times. Performance of the simple reaction time test was not different between underwater and land testing, suggesting that reaction times were not biased by the utilization of the tablet in water immersion. Executive functions were not affected by the shallow water immersion of 5-m water depth. However, performance scores in 20-m water depth revealed a decreased performance in the incongruent test condition (i.e., an index of inhibitory control ability) of the Stroop test, while all other tests were unaffected. Even though only one out of the three tested cognitive domains was affected, the impairment of inhibitory control ability even in relatively shallow water of 20-m is a critical component that should be considered for diver's safety, since inhibition is required in self-control requiring situations where impulsive and automatic behavior must be inhibited. Our interpretation of these selective impairments is based on a discussion suggesting that different neural networks within the central nervous system, which process specific executive functions, are affected differently by nitrogen narcosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28676772/,2022-11-27 11:20:16 PM
Clustering of recreational divers by their health conditions in a database of a citizen science project,"Tamer Ozyigit, Cuneyt Yavuz, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni, Tamer Ozyigit, Cuneyt Yavuz, Salih Murat Egi, Massimo Pieri, Costantino Balestra, Alessandro Marroni",2019,"Divers Alert Network Europe has created a database with a large amount of dive-related data that has been collected since 1993 within the scope of the Diving Safety Laboratory citizen science project. The main objectives of this study are the grouping divers by their health information and revealing significant differences in diving parameters using data mining techniques. Due to the methodology of the project, data cleaning was performed before applying clustering methods in order to eliminate potential mistakes resulting from inaccuracies and missing information. Despite the fact that 63% of the data were lost during the cleaning phase, the remaining 1,169 ""clean"" diver data enabled meaningful clustering using the ""two-step"" method. Experienced male divers without any health problems are in Cluster 1. Male and female divers with health problems and high rates of cigarette smoking are in Cluster 2; healthy, overweight divers are in Cluster 3. There are significant differences in terms of dive parameters including pre- and post-dive conditions with respect to each group, such as: exercise level, alcohol consumption, thermal comfort, equipment malfunctions, and maximum depth. The study proves the usefulness of citizen science projects, while data collection methodologies can be improved to decrease potential mistakes resulting from inconsistencies, inaccuracies and missing information. It is hypothesized that if naturally occurring clusters of divers were identified it might be possible to identify risk factors arising from different clusters while merging the database with other dive accident databases in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31051062/,2022-11-27 11:20:16 PM
Understanding the impact of road design characteristic on teen driver's fatality,"Woon Kim, A M Svancara, T Kelley-Baker, Woon Kim, A M Svancara, T Kelley-Baker",2020,"Objective: There is little research simultaneously examining both teen drivers' characteristics and the driving environment. This study aimed to investigate how traffic engineering factors (road designs, traffic operations, and surface conditions) contribute to risks of teen driver's fatality. Understanding the role of traffic engineering factors can further improve efforts to reduce teen diving-related fatal crashes.Methods: This study used the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and General Estimate System for years 2014 to 2015. We explored numerous engineering variables: horizontal/vertical alignment, intersections types, interchange areas, traffic ways types, posted speed limit, work zone areas, types of traffic control devices and road surface conditions. Traditional variables considered in this study included sex, age, presence of passengers in relation to age group, time of day, lighting condition, season, vehicle model year, vehicle type, seatbelt use, crash type and movement prior to a crash. We ran cross-tabulations and unadjusted analyses to report unadjusted odds ratios of teen driver's fatality. A multiple logistic regression model was used to identify which variables related to road design and traffic operations remained significant after being adjusted by other variables.Results: For traditional factors, results corroborated prior findings. All the engineering factors, except work zone area, were significant in the unadjusted analyses; four variables - horizontal alignments, posted speed limit, traffic control device type, and traffic way type - remained statistically significant in the final model. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of curved high-speed segment was nearly seven times (6.94; 95% CI = 3.58, 13.46) that of a straight segment with a low posted speed limit (reference group). The AOR of no traffic control was four times (4.17; 95% CI = 2.95, 5.88) that of roads with traffic controls. The AOR of a two-way undivided road was almost three times (2.75, 95% CI = 1.43, 5.29) that of a two-way median barrier road (reference group).Conclusions: This study suggests teen driver education programs consider addressing road design characteristics. For example, incorporating focused lessons on traffic signs and traffic control types may better prepare young people for their driving experiences. Additionally, more supervised driving time is needed on various road types, especially those that present greater risks (e.g., roads with grades/curves, intersections with no traffic signal, undivided roads, and unpaved roads).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32319815/,2022-11-27 11:20:17 PM

Although myoglobin is not homogeneously distributed, cetacean muscle O2 stores have been often determined by measuring Mb concentration from a single muscle sample (longissimus dorsi) and multiplying that value by the animal's locomotor muscle or total muscle mass. This study serves to determine the accuracy of previous cetacean muscle O2 stores calculations. For that, body muscles from three delphinid species: Delphinus delphis, Stenella coeruleoalba, and Stenella frontalis, were dissected and weighed. Mb concentration was calculated from six muscles/muscle groups (epaxial, hypaxial and rectus abdominis; mastohumeralis; sternohyoideus; and dorsal scalenus), each representative of different functional groups (locomotion powering swimming, pectoral fin movement, feeding and respiration, respectively). Results demonstrated that the Mb concentration was heterogeneously distributed, being significantly higher in locomotor muscles. Locomotor muscles were the major contributors to total muscle O2 stores (mean 92.8%) due to their high Mb concentration and large muscle masses. Compared to this method, previous studies assuming homogenous Mb concentration distribution likely underestimated total muscle O2 stores by 10% when only considering locomotor muscles and overestimated them by 13% when total muscle mass was considered.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572177/,2022-11-27 11:20:18 PM
Hyberbaric oxygen as sole treatment for severe radiation - induced haemorrhagic cystitis,"Athanasios Dellis, Athanasios Papatsoris, Vasileios Kalentzos, Charalambos Deliveliotis, Andreas Skolarikos, Athanasios Dellis, Athanasios Papatsoris, Vasileios Kalentzos, Charalambos Deliveliotis, Andreas Skolarikos",2017 May-Jun,"Purpose:
        
      
      To examine the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen as the primary and sole treatment for severe radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Hyperbaric oxygen was prospectively applied as primary treatment in 38 patients with severe radiation cystitis. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of complete and partial response to treatment, while the secondary endpoints included the duration of response, the correlation of treatment success-rate to the interval between the onset of haematuria and initiation of therapy, blood transfusion need and total radiation dose, the number of sessions to success, the avoidance of surgery and the overall survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients completed therapy without complications with a mean follow-up of 29.33 months. Median number of sessions needed was 33. Complete and partial response rate was 86.8% and 13.2%, respectively. All 33 patients with complete response received therapy within 6 months of the haematuria onset. One patient needed cystectomy, while 33 patients were alive at the end of follow-up.

A Delphi study to identify relevant scenarios as the first step toward an international hyperbaric medicine simulation curriculum,"Sylvain Boet, Joseph K Burns, Eric Jenisset, Mélanie Papp, Sylvie Bourbonnais, Rodrigue Pignel, Sylvain Boet, Joseph K Burns, Eric Jenisset, Mélanie Papp, Sylvie Bourbonnais, Rodrigue Pignel",2022 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Evidence across healthcare specialties suggests that simulation-based education improves practices and patient outcomes. However, simulation has yet to be widely used in hyperbaric medicine education. We aimed to identify the most relevant clinical scenarios for inclusion in a simulation-based curriculum for hyperbaric medicine.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After ethics approval, we used a modified Delphi consensus method. We assembled an initial questionnaire and distributed it online in English and French to an international group of hyperbaric physicians and operators using a snowball recruitment technique. Participants rated the list of scenarios using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (least relevant) to 5 (most relevant). Scenarios judged by at least 80% of participants to be relevant (score 4 or 5) were automatically included. Scenarios that did not meet this threshold and new scenarios suggested by participants during the first round were included in a second round.

Diving Buoyancy,"Keith A. Raymond, Brian West, Jeffrey S. Cooper, Keith A. Raymond, Brian West, Jeffrey S. Cooper",,"Buoyancy while scuba diving, snorkeling, or swimming is a safety skill. It also has multiple medical and diving implications. A diver’s air consumption and fatigue are strongly correlated with their buoyancy control. Ascent and descent in a water column (whether salt or fresh) when controlled, protects the diver from barotrauma of both sinus and middle ears, pulmonary hyperinflation, air embolism, and reduces the risk of decompression sickness. Buoyancy control also affects and protects both the diver and the marine environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29261960/,2022-11-27 11:20:19 PM
Does exposure to bentonite dust during tunnel hyperbaric interventions increase health risks for compressed air workers? A prospective qualitative and quantitative safety assessment,"Owen J O'Neill, Justin Costello, John Sullivan, Lisa Castellon, Owen J O'Neill, Justin Costello, John Sullivan, Lisa Castellon",2019,"Introduction:
        
      
      The mining and tunneling industries are historically associated with hazardous exposures that result in significant occupational health concerns. Occupational respiratory exposures causing pneumoconiosis and silicosis are of great concern, silicosis being non-curable. This work demonstrates that compressed-air workers (CAWs) performing tunnel hyperbaric interventions (HIs) may be at risk for hazards related to bentonite exposure, increasing the likelihood of developing harmful illnesses including cancer. Bentonite dust inhalation may result in respiratory levels of silica exceeding acceptable industrial hygiene standards.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A qualitative observational exposure assessment was conducted on CAWs while they were performing their HI duties. This was followed by quantitative data collection using personal and area air sample techniques. The results were analyzed and interpreted using standard industrial hygiene principles and guidelines from NIOSH and OSHA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our work suggests bentonite dust exposure may be an emerging particulate matter concern among CAWs in the tunneling industry. Aerosolized bentonite particles may have potential deleterious effects that include pneumoconiosis and silicosis. Silicosis can result in the development of pulmonary carcinoma.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The modern tunneling industry and required hyperbaric interventional tasks represent a potential public health and occupational concern for CAWs. This paper introduces the modern tunneling industry and the duties of CAWs, the hazardous environment in which they perform their duties, and describes the risks and potential harmful health effects associated with these hazardous exposures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31509901/,2022-11-27 11:20:20 PM
Risk mitigation in divers with persistent (patent) foramen ovale,"Peter Wilmshurst, Peter Wilmshurst",2019 Jun 30,"In this issue, Anderson and colleagues report follow-up of divers who were found to have a persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO) or, in eleven cases, an atrial septal defect (ASD). In most divers diagnosis followed an episode of decompression illness (DCI). The efficacy of closure of the PFO/ASD in preventing future DCI was compared with conservative diving. They reported that in the closure group the occurrence of confirmed DCI decreased significantly compared with pre-closure, but in the conservative group this reduction was not significant.
    

      
      It is believed there are three requirements for a diver to suffer shunt-mediated DCI: A significant right-to-left shunt (usually a large PFO but sometimes an ASD or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation). Venous bubbles nucleated during decompression circumvent the lung filter by passing through the shunt. Target tissues are supersaturated with dissolved inert gas, so that they are able to amplify embolic bubbles. All three are required because DCI does not occur after contrast echocardiography when bubbles cross a right-to-left shunt.
    

      
      Therefore, there are two ways that a diver who has suffered shunt-mediated DCI may continue to dive - either their shunt is sealed or future dives should be so conservative that venous bubbles are not liberated and/or critical tissues are not able to amplify embolic bubbles.
    

      
      PFO/ASD closure will give divers a risk of DCI comparable to the risk in others without a right-to-left shunt, if the procedure adequately seals the shunt. Closure of the shunt will not prevent a diver suffering DCI by other mechanisms, such as when there is arterial gas embolism (AGE) as a result of pulmonary barotrauma or when the dive profile is provocative (e.g., if there is rapid ascent or missed decompression stops). Conservative diving will be effective only if all the dives performed are truly conservative and prevent bubble nucleation and/or amplification.
    

      
      The study by Anderson et al. has a number of serious limitations. The study was small with only 62 self-selected divers, who self-reported outcomes. Eleven divers had not had DCI when their PFO or ASD was detected. Initially 36 divers were classified as closure and 26 as conservative treatment, but six subjects crossed from the conservative group to the closure group. Three of the six dived in the conservative group before having closure and are classified in both groups depending on whether the dives performed were before or after closure. As a result, there were 42 in the closure group and 23 in the conservative group.
    

      
      Randomisation to the treatment groups was not possible and its absence results in imbalance. Because the closure group is approximately twice as large as the conservative group, similar changes in incidence would have a greater probability of achieving statistical significance in the former. Large shunts were present in more than three-quarters of the closure group but fewer than half of the conservative group. The authors have three definitions of a 'large' PFO, so the definition of large was inconsistent. All ASDs were considered to be large.
    

      
      When dealing with small numbers, one needs patient-level data, but that is lacking and may mask inconsistency in management. The divers were investigated and treated in at least 38 hospitals (some divers did not state where they were treated). We do not know what devices were used for PFO/ASD closure, and closure effectiveness varies, or what tests were performed to assess the effectiveness of closure.
    

      
      The primary end-point was not different between the two groups because only two episodes of confirmed DCI occurred in each group. The authors also considered a softer and subjective end-point, possible DCI.
    

      
      Crucially we are not told what the divers in the conservative group were told constitutes a conservative dive and whether it was consistent. Nor are we told whether they followed the advice given. That is important because it appears that incidence of possible DCI increased considerably in only the conservative group, which means either that the advice they were given on what constitutes a conservative dive was flawed, that the divers failed to follow good advice or that they frequently reported innocent symptoms as possible DCI, because knowledge that they had a PFO may have increased their reporting - introducing further bias.
    

      
      There should be assessment of whether DCI after the intervention was shunt-mediated or had another cause. For that assessment, one needs to know details of the dives resulting in symptoms, clinical manifestations and latency of onset.
    

      
      I have investigated 20 divers who had DCI after PFO closure. In five divers, a contrast echocardiogram showed a significant residual shunt. Typically, the diver had their closure procedure by a cardiologist lacking knowledge of diving medicine and no post-closure contrast echocardiogram was performed. In one case, the diver's PFO was closed but they had a residual pulmonary shunt that was not detected. In those cases where there is a significant residual shunt, the dive profiles, clinical manifestations and latencies of onset were typical of shunt-mediated DCI.
    

      
      Three divers, who had PFO closure with no residual shunt, subsequently had neurological symptoms with manifestations consistent with AGE secondary to pulmonary barotrauma. High resolution CT scans of their chests showed pulmonary bullae and emphysema.
    

      
      The remaining divers seen had no residual shunt but had performed highly provocative dives, usually much deeper than 50 metres' sea water (msw). The most recent case that I saw had dived to 102 metres' fresh water (mfw) in a lake at high altitude breathing trimix.
    

      
      In contrast, several hundred divers in whom I diagnosed a PFO and who elected to dive conservatively had not reported further DCI. I advised them that I have never seen shunt-mediated DCI after dives breathing air to depths of 15 msw or less provided no rules were broken. So I set that as the depth limit or allow them to dive to greater depths breathing nitrox so that there are equivalent partial pressures of nitrogen (e.g., 19 msw with nitrox 32 or 23 msw with nitrox 40) provided they use an air decompression table/algorithm. Alternatively, one can dive using the DCIEM recreational air diving table.
    

      
      Recurrence of DCI after PFO closure may be the result of a residual shunt or may have other causes. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the safety of 'conservative' diving unless one knows what the divers were advised constitutes conservative dives and whether they adhered to the advice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177512/,2022-11-27 11:20:21 PM
Performance of life support breathing apparatus for under-ice diving operations,"Michael A Lang, John R Clarke, Michael A Lang, John R Clarke",2017 Jul-Aug,"Introduction:
        
      
      Single-hose scuba regulators dived in very cold water may suffer first- or second-stage malfunction, yielding complete occlusion of air flow or massive freeflow that rapidly expends a diver's air supply.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This study, conducted in Antarctica, evaluated the under-ice performance of a sampling of commercially available regulators.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventeen science divers logged a total of 305 dives in -1.86°C seawater under 6-meter-thick Antarctic fast-ice over two field seasons in 2008 and 2009. Dive profiles had an average depth of 30 msw and dive time of 29 minutes, including a mandatory three-minute safety stop at 6 msw. Sixty-nine unmodified regulator units (17 models) from 12 different manufacturers underwent standardized pre-dive regulator care and were randomly assigned to divers. Depths and times of onset of second-stage regulator freeflow were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In 305 dives, there were 65 freeflows. The freeflows were not evenly distributed across the regulator brands. Regulator failure rates fell into two categories (⟨ 11% and ⟩ 26%). The regulators classified for the purpose of the test as ""acceptable"" (⟨ 11% failure rate: Dive-Rite Jetstream, Sherwood Maximus SRB3600, Poseidon Xstream Deep, Poseidon Jetstream, Sherwood Maximus SRB7600, Poseidon Cyklon, Mares USN22 Abyss) experienced only nine freeflows out of 146 exposures for a 6% overall freeflow incidence. Those classified as ""unacceptable"" (⟨ 26% failure rate) suffered 56 freeflows out of 159 exposures (35% freeflow incidence.).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Contrary to expectations, the pooled incidences for the seven best performing regulators was significantly different by Chi-square test from the 10 remaining regulators (P ⟨ 0.001).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28783885/,2022-11-27 11:20:22 PM
Aquaticity: A discussion of the term and of how it applies to humans,"Danae Varveri, Christina Karatzaferi, Elizana Pollatou, Giorgos K Sakkas, Danae Varveri, Christina Karatzaferi, Elizana Pollatou, Giorgos K Sakkas",2016 Apr,"The relationship between humans and water and the effects on aspects related to human performance has never been studied scientifically. The aim of the current systematic review is to attempt to define the term ""aquaticity"", present the factors that describe it and reveal the form in which it presents itself in today's society, in order to become a distinct scientific field of study. A systematic review of the literature has been conducted using anecdotal reports from the internet and forums as well as scientific articles and books from databases on issues related to aquatic sports. To the best of our knowledge there are no scientific articles dealing with human's aquaticity. In the current systematic review, four factors have been recognized that are closely related to human aquaticity. Those are related to physical condition in the water, to apnea and ability to immerse, to mental health and to parameters related to body composition. According to our findings, ""Aquaticity is the capacity of a terrestrial mammalian organism to function and habitualise in the aquatic environment. The level of aquaticity depends on mental and physical characteristics and can be improved by frequent exposure to the water element"". The ideal state of aquaticity is achieved through the activation of the diving reflex, when the human body is totally immersed in water. The development of knowledge regarding the aquatic environment leads humans to an improved state of aquaticity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27210836/,2022-11-27 11:20:22 PM
Prolonged syncope with multifactorial pulmonary oedema related to dry apnoea training: Safety concerns in unsupervised dry static apnoea,"Juan M Valdivia-Valdivia, Anne Räisänen-Sokolowski, Peter Lindholm, Juan M Valdivia-Valdivia, Anne Räisänen-Sokolowski, Peter Lindholm",2021 Jun 30,"Many competitive breath-hold divers use dry apnoea routines to improve their tolerance to hypoxia and hypercapnia, varying the amount of prior hyperventilation and lung volume. When hyperventilating and exhaling to residual volume prior to starting a breath-hold, hypoxia is reached quickly and without too much discomfort from respiratory drive. Cerebral hypoxia with loss of consciousness (LOC) can easily result. Here, we report on a case where an unsupervised diver used a nose clip that is thought to have interfered with his resumption of breathing after LOC. Consequently, he suffered an extended period of severe hypoxia, with poor ventilation and recovery. He also held his breath on empty lungs; thus, trying to inhale created an intrathoracic sub-atmospheric pressure. Upon imaging at the hospital, severe intralobular pulmonary oedema was noted, with similarities to images presented in divers suffering from pulmonary barotrauma of descent (squeeze, immersion pulmonary oedema). Describing the physiological phenomena observed in this case highlights the risks associated with unsupervised exhalatory breath-holding after hyperventilation as a training practice in competitive freediving.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34157738/,2022-11-27 11:20:23 PM

Decreasing carbon monoxide in the diving air of artisanal fishermen in the Yucatán peninsula by separation of engine exhaust from compressor intake,"Walter Chin, Oswaldo Huchim-Lara, Silvia Salas, Walter Chin, Oswaldo Huchim-Lara, Silvia Salas",2016 Jul-Aug,"Artisanal fishermen in the Yucatán Peninsula utilize hookah dive systems (HDS). The air compressors in these HDS are not filtered, and the intake is near the engine exhaust. This proximity allows carbon monoxide (CO) from the exhaust to directly enter the HDS volume tank and contaminate the fishermen diver's air supply. Conservative safety standards permit a diver's air supply to contain 10 parts per million (ppm) of CO. This study quantified the levels of CO in the diver's air supply both before and after physical separation of the engine exhaust from the compressor intake. CO levels in seven volume tanks were analyzed before and after a 1-inch hose was attached to the compressor intake and elevated 5 feet above the engine exhaust. The tanks were drained and refilled before collecting each set of pre- and post-intervention gas samples. Four CO measurements were collected before and after the intervention from each volume tank. A C-Squared© CO Analyzer (± 1 ppm), calibrated with a Praxair 70 ppm CON2 gas (± 5%), was used to analyze the gas samples. A paired samples t-test shows a statistically significant difference in average CO values before and after the intervention (t = 6.8674, df: 27; p⟨0.0001). The physical separation of the engine exhaust from the compressor intake reduced the CO contamination of the diver air supply by 72%. This intervention could be applied to the hookah systems in the rest of the fishing cooperative to reduce the divers' risk of CO poisoning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28763170/,2022-11-27 11:20:24 PM
A day in the life of a diabetic diver: the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society/Divers Alert Network protocol for diving with diabetes in action,"Rebecca Johnson, Rebecca Johnson",2016 Sep,"Some people with well-managed insulin-dependent diabetes can dive safely. Those cleared to participate should control tightly the variables that impact blood glucose levels, including activity, timing, food and insulin. Honest self-assessment is critical. A diabetic diver should cancel a dive if seasick, unusually anxious, or following significant high or low blood glucose levels in the preceding 24 hours. The diver should enter the water with a blood glucose level above 8.3 mmol·L⁻¹ and below 14 mmol·L⁻¹ with a stable or rising trend in blood glucose established with glucose tests at 90, 60, and 30 minutes prior to a dive. The diver should carry emergency glucose at all times and brief dive buddies about hypoglycaemia procedures. This is a personal account of the author's experience diving with type 1 diabetes and details how the UHMS/DAN recommendations are put into practice on dive days.

Fatal diving accidents in western Norway 1983-2007,"M P Ramnefjell, I Morild, S J Mørk, P K Lilleng, M P Ramnefjell, I Morild, S J Mørk, P K Lilleng",2012 Nov 30,"Despite efforts to reduce their number, fatal diving accidents still occur. The circumstances and post-mortem findings in 40 fatal diving accidents in western Norway from 1983 through 2007 were investigated. Diving experience, medical history and toxicology reports were retrieved. The material consisted of recreational divers, professional saturation divers and professional divers without experience with saturation. In 33 cases the diving equipment was examined as part of the forensic investigation. In 27 cases defects in the diving equipment were found. For six divers such defects were responsible for the fatal accidents. Eighteen divers died on the surface or less than 10 m below surface. Five divers reached below 100 msw, and two of them died at this depth. The fatalities were not season-dependent. However, wave-height and strength of currents were influential factors in some cases. Twelve divers were diving alone. Twenty divers had one buddy, 9 of these divers were alone at the time of death. The cause of death was drowning in 31 out of 40 divers; one of them had a high blood-ethanol concentration, in two other divers ethanol was found in the urine, indicating previous ethanol consumption.

Safety proposals for freediving time limits should consider the metabolic-rate dependence of oxygen stores depletion,"Charlotte Sadler, Kaighley Brett, Aaron Heerboth, Austin R Swisher, Nader Mehregani, Ross Touriel, Daniel T Cannon, Charlotte Sadler, Kaighley Brett, Aaron Heerboth, Austin R Swisher, Nader Mehregani, Ross Touriel, Daniel T Cannon",2020 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      There is no required training for breath-hold diving, making dissemination of safety protocols difficult. A recommended breath-hold dive time limit of 60 s was proposed for amateur divers. However, this does not consider the metabolic-rate dependence of oxygen stores depletion. We aimed to measure the effect of apnoea time and metabolic rate on arterial and tissue oxygenation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty healthy participants (23 (SD 3) y, 22 women) completed four periods of apnoea for 60 s (or to tolerable limit) during rest and cycle ergometry at 20, 40, and 60 W. Apnoea was initiated after hyperventilation to achieve PETCO2 of approximately 25 mmHg. Pulse oximetry, frontal lobe oxygenation, and pulmonary gas exchange were measured throughout. We defined hypoxia as SpO2 < 88%.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Static and exercise (20, 40, 60 W) breath-hold break times were 57 (SD 7), 50 (11), 48 (11), and 46 (11) s (F [2.432, 119.2] = 32.0, P < 0.01). The rise in PETCO2 from initiation to breaking of apnoea was dependent on metabolic rate (time × metabolic rate interaction; F [3,147] = 38.6, P < 0.0001). The same was true for the fall in SpO2 (F [3,147] = 2.9, P = 0.03). SpO2 fell to < 88% on 14 occasions in eight participants, all of whom were asymptomatic.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Independent of the added complexities of a fall in ambient pressure on ascent, the effect of apnoea time on hypoxia depends on the metabolic rate and is highly variable among individuals. Therefore, we contend that a universally recommended time limit for breath-hold diving or swimming is not useful to guarantee safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325016/,2022-11-27 11:20:26 PM
"Snorkelling and breath-hold diving fatalities in Australia, 2001 to 2013. Demographics, characteristics and chain of events","John Lippmann, John Lippmann",2019 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of victims of fatal snorkelling and breath-hold diving accidents in Australia from 2001-2013, inclusive, to determine underlying factors and risks associated with such activities and inform appropriate countermeasures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was searched to identify snorkelling and breath-hold diving-related cases reported to Australian coroners for the years 2001-2013, inclusive. Coronial data in the form of findings, witness and police reports, medical histories and autopsies were collected and collated, and descriptive statistics were used to analyse these data. A chain of events analysis was used to determine the likely sequence of events.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 175 identified snorkelling-related fatalities during the study period. Most victims were middle-aged males (mean age 49 years). Pre-existing health conditions were possible contributors to 41% of the deaths, the main being ischaemic heart disease. The majority of deaths occurred in Queensland in inexperienced snorkellers, often in commercial settings. The victim's plight often went unnoticed as they were alone, or poorly supervised, when the incident occurred. Apnoeic hypoxia appeared to have been associated with at least 12.5% of the deaths. The main disabling injuries were asphyxia (40%) and cardiac incidents (35%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Human factors, such as chronic health conditions, poor skills and inexperience and poor planning can play a substantial role throughout the chain of events leading to a snorkelling fatality. It is important to educate the community, doctors and dive industry professionals about potential problems associated with the interaction between certain health-related conditions, especially cardiovascular conditions, and snorkelling. Close supervision is strongly recommended for inexperienced snorkellers due to their likely poor skills, as well as for experienced breath-hold divers due to the potential for apnoeic hypoxia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31523794/,2022-11-27 11:20:27 PM
"Medical conditions in scuba diving fatality victims in Australia, 2001 to 2013","John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      This study identified pre-existing medical conditions among scuba diving fatalities in Australia from 2001 to 2013, inclusive, and assessed whether these conditions likely contributed to the deaths.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was searched for scuba diving-related cases during 2001-2013, inclusive. Coronial findings, witness and police reports, medical histories, and autopsy and toxicology reports were scrutinised for pre-existing medical conditions and autopsy findings. Predisposing factors, triggers, disabling agents, disabling injuries and causes of death were analysed using a validated template.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 126 scuba diving-related fatalities identified during the study period. Forty-six (37%) divers were identified as having a significant medical condition which may have contributed to their incident. The most common condition was ischaemic heart disease (IHD) which had been diagnosed in 15 of the divers. Thirty-two (25%) deaths were attributed to cardiac disabling injuries (DI) such as ischaemic heart disease and arrhythmias, although a cardiac DI was thought likely in another six. Respiratory conditions were implicated in eight (6%) deaths, at least four associated with cerebral arterial gas embolism. At least 14 (11%) divers who had contributory pre-existing medical conditions had been cleared to dive by a medical practitioner within the year prior.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Chronic health-related factors played a major role in almost half of these deaths; primarily cardiac conditions such as IHD and cardiac arrhythmias. Although fitness-to-dive (FTD) assessments have limitations, the high incidence of cardiac-related deaths indicates a need for 'older' divers to be medically assessed for FTD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557410/,2022-11-27 11:20:28 PM

Long-term analysis of Irukandji stings in Far North Queensland,"Teresa J Carrette, Jamie J Seymour, Teresa J Carrette, Jamie J Seymour",2013 Mar,"Introduction:
        
      
      We reviewed the occurrence, trends, definition and severity of the Irukandji syndrome for the Cairns region of North Queensland, Australia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis of patient files from two sources was conducted: historic accounts kept by Dr Jack Barnes for the period 1942 to 1967, and records from the Emergency Unit in Cairns Base Hospital for 1995 to 2007.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There has been a significant increase in the length of the Irukandji season since it was first reliably recorded (15 days in 1961; 151 days in 2002); however, annual numbers of envenomations were highly variable. Traditionally, greater frequencies of Irukandji stings were reported at onshore as opposed to offshore locations. However, in recent years this trend has reversed, potentially because of increased safety protocols for beach regions. Mean Troponin I levels were higher in offshore reef envenomations compared to those from islands or coastal regions. In terms of morphine-equivalent doses, patients given fentanyl received significantly greater opioid doses compared to those given morphine or pethidine. Opioid dosage was indicative of syndrome severity and correlated with other physiological parameters measured. Five major symptoms were associated with Irukandji syndrome: pain, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, headache and shortness of breath. Pain was the overwhelming symptom, followed closely by nausea/vomiting.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The duration of the Irukandji season appears to be increasing. Conversely the number of envenomings appears to be decreasing, possibly because of improved beach management in recent years. Offshore envenomings appear to have a higher potential for more severe envenomings with five associated major symptoms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23508658/,2022-11-27 11:20:30 PM
Risky business: a 15-year analysis of fatal coastal drowning of young male adults in Australia,"Jasmin C Lawes, Annabel Ellis, Shane Daw, Luke Strasiotto, Jasmin C Lawes, Annabel Ellis, Shane Daw, Luke Strasiotto",2021 Oct,"Introduction:
        
      
      Drowning is a leading cause of unintentional death, especially for males. In Australian coastal waters, young male adults account for 25% of the burden of male drowning. This study aims to describe young male coastal drowning deaths and to examine the prevalence of risk factors, especially alcohol and drugs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Characteristics of unintentional fatal drowning involving males (15-34 years) were compared with other adults (15 years and older). Data were sourced from the National Coronial Information System (Australia) and Surf Life Saving incident reports (2004/2005-2018/2019). Relative risk was calculated and χ2 tests of independence were performed (p<0.05). Blood alcohol and drug concentrations were analysed with permutational analyses of variance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Young males drowned more while jumping (9.85 times), swimming/wading (1.41 times), at rock/cliff locations (1.42 times) and on public holidays (1.8 times). Young males drowned less while boating (0.81 times), scuba diving (2.08 times), offshore (1.56 times) or due to medical factors (3.7 times). Young males drowned more (1.68 times) after consuming illicit drugs (amphetamines 2.26 times; cannabis 2.25 times) and less with prescription drugs (benzodiazepines 2.6 times; opiates 4.1 times; antidepressants 7.7 times). Blood serum concentrations of cannabis were higher in young males, while amphetamine and alcohol were lower.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Unsafe behaviours alongside certain activities or locations create deadly combinations of risk factors. A relationship between age, activity, attitude and affluence is proposed, where young males drown more in affordable activities with fewer regulations. Our results support multilevel strategies (spanning life stages) to reduce young male coastal drowning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33239312/,2022-11-27 11:20:31 PM
Decompression sickness predictive models for unsafe human exposure,"P K Weathersby, K A Gault, P K Weathersby, K A Gault",2013 May-Jun,"Decompression sickness (DCS) incidence prediction models have achieved useful predictive success under conditions of routine Navy diving. However, extrapolation into higher-risk exposures, e.g., emergency conditions, has been a problem. We have assembled a calibration data set of 3,300 single exposures with 200 DCS cases emphasizing high-incidence data from the U.S. Navy compilation of manned diving trials. We also evaluated a variant of the older linear-exponential risk model family where the instantaneous risk is defined as the relative supersaturation squared. Goodness of fit was assessed by maximum likelihood, by comparison of categories of observed and predicted cases in three ways (component data set, depth-time group, and risk level), and by reproduction of data dose-response trends. Four models fit the data well. Two had the old risk definition, and two had the new. With each risk definition, a satisfactory set of parameters was found differing mainly in treatment of gas kinetics in the fastest compartment. Multimodel inferences were made with a combination of the four models weighted using the Akaike Information Criterion. The combined model is recommended for use in emergency preparations where compressed-air exposures may lead to a 40% or higher incidence of DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23789560/,2022-11-27 11:20:32 PM
Crew and passenger deaths from vessel accidents in United Kingdom passenger ships since 1900,"Tim Carter, John G Williams, Stephen E Roberts, Tim Carter, John G Williams, Stephen E Roberts",2019,"Background:
        
      
      There is very limited systematic analysis of the causes and consequences of maritime accidents across the whole passenger sector during the twentieth century either in United Kingdom (UK) or in other maritime nations, but some of the larger events have been the subject of detailed investigations that led to improved safety measures. In recent years, there has been increased attention to the analysis of passenger ship accidents, especially in relation to the two now dominant markets: vehicle/passenger ferries and cruise ships.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Long-term trends since 1900 in passenger and crew deaths on UK seagoing pas- senger ships that have sustained a maritime accident, as defined by Lloyds Register, have been collated and analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over the course of the 20th century, there has been a continuous fall in the number of incidents and in their severity. This may be a reflection of improved vessel safety, however the scale and nature of UK passenger shipping has also changed markedly over the period.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In addition to the reducing frequency of deaths it is apparent that the majority of fatalities in both crew and passengers came from a very small number of major events during the study period. Altho- ugh there has been no major disaster involving a UK passenger ship in the last 30 years, major casualties with heavy loss of life continue in the world passenger fleet, in recent years involving flags such as Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Panama and The Philippines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30931511/,2022-11-27 11:20:33 PM
Evaluation of head impact exposure measured from youth football game plays,"Jillian E Urban, William C Flood, Barret J Zimmerman, Mireille E Kelley, Mark A Espeland, Liam McNamara, Elizabeth M Davenport, Alexander K Powers, Christopher T Whitlow, Joseph A Maldjian, Joel D Stitzel, Jillian E Urban, William C Flood, Barret J Zimmerman, Mireille E Kelley, Mark A Espeland, Liam McNamara, Elizabeth M Davenport, Alexander K Powers, Christopher T Whitlow, Joseph A Maldjian, Joel D Stitzel",2019 May 10,"Objective:
        
      
      There is a growing body of literature informing efforts to improve the safety of football; however, research relating on-field activity to head impacts in youth football is limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare head impact exposure (HIE) measured in game plays among 3 youth football teams.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Head impact and video data were collected from athletes (ages 10-13 years) participating on 3 youth football teams. Video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each to a specific play type. Each play was categorized as a down, punt, kickoff, field goal, or false start. Kickoffs and punts were classified as special teams. Downs were classified as running, passing, or other. HIE was quantified by play type in terms of mean, median, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration. Mixed-effects models were used to assess differences in acceleration among play types. Contact occurring on special teams plays was evaluated using a standardized video abstraction form.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3003 head impacts over 27.5 games were analyzed and paired with detailed video coding of plays. Most head impacts were attributed to running (79.6%), followed by passing (14.0%), and special teams (6.4%) plays. The 95th percentile linear acceleration measured during each play type was 52.6g, 50.7g, and 65.5g, respectively. Special teams had significantly greater mean linear acceleration than running and passing plays (both p = 0.03). The most common kick result on special teams was a deep kick, of which 85% were attempted to be returned. No special teams plays resulted in a touchback, and one resulted in a fair catch. One-third of all special teams plays and 92% of all nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results demonstrate a trend toward higher head impact magnitudes on special teams than for running and passing plays, but a greater number of impacts were measured during running plays. Deep kicks were most common on special teams, and many returned and nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. These results support policy changes to youth special teams plays, including modifying the yard line the ball is kicked from and coaching proper return technique. Further investigation into biomechanical exposure measured during game impact scenarios is needed to inform policy relevant to the youth level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31075762/,2022-11-27 11:20:33 PM
Hook Breathing Facilitates SaO2 Recovery After Deep Dives in Freedivers With Slow Recovery,"Fran de Asís Fernández, Lara Rodríguez-Zamora, Erika Schagatay, Fran de Asís Fernández, Lara Rodríguez-Zamora, Erika Schagatay",2019 Aug 30,"To facilitate recovery from hypoxia, many freedivers use a breathing method called ""hook breathing"" (HB) after diving, involving an interrupted exhale to build up intrapulmonary pressure. Some divers experience a delay in recovery of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) after diving, interpreted as symptoms of mild pulmonary edema, and facilitated recovery may be especially important in this group to avoid hypoxic ""blackout."" We examined the influence of HB on recovery of SaO2 in freedivers with slow recovery (SR) and fast recovery (FR) of SaO2 after deep ""free immersion"" (FIM) apnea dives to 30 m depth. Twenty-two male freedivers, with a mean (SD) personal best in the discipline FIM of 57(26) m, performed two 30 m deep dives, one followed by HB and one using normal breathing (NB) during recovery, at different days and weighted order. SaO2 and heart rate (HR) were measured via pulse oximetry during recovery. The SR group (n = 5) had a faster SaO2 recovery using HB, while the FR group (n = 17) showed no difference between breathing techniques. At 105 s, the SR group reached a mean (SD) SaO2 of 95(5)% using HB, while using NB, their SaO2 was 87(5)% (p < 0.05), and 105-120 s after surfacing SaO2 was higher with HB (p < 0.05). In SR subjects, the average time needed to reach 95% SaO2 with HB was 60 s, while it was 120 s at NB (p < 0.05). HR was similar in the SR group, while it was initially elevated at HB in the FR group (p < 0.05). We conclude that HB efficiently increases SaO2 recovery in SR individuals, but not in the FR group. The proposed mechanism is that increased pulmonary pressure with HB will reverse any pulmonary edema and facilitate oxygen uptake in divers with delayed recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31543823/,2022-11-27 11:20:34 PM

Circulating microparticles (MPs)--vesicular structures with diameters of 0.1-1.0 μm--have been implicated, but data in human divers have been lacking. We hypothesized that the number of blood-borne, Annexin V-positive MPs and neutrophil activation, assessed as surface MPO staining, would differ between self-contained underwater breathing-apparatus divers suffering from DCS vs. asymptomatic divers. Blood was analyzed from 280 divers who had been exposed to maximum depths from 7 to 105 meters; 185 were control/asymptomatic divers, and 90 were diagnosed with DCS. Elevations of MPs and neutrophil activation occurred in all divers but normalized within 24 h in those who were asymptomatic. MPs, bearing the following proteins: CD66b, CD41, CD31, CD142, CD235, and von Willebrand factor, were between 2.4- and 11.7-fold higher in blood from divers with DCS vs. asymptomatic divers, matched for time of sample acquisition, maximum diving depth, and breathing gas. Multiple logistic regression analysis documented significant associations (P < 0.001) between DCS and MPs and for neutrophil MPO staining. Effect estimates were not altered by gender, body mass index, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or emergency oxygen treatment and were modestly influenced by divers' age, choice of breathing gas during diving, maximum diving depth, and whether repetitive diving had been performed. There were no significant associations between DCS and number of MPs without surface proteins listed above. We conclude that MP production and neutrophil activation exhibit strong associations with DCS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26139218/,2022-11-27 11:20:36 PM
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS FOR NONFATAL DROWNING IN THE MIGRANT CHILDREN,"Yinchao Zhu, Guozhang Xu, Hui Li, Yaqin Huang, Ke Ding, Jieping Chen, Yinchao Zhu, Guozhang Xu, Hui Li, Yaqin Huang, Ke Ding, Jieping Chen",2015 Nov,"The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and potential risk factors for nonfatal drowning among migrant workers' children in China. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of students from third to ninth grade at five Migrant Workers' Children schools in Ningbo, China in 2014. General information and a history of nonfatal drowning was obtained from self-reported questionnaires by migrant students. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify potential risk factors. A total 3,859 students were included in the current study. Of these, 13.4% had experienced a nonfatal drowning accident (15.2% for males, 11.2% for females). Most nonfatal drowning occurred in natural water settings. Diving into unknown water without adult supervision had the greatest association with history of nonfatal drowning [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidential interval (CI): 1.31-2.95], followed by fishing in water (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05-2.14), swimming or playing in water (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.02-2.12), and trying to rescue peers in the water if they were drowning (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.64). There were factors associated with a lower risk of drowing: having a parent accompany the child to school (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51-0.93),understanding the the danger of swimming alone (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48-0.99) and having a knowledge about water safety (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99). The study population was at inceased risk for nonfatal drowning. Preventive measures, such as improved water-safety knowledge, decreasing risky water-related activities and better supervision of children need to be developed and tested to decrease the risk of nonfatal drowning among the study population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26867370/,2022-11-27 11:20:36 PM
Oxygen exposures at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab: a 20-year experience,"Shane C Walker, Alejandro Garbino, Kristi Ray, Renny Hardwick, Daniel T Fitzpatrick, Robert W Sanders, Shane C Walker, Alejandro Garbino, Kristi Ray, Renny Hardwick, Daniel T Fitzpatrick, Robert W Sanders",2018 Jul-Aug,"Astronauts training for extravehicular activity (EVA) operations can spend many hours submerged underwater in a pressurized suit, called an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU), exposed to pressures exceeding 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA). To minimize the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) a 46% nitrox mixture is used. This limits the nitrogen partial pressure, decreasing the risk of DCS. The trade-off with using a 46% nitrox mixture is the increased potential for oxygen toxicity, which can lead to severe neurologic symptoms including seizures. Suited runs, which typically expose astronauts of 0.9-1.1 ATA for longer than six hours, routinely exceed the recommendation for central nervous system oxygen toxicity limits (CNSOTL) published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Fortunately, in over 50,000 hours of suited training dives spanning 20 years of EVA training operations at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) there has never been an occurrence of oxygen toxicity. This lends support to anecdotal sentiment among certain members of the hyperbaric community that the NOAA CNSOTL recommendations might be overly conservative, at least for the oxygen pressure and time regime in which NBL operates. The NOAA CNSOTL recommendations are the result of expert consensus with a focus on safety and do not necessarily reflect rigorous experimental evidence. The data from the NBL suited dive operations provide a foundation of evidence that can help inform the expert discussion on dive-related neurologic oxygen toxicity performance and overnight recovery in young, healthy males.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30241122/,2022-11-27 11:20:37 PM
Safety of antimalarial medications for use while scuba diving in malaria Endemic Regions,"Kyle Petersen, David P Regis, Kyle Petersen, David P Regis",2016 Oct 11,"Background:
        
      
      Recreational diving occurs annually in areas of the world where malaria is endemic. The safety and efficacy of antimalarials for travelers in a hyperbaric environment is unknown. Of particular concern would be medications with adverse effects that could either mimic diving related illnesses such as barotrauma, decompression sickness (DCS) and gas toxicities, or increase the risk for such illnesses.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a review of PubMed and Cochrane databases to determine rates of neurologic adverse effects or other effects from antimalarials that may be a problem in the diving environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One case report was found on diving and mefloquine. Multiple case reports and clinical trials were found describing neurologic adverse effects of the major chemoprophylactic medications atovaquone/proguanil, chloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, and primaquine.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Of the available literature, atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline are most likely the safest agents and should be preferred; atovaquone/proguanil is superior due to reduced rates of sunburn in the marine environment. Primaquine also appears to be safe, but has reduced efficacy against P. falciparum; mefloquine possesses the highest rate of neurologic side effects and therefore these agents should be limited to extreme cases of patients intolerant to other agents. Chloroquine appears unsafe in the hyperbaric environment and should be avoided. More studies are required to include database reviews of returned divers traveling to malaria endemic areas and randomized controlled trials in the hyperbaric environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28883967/,2022-11-27 11:20:38 PM
Baseline Characteristics and Outcomes After Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy for Macular Edema in Participants With Hemiretinal Vein Occlusion Compared With Participants With Central Retinal Vein Occlusion: Study of Comparative Treatments for Retinal Vein Occlusion 2 (SCORE2) Report 18,"Ingrid U Scott, Neal L Oden, Paul C VanVeldhuisen, Michael S Ip, Barbara A Blodi, SCORE2 Study Investigator Group",2022 May 1,"Importance:
        
      
      Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are commonly used to treat eyes with macular edema secondary to hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Information on whether differences exist in outcomes after anti-VEGF therapy can help guide treatment for each of the different disease types.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare baseline characteristics, treatment burden, and outcomes of macular edema treatment in participants with HRVO with those of participants with CRVO.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This post hoc outcome analysis from the Study of Comparative Treatments for Retinal Vein Occlusion 2 randomized clinical trial included 362 participants with macular edema caused by HRVO or CRVO treated at 66 US sites. Randomization began in September 2014, and the last month 24 follow-up visit occurred in February 2018. Data were analyzed from April 2020 to May 2021.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Eyes were initially randomized to 6 monthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept or bevacizumab and were treated according to protocol between months 6 to 12 depending on 6-month outcome. After month 12, patients were treated per investigator discretion and observed through month 60.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Mean visual acuity letter score (VALS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 362 included patients, 157 (43.4%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 68.9 (12.0) years. Outcome data were analyzed up to month 24 owing to substantial missing data at later visits. A significantly greater proportion of participants with HRVO than those with CRVO were Black (37% vs 11%). Treatment rates between months 12 to 23 were 0.36 (95% CI, 0.32-0.40) injections per month for patients with CRVO and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.19-0.36) for patients with HRVO (P = .11). The mean VALS from months 1 to 24 of an HRVO study eye exceeded that of a CRVO study eye by 5.5 (95% CI, 1.5-9.5; P = .01), consistent with the magnitude of the VALS difference between eyes with CRVO and HRVO at baseline. Eyes with CRVO presented at baseline with more macular edema than eyes with HRVO (difference in central subfield thickness [CST], 86 μm; 95% CI, 48-124; P < .001), with no difference in CST between the groups throughout months 1 to 24.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Black race was more prevalent among participants with HRVO than CRVO, and no differences were observed in the frequency of treatments for macular edema between eyes with CRVO and HRVO. Although eyes with CRVO presented with worse visual acuity and more macular edema on average than did eyes with HRVO, the magnitude of VALS improvement, central retinal thickness in response to anti-VEGF therapy, and treatment burden were similar between the groups.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35323843/,2022-11-27 11:20:39 PM
Increasing the probability of surviving loss of consciousness underwater when using a rebreather,"Paul Haynes, Paul Haynes",2016 Dec,"Re-circulating underwater breathing apparatus (rebreathers) have become increasingly popular amongst sport divers. In comparison to open-circuit scuba, rebreathers are complex life support equipment that incorporates many inherent failure modes and potential for human error. This individually or in combination can lead to an inappropriate breathing gas. Analysis of rebreather diving incidents suggests that inappropriate breathing gas is the most prevalent disabling agent. This can result in spontaneous loss of consciousness (LoC), water aspiration and drowning. Protecting the airway by maintaining the diver/rebreather oral interface may delay water aspiration following LoC underwater; the possibility of a successful rescue is, thus, increased. One means of protecting the airway following LoC underwater is the use of a full-face mask (FFM). However, such masks are complex and expensive; therefore, they have not been widely adopted by the sport diving community. An alternative to the FFM used extensively throughout the global military diving community is the mouthpiece retaining strap (MRS). A recent study documented 54 LoC events in military rebreather diving with only three consequent drownings; all divers were reported to be using a MRS. Even allowing for the concomitant use of a tethered diving partner system in most cases, the low number of fatalities in this large series is circumstantially supportive of the efficacy of the MRS. Despite drowning featuring as a final common pathway in the vast majority of rebreather fatalities, the MRS has not been widely adopted by the sport rebreather diving community.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27966205/,2022-11-27 11:20:40 PM
"Ship breaking or scuttling? A review of environmental, economic and forensic issues for decision support","Damien A Devault, Briac Beilvert, Peter Winterton, Damien A Devault, Briac Beilvert, Peter Winterton",2017 Nov,"In a globalized world, the world trade fleet plays a pivotal role in limiting transport costs. But, the management of obsolete ships is an acute problem, with most Ship Recycling Facilities (SRF) situated in developing countries. They are renowned for their controversial work and safety conditions and their environmental impact. Paradoxically, dismantlement is paid for by the shipowners in accordance with international conventions therefore it is more profitable for them to sell off ships destined for scrapping. Scuttling, the alternative to scrapping, is assessed in the present review to compare the cost/benefit ratios of the two approaches. Although scrapping provides employment and raw materials - but with environmental, health and safety costs - scuttling provides fisheries and diving tourism opportunities but needs appropriate management to avoid organic and metal pollution, introduction of invasive species and exacerbation of coastal erosion. It is also limited by appropriate bottom depth, ship type and number.

USN Treatment Table 9,"Dick Clarke, Dick Clarke",2017 Mar,"The United States Navy (USN) introduced Treatment Table 9 (USN TT9) in 1999. Its purpose is to provide a dosing protocol for cases of incomplete resolution of decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism following initial provision of USN Treatment Table 6 (USN TT6). It also can be used for several non-diving-related acute toxicities. Prior to USN TT9, it was and remains common to use USN Treatment Table 5 (USN TT5) for 'follow-up' therapy. An exception might be cases of severe residual neurologic injury, where some prefer to repeat USN TT6. The primary role of USN TT5, however, is for treatment of 'pain only' (Type 1) DCS that has fully resolved within 10 minutes of the first oxygen breathing period at 60 feet of seawater (fsw) (284 kPa). It is thought helpful here to point out that USN TT9 offers certain safety and operational advantages over USN TT5. As USN TT9 employs a maximum pressure of 243 kPa, a marked risk reduction exists for the injured diver in terms of CNS oxygen toxicity. Seizures are reported during treatment of divers using US Navy protocols, some as early as the second and in one case during the first oxygen breathing period at 284 kPa (Mitchell SJ, personal communication, 2016). The inside attendant likewise enjoys an iatrogenic DCS risk reduction. While air breathing exposure time at 60 fsw on USN TT5 appears modest at first blush, the table can be extended at 30 fsw (203 kPa) for two additional oxygen/air cycles. Such extensions result in a not inconsiderable total exposure time of three hours. DCS risk is also increased if the treatment represents a repetitive dive for the attendant, a not uncommon event. Given the ongoing occurrence of inside attendant DCS, in some cases career ending and twice with fatal outcome, its mitigation should be aggressively pursued (author's personal files). From an operational perspective, both treatment pressure and sequencing of oxygen/air breathing cycles during delivery of USN TT9 are essentially identical to that commonly employed during multiplace chamber delivery of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Accordingly, it is straightforward enough to incorporate follow-up decompression illness cases into daily clinical practice. Not having this dosing 'match', i.e., using USN TT5, might otherwise disrupt regularly scheduled cases. In my capacity as a medical claims adjudicator and clinical resource, I am involved, to varying degrees, in more than 300 cases of decompression illness each year. In those involving more than a single treatment, it is very much the exception, even after 17 years since its introduction, that USN TT9 is employed. The primary purpose of this correspondence, then, is to make mention of the advantages of USN TT9 and remind providers that it is indeed a standard of care in cases of incomplete relief for those who choose to base decompression injury management decisions on USN treatment procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28357827/,2022-11-27 11:20:41 PM
Thirty years of American cave diving fatalities,"Leah Potts, Peter Buzzacott, Petar Denoble, Leah Potts, Peter Buzzacott, Petar Denoble",2016 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      Cave divers enter an inherently dangerous environment that often includes little visibility, maze-like passageways and a ceiling of rock that prevents a direct ascent to the surface in the event of a problem.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Reports of cave diving fatality cases occurring between 01 July 1985 and 30 June 2015 collected by Divers Alert Network were reviewed. Training status, safety rules violated, relevancy of the violations, and root causes leading to death were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 161 divers who died were identified, 67 trained cave divers and 87 untrained. While the annual number of cave diving fatalities has steadily fallen over the last three decades, from eight to less than three, the proportion of trained divers among those fatalities has doubled. Data regarding trained cave divers were divided into two equal 15-year time periods. Trained cave divers who died in the most recent time period were older but little else differed. The most common cause of death was asphyxia due to drowning, preceded by running out of breathing gas, usually after getting lost owing to a loss of visibility caused by suspended silt. An overwhelming majority of the fatalities occurred in the state of Florida where many flooded caves are located.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Even with improvements in technology, the greatest hazards faced by cave divers remain unchanged. Efforts to develop preventative interventions to address these hazards should continue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723015/,2022-11-27 11:20:42 PM
Case Series of Arterial Gas Embolism Incidents in U.S. Navy Pressurized Submarine Escape Training From 2018 to 2019,"Mia Edgar, Michael A Franco, Hugh M Dainer, Mia Edgar, Michael A Franco, Hugh M Dainer",2021 May 3,"The goal of Pressurized Submarine Escape Training (PSET) is to prepare future submariners for the physical and mental challenges of escaping a disabled submarine and promote proper handling of the Beaufort Ltd Mk 11 Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment suit. Training participants are only permitted to enter PSET after strict health screening protocols have been met to optimize trainees' safety. Before PSET, trainees are given detailed, one-on-one instruction on proper ascent mechanics by specially trained Navy Dive instructors. Since the reinstatement of PSET by the U.S. Navy, four incidents of arterial gas embolism (AGE) have occurred in submarine trainees with a 10-year period (2009-2019). Of these four incidents, three were observed within a couple months of each other from 2018 to 2019. A comprehensive review of AGE history, epidemiology, dive physiology, pathophysiology, and management was completed. Prompted by the recent incidents relative to the low reported incidence rate of AGE in historical PSET training, reported potential risk factors were compared with better understand potential etiologies of AGE in already medically screened individuals.

Decision aid for the use of additional tests during the pre-employment medical examination (PEME) of seafarers,"Alf Magne Horneland, Suzanne Louise Stannard, Alf Magne Horneland, Suzanne Louise Stannard",2017,"No laboratory tests and imaging techniques are recommended for routine use in the ILO/IMO Guidelines on the Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) of Seafarers that form the basis for statutory certification. However, they are widely used as components of the PEME protocols developed by insurers, employers and national maritime authorities in an attempt to predict and reduce the risks from illness whilst working at sea. This may be justified on scientific, safety, economic or professional grounds. We propose a rational approach for deciding if and when tests can be justified for routine use in assessing a seafarer's fitness for work at sea. This is based on well-established methods for determining the validity of screening tests in public health as well as the seafarer demographics. We do not address the well-established use of similar tests where illness is suspected but only when they are used for routine PEME screening of all seafarers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28660611/,2022-11-27 11:20:44 PM
[Calculation of underwater decompression schedule for the simulated 100 m Trimix conventional diving and verification of the schedule with animal experiment],"Yang-yang Li, Lu Shi, Yan-meng Zhang, Chan-juan Xiao, Hong-tao Liu, Yang-yang Li, Lu Shi, Yan-meng Zhang, Chan-juan Xiao, Hong-tao Liu",2015 May,"Objective:
        
      
      To explore the underwater decompression schedule for 100 m Trimix conventional diving operations and evaluate its safety through a simulated rabbits Trimix conventional diving.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      According to the Haldane theory, the assumed time units, the classification of tissue compartments, the nitrogen super-saturation safety coefficient and the selection of methods used for the calculation of the simulated 100 m Trimix conventional diving schedule were properly selected, and the calculating method for the dive decompression schedule was thus firmly established. In our experiments, five tissue compartments were selected during the calculation of decompression schedule: 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 40 min and 75 min, and the nitrogen super-saturation safety coefficient was calculated by 1.6. Eight New Zealand rabbits were performed a simulated 100 m Trimix dive program which was established according to the Haldane theory, and eight rabbits for intact group. The tissues wet/dry ratio and ethology were detected and observed before and after the simulated diving to evaluate the safety of decompression schedule.
    


          Results:
        
      
      By using the developed underwater decompression schedule, abnormal ethology changes in rabbits could not be observed after compression and decompression to the surface; and the tissues wet/dry ratio of simulated diving rabbits had no significant changes compared with the intact group (P > 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The decompression schedule calculated by Haldane theory seemed to be safe and reliable, the diving breathing gas concentration did not cause oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis among the dive rabbits, and dive efficiency was greatly improved by using enriched oxygen gas in UPTD safety range during decompression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26387176/,2022-11-27 11:20:44 PM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2018 Edition: A Report on 2016 Diving Fatalities, Injuries, and Incidents [Internet]","Peter Buzzacott, Petar J. Denoble, Peter Buzzacott, Petar J. Denoble",,"The 2018 DAN Annual Diving Report is a summary of recreational scuba diving and freediving incidents, injuries and fatalities that occurred in 2016 in the U.S. or Canada or that involved U.S. or Canadian residents. DAN’s intention is for this annual publication to enhance awareness of dive injuries and give divers the insights they need to better avoid emergencies.
    

      
      DAN received notification of 169 deaths involving recreational scuba diving in 2016. The largest numbers of reported fatalities occurred in Florida and California, with 20 and 7 fatalities respectively.
    

      
      The geospatial distribution of the reported fatalities by region is: 72 in North America, 27 in Europe, 23 in Oceania, 19 in the Caribbean, 18 in Asia, 4 in South America, and 1 each in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, the Middle East and Central America. The location was unknown in two cases.
    

      
      Diving injury data analyzed in this report comes mainly from DAN’s Medical Services Call Center (MSCC) and its annual survey of hyperbaric chambers. Section 2, Diving Injuries, categorizes the types of injuries managed by DAN Medical Services and includes summaries of actual cases. In 2016, there were 10,320 calls or emails to the MSCC from divers who needed assistance, information or consultation; 59% of these cases were dive-related, and 41% were not. The most common dive-related health issues discussed during these calls were barotrauma, decompression sickness and marine envenomations.
    

      
      The Diving Incident Reporting System (DIRS) collects diving incident reports through the DAN website, www.DAN.org. Divers worldwide are encouraged to report any incidents that occur during dives via this system. Of the 102 incidents reported in 2016, 91 involved open-circuit scuba diving, 5 involved rebreather diving, and 6 involved breath-hold diving.
    

      
      In addition to the injury surveillance data collected by DAN in Durham, North Carolina, additional injury surveillance data analyzed in this report was contributed by DAN-affiliated agencies and other organizations around the world. Section 5 features reports from DAN Europe, DAN Japan and DAN Asia Pacific. Other organizations that reported their findings were the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), New Zealand Underwater Association, the Irish Underwater Council and the Underwater Council of British Columbia.
    

      
      Although scuba diving accidents can be fatal, many can be prevented with safe diving practices and by understanding how to identify hazards and avoid or mitigate the risks that cause accidents. The DAN Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Program enables divers and dive operators to recognize and avoid these risks; this program is described in Appendix B: DAN Operational Safety Programs.
    

      
      DAN exists to provide divers with the resources they need to make every dive accident- and injury-free. When accidents cannot be prevented, DAN is here to provide divers with emergency assistance no matter where in the world they are.
    

      
      With the support of all the DAN offices and contributors worldwide, DAN is committed to providing resources that will resonate with and be useful to divers everywhere.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021587/,2022-11-27 11:20:45 PM
Assessment of fitness for recreational scuba diving in candidates with asthma: a pilot study,"Amalie Ustrup, Signe Knag Pedersen, Charlotte Suppli Ulrik, Amalie Ustrup, Signe Knag Pedersen, Charlotte Suppli Ulrik",2020 Jan 15,"Background:
        
      
      Asthma may be regarded as a contraindication to scuba diving.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      A clinical algorithm to assess fitness to dive among individuals with asthma was developed and tested prospectively in clinical practice.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Cohort study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All patients with possible asthma referred to Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark, for assessment of fitness to dive over a 5-year period (2013-2017) were included. Fitness to dive was assessed by case history, spirometry and mannitol challenge test. All patients with ≥10% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (at any point during the challenge test) were offered step-up asthma therapy and rechallenge after at least 3 months. Patients with <10% decline in FEV1 after administration of a maximum dose of mannitol at the latest challenge were classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study cohort comprised 41 patients (24 men; mean age 33 years), of whom 71% and 63% of men and women, respectively, were treated with rescue bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid. After the first mannitol challenge test, 21 patients were classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving, of whom 16 were currently prescribed asthma medication. After step-up asthma therapy and rechallenge test, an additional seven patients were classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving. Overall, using this clinical algorithm, 28 (68%) of the referred patients were finally assessed as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Using a clinical algorithm with mannitol challenge to assess fitness to dive among patients with possible asthma and allowing a rechallenge test after step-up asthma therapy increased the proportion of individuals classified as having no medical contraindications to scuba diving. However, as this algorithm has so far not been evaluated against actual scuba diving safety, further studies are clearly needed before it can be implemented with confidence for use in clinical practice.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      An algorithm to assess fitness for scuba diving among individuals with possible asthma using bronchial challenge test, with the option of step-up asthma therapy and rechallenge for reassessment, has been developed for clinical use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32095266/,2022-11-27 11:20:45 PM
The utility and safety of hypoxia experiences for rebreather divers,"Simon J Mitchell, Hayden M Green, Stacey A Reading, Nicholas Gant, Simon J Mitchell, Hayden M Green, Stacey A Reading, Nicholas Gant",2019 Jun 30,"Background:
        
      
      Aircrew training often includes an hypoxic experience aimed at improving symptom recognition and self-rescue in a subsequent hypoxic event. Similar training has been advocated for rebreather divers. We investigated the effect of a prior hypoxic experience on actual and perceived cognitive function during subsequent hypoxia and measured the physiological responses to severe progressive hypoxia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-five subjects underwent two hypoxic hypoxia experiences (trials one and two) approximately five weeks apart. Subjects breathed 5.5% oxygen whilst performing a playing card recognition test. The primary endpoint was the time taken to make three consecutive errors in the card recognition test (time of useful consciousness, TUC). Secondary endpoints were the total number of errors made, accuracy of error recollection and physiological variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean (SD) TUC was 166 seconds (37) and 169 s (35), and subjects made 8.9 (2.4) and 7.8 (2.0) errors in trials one and two respectively. Error recall was identical between trials with participants failing to recall 6 (3) and 6 (2) errors made in trials one and two respectively. Across both trials mean nadir arterial blood and cerebral oxygen saturations were 52% and 49% respectively. The mean (SD) increase in heart rate was 42 (16) beats·min⁻¹.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An hypoxic experience did not improve cognitive performance or subject insight into performance in a second exposure five weeks later. Hypoxia imposes a significant physiological stress which may be hazardous in unscreened, non-medically supervised subjects. Hypoxia experience training is not recommended for rebreather divers at this time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31177517/,2022-11-27 11:20:46 PM
Recreational diving-related injury insurance claims among Divers Alert Network Japan members: Retrospective analysis of 321 cases from 2010 to 2014,"Yasushi Kojima, Akiko Kojima, Yumi Niizeki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita, Yasushi Kojima, Akiko Kojima, Yumi Niizeki, Kazuyoshi Yagishita",2020 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Monitoring trends in diving-related injuries enables implementation of effective safety measures. Divers Alert Network Japan (DAN Japan) membership includes insurance covering recreational diving-related injuries and fatalities. Use of claim data provides both a known denominator and demographic data about injured members.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study analysed 325 insurance claims reported to DAN Japan from 2010 to 2014. Four fatalities were excluded, leaving 321 claims for analysis. Claimants were divided into three age groups: young adults (< 40 years); middle-aged (40-59 years) and older adults (≥ 60 years). The total injury claims rate (ICR), decompression illness (DCI) rate (DCR) and trauma rate (TCR) were calculated. Differences between the sexes within each age group were analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The total number of DAN Japan member-years in the period was 80,617, with a mean age of 45 years. Claims were made by 153 males and 168 females with a mean and median age of 46 years. Trauma was the most frequent reason for a claim (113 cases, 35%), followed by DCI (109 cases, 34%). The ICR (per 104 member-years) was 39.8 (95% confidence interval 35.5 to 44.2) and the TCR was 14.0 (11.4 to 16.6). For every age group, the ICR and TCR were significantly higher for females than males. The DCR was 13.5 (11.0 to 16.1) and did not significantly differ between the sexes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The incidence of trauma-related diving injuries exceeds that of claims related to DCI. Females appear to have a higher risk of injury than the general diving population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557409/,2022-11-27 11:20:48 PM
Efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen treatment in SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pneumonia: a systematic review,"Sylvain Boet, Cole Etherington, George Djaiani, Andrea C Tricco, Lindsey Sikora, Rita Katznelson, Sylvain Boet, Cole Etherington, George Djaiani, Andrea C Tricco, Lindsey Sikora, Rita Katznelson",2021 Sep 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The need for intubation and mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 patients is associated with high mortality rates and places a substantial burden on the healthcare system. There is a strong pathophysiological rationale suggesting that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), a low-risk and non-invasive treatment, may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aimed to explore the potential effectiveness and safety of HBOT for treating patients with COVID-19.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from December 2019 to February 2021, without language restrictions. The grey literature was searched via an internet search engine and targeted website and database searches. Reference lists of included studies were searched. Independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Data were summarised descriptively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Six publications (one cohort study, five case reports/series) met the inclusion criteria with a total of 37 hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients treated with HBOT. Of these 37 patients, the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation and in-hospital survival were assessed for 26 patients across three studies. Of these 26 patients, intubation and mechanical ventilation were not required for 24, and 23 patients survived. No serious adverse events of HBOT in COVID-19 patients were reported. No randomised trials have been published.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Limited and weak evidence from non-randomised studies including one propensity-matched cohort study suggests HBOT is safe and may be a promising intervention to optimise treatment and outcomes in hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients. Randomised controlled studies are urgently needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34547778/,2022-11-27 11:20:49 PM
Dysbaric osteonecrosis in diving fisherman: a case report,"Seher Kurtul, Nejdiye Güngördü, Seher Kurtul, Nejdiye Güngördü",2022 Aug 25,"Dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON) is defined as avascular bone necrosis, usually involving specific parts of the long bones, which is seen in divers or compressed-air workers due to exposure to pressure. We describe a case of DON in an artisanal diving fisherman working underwater for many years. Methods: A 48-year-old male case was admitted to the occupational disease outpatient with left shoulder and arm pain for 1-2 years. Since the age of 20, he has been artisanal diving fishing with a hookah at a depth of 20-25 meters in the sea. In 2011, he received hyperbaric oxygen therapy for widespread pain in the whole body due to decompression sickness (DCS). In the case's left shoulder joint x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging, degenerative changes in the acromioclavicular joint and signal changes consistent with osteonecrosis starting from the subcortical area of the humeral head and extending to the proximal shaft of the humerus were observed. Conclusions: DON is among the most common long-term pathologies in professional divers. In Turkey, as in our case, not applying safe decompression procedures and unsafe diving practices are common among diving fishers. In studies, the frequency of exposure to pressure, duration and depth of dive, insufficient decompression, formation of DCS and increasing age were associated with DON. Today, DON remains an occupational hazard with significant medical and social consequences. Diving fishers should be informed about the sequelae of DCS and trained on the safety measures to be taken.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36006094/,2022-11-27 11:20:49 PM
[Effect of Nutrient Loadings on the Regulation of Water Nitrogen and Phosphorus by Vallisneria natans and Its Photosynthetic Fluorescence Characteristics],"Yi-Wen Zhou, Xiao-Guang Xu, Rui-Ming Han, Xiao-Hong Zhou, De-You Feng, Zhi-Chun Li, Guo-Xiang Wang, Yi-Wen Zhou, Xiao-Guang Xu, Rui-Ming Han, Xiao-Hong Zhou, De-You Feng, Zhi-Chun Li, Guo-Xiang Wang",2018 Mar 8,"Submerged macrophytes are an important component of aquatic ecosystems. During the growing period, submerged macrophytes can absorb nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients to reduce pollution loadings. Shoots of submerged macrophytes can also promote the adhesion of suspended substances in water, reducing the turbidity. The release of nutrients in sediments can be suppressed by its root system, and the resuspension of sediments caused by disturbance of winds and waves can also be resisted. The role of submerged macrophytes in ecological restoration of eutrophic lakes has attracted widespread attention. In 1960, the submerged plants Vallisneria natans and Potamogeton malaianus had been the dominant species in East Taihu. However after 2002, Nymphoides peltatum, Elodea nattalii, P. malaianus, etc. have gradually taken over the dominant roles along with significant elevations of nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Nutrients in water are not the only key factors causing eutrophication of water bodies; the nutrient source for submerged plant growth affect both the purification efficiency and the photosynthetic characteristics of submerged macrophytes. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations can inhibit the photosynthetic physiological activities of submerged macrophytes, affecting the succession of aquatic vegetation. In addition, under high nutrient conditions, the competition from periphytic algae and planktonic algae may also directly poison submerged macrophytes, leading to its degradation and disappearance. Systematic studies on the regulation and photosynthetic fluorescence response mechanism of submerged macrophytes to varied nutrient loadings are helpful in revealing their relationships. The seedlings of submerged macrophyte V. natans were transplanted in a laboratory mesocosm to study the effect of nutrient loadings on its regulation of water nitrogen and phosphorus. Three nitrogen and phosphorus loadings from low, medium, and high levels derived from nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate were setup as the aquatic medium for the plant growth. Twelve harvests were carried out to determine the evolution of nutrient removal performance of V. natans. Its photosynthetic fluorescence characteristics were measured by a pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer (Diving-PAM). Results showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus adsorption abilities of V. natans were gradually enhanced with the increase of nutrient concentrations in the range of TN ≤ 12 mg·L-1 and TP ≤ 1.0 mg·L-1. In the treatment of high nutrient concentrations (TN=12 mg·L-1 and TP=1.0 mg·L-1), the removal rates of nitrogen and phosphorus reached more than 95%. V. natans preferentially absorbed ammonium nitrogen when its concentration was high. The medium nutrient concentrations (TN:8-12 mg·L-1 and TP:0.6-1.0 mg·L-1) did not significantly affect the Fv/Fm ratio of leaves. However, the low nutrient concentrations (TN=3 mg·L-1 and TP=0.3 mg·L-1) could improve the Fv/Fm ratio of leaves and were beneficial for the growth of V. natans. The inhibition of photosynthetic activity and light tolerance were enhanced with the increase in nutrient concentrations. The photosynthetic activity of V. natans gradually recovered with no significant changes in the capacity for light harvesting, when the nutrient concentrations gradually decreased in the water. Our results indicate that the high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings indeed hamper the photosynthetic capacity, which may subsequently restrain the maintenance of the dominance of V. natans in the submerged macrophyte communities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29965462/,2022-11-27 11:20:50 PM
Addressing the taboo of medical error through IGBOs: I got burnt once!,"Anda Dumitrescu, C Anthony Ryan, Anda Dumitrescu, C Anthony Ryan",2014 Apr,"Background:
        
      
      An I Got Burnt Once (IGBO) is a near-miss or actual clinical event, related to patient safety, that leaves a lasting impact on the health professional (HP) involved. The purpose of this study was to collect and categorize IGBOs from a variety of pediatric HPs and to determine whether the individual's clinical practice was altered as a result.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Semistructured interviews involved recollection of an IGBO and subsequent changes in clinical practice. The IGBOs were classified into one of the seven Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) roles and outcome of the event.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 38 pediatric HPs approached (25 doctors and 13 female nurses), 35 recalled an IGBO. Most (74 %) were classified to the CanMEDS Medical Expert role (with subcategorization into diagnostics (37 %), treatment (34 %), and clinical management (31 %) followed by communicator (14 %) and collaborator (12 %) roles). Half (55 %) of the respondents considered the IGBO event to be potentially life threatening event to the patient, resulting in no harm (63 %), disability (14 %), and fatality in 17 % of the cases. Most respondents (92 %) stated that IGBOs affected their medical practice for months and sometimes years after the event.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most practitioners can recall an IGBO in their clinical practice. IGBOs may be a potential source of medical risk avoidance and reduction strategies, and worthy of further investigation by ""deep dives"" or root cause analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24240665/,2022-11-27 11:20:51 PM

Only incidents diagnosed as IPE by specialist diving physicians or pathologists with experience in the investigation of diving accidents were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one IPE incidents in divers from Oceania were documented. There were two surface snorkelers, 22 scuba air divers and seven nitrox divers, which included three closed-circuit rebreathers (CCR). The mean (SD) age was 53 (12) years, 58% of victims were females, and the average dive profile was to a maximum depth of 19 msw for 25 minutes. Six victims (19%) had previous episodes of IPE. There were nine recorded fatalities in this cohort. Medical comorbidities were recorded in 68%, with 42% being cardiac. The latter included valvular disease in 29%, transient cardiomyopathies in 26% and dysrhythmias in 16%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      IPE was more likely in middle-aged females, in experienced divers, and during ascent or after surfacing. Commonly reported associations such as exertion, stress, cold exposure, negative inspiratory pressure, hypertension, overhydration, tight wetsuit, aspiration and certain medications were identified. This series supports the hypothesis that the elderly IPE subjects are likely to have comorbidities and be susceptible to IPE recurrences and fatalities unless the contributing factors can be identified and addressed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31683357/,2022-11-27 11:20:51 PM
On diver thermal status and susceptibility to decompression sickness,"Wayne A Gerth, Wayne A Gerth",2015 Sep,"In a recent Letter to the Editor, Clarke, et al, indicated that divers who deliberately chill themselves on a dive to reduce risk of decompression sickness (DCS) may be misinterpreting our 2007 Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) report. Indeed, we did not advocate that divers should risk hypothermia on bottom to reduce risk of DCS, nor do we dispute the authors' overall admonition to avoid diving cold unnecessarily. However, Clarke, et al, imply more generally that results of our study are not applicable to recreational or technical divers because the dives we tested were atypical of dives undertaken by such divers. We wish to clarify that our study does have implications for recreational and technical divers, implications that should not be ignored. The dives we tested were not intended to be typical of dives undertaken in any actual operational context. Instead, we chose to expose divers to temperatures at the extremes of their thermal tolerance in order to ensure that effects of diver thermal status on DCS susceptibility would be found if such effects existed. Our initial test dive profile provided appreciable time both on bottom and during decompression to allow any differential thermal effects during these two dive phases to manifest, while affording a baseline risk of DCS that could be altered by thermal effects without exposing subjects to inordinately high risks of DCS. Our results strongly indicate that the optimal diver thermal conditions for mitigation of DCS risk or minimization of decompression time entail remaining cool during gas uptake phases of a dive and warm during off-gassing phases. While the dose-response characteristics of our observed thermal effects are almost certainly non-linear in both exposure temperature and duration, it is only reasonable to presume that the effects vary monotonically with these factors. We have no reason to presume that such responses and effects under less extreme conditions would be in directions opposite to those found under the conditions we tested. Similarly, responses to thermal exposures even more extreme than we tested might not be larger than the responses we observed, but it would be unwise to ignore the trends in our results under some unfounded presumption that the effects reverse with changes in thermal conditions beyond those tested. Finally, thermal effects on bottom and during decompression in dives to depths other than the 120 feet of sea water (fsw) or 150 fsw depths of the dives we tested are unlikely to be qualitatively different from those observed in our tested dives. The original question has therefore been answered: chill on bottom decreases DCS susceptibility while chill during decompression increases DCS susceptibility. Under conditions encountered by recreational or technical divers, the only open issue is arguably magnitudes of effects, not directions. Neither does lack of technology to control thermal status during a dive render our study results inapplicable. It only renders the diver unable to actively optimize his or her thermal exposure to minimize DCS risk or decompression obligation. Effects of diver thermal status on bottom hold regardless of whether the dive has a decompression long enough for a thermal effect to manifest in the decompression phase of the dive. We pointed out that US Navy decompression tables have historically been developed and validated with test dives in which divers were cold and working during bottom phases and cold and resting during decompression phases. Thus, our results indicate that it is not prudent for very warm divers to challenge the US Navy no-stop limits. However, becoming deliberately chilled on bottom only to remain cold during any ensuing decompression stops is similarly ill-advised. We agree with Clarke et al. that relative conservatism of some dive computer algorithms or alternative decompression tables, or the depth and time roundups necessary to determine table-based prescriptions, work in the diver's favour, but note that diving any profile to a shorter bottom time is a ready means to reduce the risk of DCS - i.e., enhance safety - without compromising comfort. Any active diver heating is best limited while on bottom to a minimal level required to safely complete on-bottom tasks, and dialled up only during decompression. Diver warming during decompression should not be so aggressive as to risk heat stress, and care should be taken to ensure that divers remain hydrated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415073/,2022-11-27 11:20:52 PM

Ginsenosides are the major components of SMI. To monitor the exposure level of SMI during long-term treatment, a 6-month toxicokinetic experiment was performed. Twenty-four beagle dogs were dived into four groups (n = 6 in each group): a control group (0.9% NaCl solution) and three SMI groups (2, 6 or 3 mg/kg). The dogs were i.v. infused with vehicle or SMI daily for 180 d. Blood samples for analysis were collected at specific time points as follows: pre-dose (0 h); at 10, 30, and 60 min during infusion; and at 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, and 300 min post-administration. Concentrations of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, and Rg1 in the plasma were determined simultaneously by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental parameters were further calculated and analyzed. Significant differences were found between the kinetic behavior of 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-type (PPD-type) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol-type (PPT-type) ginsenosides. Increasing in the exposure level of PPD-type ginsenosides was observed in dogs during the experiment. Therefore, PPD-type ginsenosides are closely related to the immunity modulation effect of SMI. Increased PPD-type ginsenoside exposure level may present potential toxicity and induce drug-drug interaction risks during SMI administration. As such, PPD-type ginsenoside accumulation must be carefully monitored in future SMI research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27840091/,2022-11-27 11:20:53 PM

To address the challenge of interference with detection signals from large molecular contaminants and colored substances in complex food matrices, we had dived into easy-to-use antifouling swabs, which were modified with sodium sulfonyl methacrylate (SBMA) by photopolymerization and incubated with Salmonella-specific aptamers. Surface modification of SBMA showed the antifouling property of the swab, and the aptamer collected Salmonella in the sample. Gold-palladium (Au-Pd) nanoparticles with photothermal properties were combined with the aptamer by freezing technique to identify Salmonella on the swab and output the signal. In addition, we used a simple ""Snake-Eye"" device, which consists of laser transmitter, infrared thermometer and smartphone to quantitatively identify Salmonella in colored foodstuffs. The linear detection range was 102-107 CFU mL-1, and the detection limit was 13.20 CFU mL-1.

The Analysis of Materials Strength Used in the Construction of the Flexible Underwater Bell-Batychron,"Grzegorz Rutkowski, Paweł Kołakowski, Katarzyna Panasiuk, Grzegorz Rutkowski, Paweł Kołakowski, Katarzyna Panasiuk",2022 Nov 3,"Batychron is a flexible underwater bell patented by the Gdynia Maritime University as a device used in hydro-technics engineering for underwater transport and diving while maintaining the safety of human life. This study aims to present the methods and results of strength tests and the conducted analysis of the selection of the most appropriate method of joining thermoplastic polyurethane film (TPU) and polypropylene belts for underwater use to obtain a device with a specific buoyancy force. A universal testing machine with a hydraulic drive was used for the tests. Various methods of joining polypropylene belts were tested to select the most favourable in terms of strength properties. For this purpose, two types of materials were selected: the TE324 polyester belt and the TS501_50 style belt. Various connection methods have been used: without seams; zig-zag stitch, straight cross; cross stitch, straight longitudinal; cross stitch, straight transverse, in order to select a joint with the highest strength parameters. In addition, the tensile strength of individual types of belts was tested. The methods of joining the TPU film were verified. The obtained results allowed us to determine that the strongest bond of TE324 material is a straight, longitudinal cross stitch. This is related to the load distribution in the belts tested in laboratory conditions, but also reflected in their practical application. Thanks to the results obtained, it was possible to select the optimal methods of joining (connection) and the construction of Batychron.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36363360/,2022-11-27 11:20:55 PM

This investigation examined core temperature responses to fatiguing, fully-immersed exercise in extremely warm waters. Twenty-one male U.S. Navy divers (body mass, 87.3 ± 12.3 kg) were monitored during rest and fatiguing exercise while fully-immersed in four different water temperatures (Tw): 34.4, 35.8, 37.2, and 38.6°C (Tw34.4, Tw35.8, Tw37.2, and Tw38.6 respectively). Participants exercised on an underwater cycle ergometer until volitional fatigue or core temperature limits were reached. Core body temperature and heart rate were monitored continuously. Trial performance time decreased significantly as water temperature increased (Tw34.4, 174 ± 12 min; Tw35.8, 115 ± 13 min; Tw37.2, 50 ± 13 min; Tw38.6, 34 ± 14 min). Peak core body temperature during work was significantly lower in Tw34.4 water (38.31 ± 0.49°C) than in warmer temperatures (Tw35.8, 38.60 ± 0.55°C; Tw37.2, 38.82 ± 0.76°C; Tw38.6, 38.97 ± 0.65°C).

Health conditions among Navy divers at end of service: a retrospective cohort study,"Brian J Maguire, Linda M Hughes, Douglas C McAdams, Michael Gilbert, Robert Nordness, Brian J Maguire, Linda M Hughes, Douglas C McAdams, Michael Gilbert, Robert Nordness",2022 First Quarter,"Purpose:
        
      
      To identify the most prevalent health conditions among divers during their last year of Navy service.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For this retrospective descriptive study we used data from the Dive Jump Reporting System to identify 4,623 active-duty divers who separated between 2008 and 2018. Medical records, dive histories, and personnel files were merged, linked and analyzed at the individual level.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On average, 420 divers separated each year. Among the separating divers, 99% were male, 26% were aged 25 to 29 years old with a mean age of 35 (SD = 9, range 18 to 65). The major medical categories with the highest numbers of divers affected were: musculoskeletal system diseases (prevalence rate (PR) = 515.2 per 1,000 divers/year); nervous system (PR = 411.9); injury and poisonings (PR = 249.8); and mental disorders (PR = 237.3). Of the 50 specific conditions that affected the most divers the top four were joint disorders (PR = 34.5), disorders of refraction and accommodation (PR = 30.1), back disorders (PR = 26.8) and organic sleep disorders (PR = 21.6). Compared to divers with fewer than 29 dives, divers with 49-plus dives were about twice as likely to have diagnoses related to symptoms involving head and neck.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study found high rates of conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders, joint and back disorders, and some mental health related disorders. Special warfare divers have high rates of hearing loss, and other disorders of ear. The results show the need and to develop and implement group-specific mitigation programs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35226973/,2022-11-27 11:20:56 PM
Memory and metacognition in dangerous situations: investigating cognitive impairment from gas narcosis in undersea divers,"Malcolm Hobbs, Philip A Higham, Wendy Kneller, Malcolm Hobbs, Philip A Higham, Wendy Kneller",2014 Jun,"Objective:
        
      
      The current study tested whether undersea divers are able to accurately judge their level of memory impairment from inert gas narcosis.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Inert gas narcosis causes a number of cognitive impairments, including a decrement in memory ability. Undersea divers may be unable to accurately judge their level of impairment, affecting safety and work performance.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In two underwater field experiments, performance decrements on tests of memory at 33 to 42 m were compared with self-ratings of impairment and resolution. The effect of depth (shallow [I-II m] vs. deep [33-42 m]) was measured on free-recall (Experiment I; n = 41) and cued-recall (Experiment 2; n = 39) performance, a visual-analogue self-assessment rating of narcotic impairment, and the accuracy of judgements-of-learning JOLs).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both free- and cued-recall were significantly reduced in deep, compared to shallow, conditions. This decrement was accompanied by an increase in self-assessed impairment. In contrast, resolution (based on JOLs) remained unaffected by depth. The dissociation of memory accuracy and resolution, coupled with a shift in a self-assessment of impairment, indicated that divers were able to accurately judge their decrease in memory performance at depth.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These findings suggest that impaired self-assessment and resolution may not actually be a symptom of narcosis in the depth range of 33 to 42 m underwater and that the divers in this study were better equipped to manage narcosis than prior literature suggested. The results are discussed in relation to implications for diver safety and work performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25029895/,2022-11-27 11:20:57 PM

Physicians are expected to provide return-to-diving recommendations after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection based upon the best available evidence, often drawn from experience with other, similar diseases. Scuba diving presents unique physiologic challenges to the body secondary to immersion, increased pressure and increased work of breathing. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are still unknown, but if they are proven to be similar to other coronaviruses (such as Middle East respiratory syndrome or SARS-CoV-1) they may result in long-term pulmonary and cardiac sequelae that impact divers' ability to safely return to scuba diving. This review considers available literature and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 as it relates to diving fitness, including current recommendations for similar illnesses, and proposes guidelines for evaluation of divers after COVID-19. The guidelines are based upon best available evidence about COVID-19, as well as past experience with determination of diving fitness.

Using Underwater Pulse Oximetry in Freediving to Extreme Depths to Study Risk of Hypoxic Blackout and Diving Response Phases,"Eric Mulder, Erika Schagatay, Arne Sieber, Eric Mulder, Erika Schagatay, Arne Sieber",2021 Apr 1,"Deep freediving exposes humans to hypoxia and dramatic changes in pressure. The effect of depth on gas exchange may enhance risk of hypoxic blackout (BO) during the last part of the ascent. Our aim was to investigate arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) in shallow and deep freedives, central variables, which have rarely been studied underwater in deep freediving. Four male elite competitive freedivers volunteered to wear a newly developed underwater pulse oximeter for continuous monitoring of SpO2 and HR during self-initiated training in the sea. Two probes were placed on the temples, connected to a recording unit on the back of the freediver. Divers performed one ""shallow"" and one ""deep"" constant weight dive with fins. Plethysmograms were recorded at 30 Hz, and SpO2 and HR were extracted. Mean ± SD depth of shallow dives was 19 ± 3 m, and 73 ± 12 m for deep dives. Duration was 82 ± 36 s in shallow and 150 ± 27 s in deep dives. All divers desaturated more during deeper dives (nadir 55 ± 10%) compared to shallow dives (nadir 80 ± 22%) with a lowest SpO2 of 44% in one deep dive. HR showed a ""diving response,"" with similar lowest HR of 42 bpm in shallow and deep dives; the lowest value (28 bpm) was observed in one shallow dive. HR increased before dives, followed by a decline, and upon resurfacing a peak after which HR normalized. During deep dives, HR was influenced by the level of exertion across different diving phases; after an initial drop, a second HR decline occurred during the passive ""free fall"" phase. The underwater pulse oximeter allowed successful SpO2 and HR monitoring in freedives to 82 m depth - deeper than ever recorded before. Divers' enhanced desaturation during deep dives was likely related to increased exertion and extended duration, but the rapid extreme desaturation to below 50% near surfacing could result from the diminishing pressure, in line with the hypothesis that risk of hypoxic BO may increase during ascent. Recordings also indicated that the diving response is not powerful enough to fully override the exercise-induced tachycardia during active swimming. Pulse oximetry monitoring of essential variables underwater may be an important step to increase freediving safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33868018/,2022-11-27 11:20:59 PM
Is more complex safer in the case of bail-out rebreathers for extended range cave diving?,"Derek B Covington, Charlotte Sadler, Anthony Bielawski, Gareth Lock, Andrew Pitkin, Derek B Covington, Charlotte Sadler, Anthony Bielawski, Gareth Lock, Andrew Pitkin",2022 Mar 31,"Nowhere is redundancy more indispensable than extended range cave diving. Training and practice in this discipline ensure divers are equipped with backup regulators, gauges, lights, and adequate breathing gas for a safe exit, emergencies, and decompression. Depending on penetration distances and depth, open circuit cave diving may require carrying more gas cylinders than can be logistically managed by the diver themselves while maintaining safe gas supply margins. Consequently, divers are forced to either stage cylinders in the cave prior to the dive or rely on resupply from support divers. Both scenarios have significant drawbacks. Due to the improved efficiency of breathing gas utilisation and other advantages, closed circuit rebreathers (CCR) have enabled extended range cave diving. With increasing depths, penetration distances, and bottom times, these divers must also plan for an increasing amount of open circuit bail-out gas in the event of CCR failure. Staged cylinders have traditionally been utilised, but this strategy has limitations due to the advanced dives needed to place them and equipment degradation due to prolonged water immersion, which can often result in cylinder and regulator corrosion with consequent leakage of contents over time. Consequently, a growing number of CCR divers are foregoing open-circuit bailout altogether by carrying an additional CCR system for bailout. Although these bailout rebreathers may facilitate further exploration and have certain advantages, the risks of diving with two complex machines remain to be clearly defined.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35313373/,2022-11-27 11:21:00 PM

      Snorkelling is a popular aquatic activity which may result in fatal and non-fatal drowning. However, little is known about the scale of injury, factors impacting risk and strategies for prevention. This review assesses the current literature on snorkelling-related drowning with the aim of assessing available data, improving safety recommendations and reducing the global mortality burden.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature in English, Spanish and Portuguese language published between 1 January 1980 and 31 October 2020 was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. CINAHL Complete, Embase, Medline (Ovid), PubMed, SafetyLit, SportDiscus and grey literature were searched to identify studies reporting the incidence of fatal and non-fatal snorkelling-related drowning, or associated risk factors, prevention strategies, treatments or casualty characteristics. Quality was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-three studies were included (26 reporting population data, 17 case series), of which 27 (62.8%) studies reported data from Australia. Incidence was reported as about 8% of total ocean-related drownings. Case series documented 144 fatalities over 17 years. Frequent casualty characteristics include male (82.6%), pre-existing heart disease (59.4%), tourists (73%) who were inexperienced (71.0%), and lack of a buddy system (89.6%). Two at-risk profiles identified were older adult tourists with pre-existing medical conditions and local, experienced spearfishers. Twenty-two expert recommendations were developed to improve the safety of snorkellers related to individuals, tourism companies, government agencies and diving organisations.

However, in diving medicine it is unclear whether an LLN of 2.5% (LLN-2.5) or 5% (LLN-5) in healthy subjects constitutes an appropriate cut-off.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All PFTs performed at the Royal Netherlands Navy Diving Medical Centre between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2021 resulting in a forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and/or FEV1/FVC with a Z-score between -1.64 (LLN-5) and -1.96 (LLN-2.5) were included. Records were screened for additional tests, referral to a pulmonary specialist, results of radiological imaging, and fitness to dive.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis of 2,108 assessments in 814 subjects showed that 83 subjects, 74 men and nine women, mean age 32.4 (SD 8.2) years and height 182 (7.0) cm, had an FVC, FEV1 and/or FEV1/FVC with Z-scores between -1.64 and -1.96. Of these 83 subjects, 35 (42%) underwent additional tests, 77 (93%) were referred to a pulmonary specialist and 31 (37%) underwent high-resolution CT-imaging. Ten subjects (12%) were declared 'unfit to dive' for various reasons. Information from their medical history could have identified these individuals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Use of LLN-2.5 rather than LLN-5 for FEV1/FVC in asymptomatic individuals reduces additional investigations and referrals to a pulmonary specialist without missing important diagnoses, provided a thorough medical history is taken. Adoption of LLN-2.5 could save resources spent on diving medical assessments and protect subjects from harmful side effects associated with additional investigations, while maintaining an equal level of safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897602/,2022-11-27 11:21:02 PM
Exercise-Related Effects on Executive Functions During a Simulated Underwater Extravehicular Activity,"Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Tobias Vogt, Fabian Steinberg, Fabian Möller, Uwe Hoffmann, Tobias Vogt, Fabian Steinberg",2021 Aug 2,"Objective:
        
      
      Investigation of cognitive performance during extravehicular activities (EVAs) in a space-analog setting.
    


          Background:
        
      
      EVAs performed by humans in microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS) call for high cognitive performance during upper-body workload. Higher cardiovascular demands interact with cognitive performance, but no knowledge exists about EVA's special requirements. This study simulates EVA-training underwater to investigate its effects on the executive functions inhibition and switching.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In a counterbalanced crossover design, 16 divers (age: 28 ± 2.4 years; eight females) performed two conditions (i.e., EVA vs. Inactivity [INACT]) in 3-5 m submersion (diving gear; not in a space-suit). EVA included 30 min of moderate-, followed by 30 min of high-intensity upper-body exercise intervals, paired with EVA-specific cognitive-motor tasks. INACT included no exercise in submersion and neutral buoyancy. Both conditions included cognitive testing at pre, mid (after the first 30 min), and post (after the second 30 min) on a tablet computer. Reaction times (RTs) and response accuracy (ACC) were calculated for both tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ACC was significantly lower during EVA compared with INACT for inhibition (post: p = .009) and switching (mid: p = .019) at post (p = .005). RTs for inhibition were significantly faster during EVA (p = .022; ηp 2 = 0.320).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Specific physical exercise, intensity, duration, and tasks performed during the EVA might differently affect the exercise-cognition interaction and need further investigation, especially for future long-term space travel.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Future research might serve to improve mission success and safety for EVAs and long-term space travel.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34340575/,2022-11-27 11:21:03 PM
Severe carbon monoxide poisonings in scuba divers: Asia-Pacific cases and causation,"John Lippmann, Ian Millar, John Lippmann, Ian Millar",2022 Third Quarter,"Aim:
        
      
      Reports of fatal incidents in recreational scuba divers from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning are rare. This study aimed to identify scuba fatalities in the Asia-Pacific region caused by breathing-gas contamination to better understand the likely sources of contamination and reduce such preventable deaths.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A hand search of Project Stickybeak reports, subsequent Australian fatality series reports, and of published New Zealand diving fatality reports and associated data was conducted, as well as key word searches of the National Coronial Information System for scuba fatalities in Australia and New Zealand. Cases identified were matched with the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation diving fatality database. Available reports were examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four scuba deaths resulting from CO poisoning were identified from 645 scuba fatalities, including one report from each of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Maldives. A near-fatal incident was also identified in Indonesia. Two of the fatal incidents and the near-fatal incident involved internal combustion engine exhaust gases from the compressor system or elsewhere entering the air intake. Two deaths likely resulted from combustion within compressor systems.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Scuba fatalities from CO poisoning are uncommon, albeit likely under-reported. Sources of CO include exhaust gases entering the compressor and CO production by pyrolysis or gasification within the compressor or its filter system. Preventive measures include proper installation (including positioning of the air intake relative to combustion exhaust), appropriate maintenance, fitting of pressure-maintaining valves and avoidance of overheating. Formal training of compressor operators, improved diver education, mandatory requirements for installation compliance assessments, safety inspections, and the use of carbon monoxide alarms are recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36001567/,2022-11-27 11:21:04 PM
Re: Don't dive cold when you don't have to,"Neal W Pollock, Neal W Pollock",2015 Sep,"The letter by Clarke et al unfortunately misrepresents the work at the US Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) to which it refers, and delivers a confused picture of the physiological impact of thermal status on decompression stress. A series of earlier reports outline the importance of thermal status. Being warm during a dive results in higher post-dive Doppler bubble scores. Hot water suits are associated with a higher rate of decompression sickness (DCS) than passively insulated drysuits. Post-dive cooling can prolong the risk window for developing symptoms of skin bends.The NEDU chamber study provided an elegant design to further assess the impact of thermal stress. Dives to 37 msw (120 fsw) were divided into descent/bottom and ascent/stop phases, prolonging the latter so that bottom times could be increased if results allowed without compromising the experimental structure. The water temperature was held at either 36 °C (97 °F; 'warm') or 27 °C (80 °F; 'cold'). The 'warm/cold' exposure, with a bottom time of 30 minutes, yielded a DCS rate of 22% (7/32 subject-exposures). The 'cold/warm' bottom time was increased to 70 minutes and still yielded a DCS rate of only 1.3% (2/158). Even if the effects are exaggerated by the prolonged ascent/stop phase, the dramatic results demand serious attention. Contrary to the claim made by Clarke et al in their letter, the high temperature employed in the NEDU study could almost certainly be maintained at the skin by a number of active heating garments available to the diving public. Hot water suits are not required for the effect; and the 'cold' study temperature (better described as 'cool') is clearly well within the range experienced by divers. The statement by Clarke et al that ""the Navy uses their extensive mathematical expertise to select the one dive profile that, in their estimation, is the most likely to identify a difference in decompression risk..."" is frankly baffling. Use of a single dive depth in no way invalidates the relevance to other dive profiles. Similarly, it is not reasonable to characterize skin temperatures lower than those produced in the study as ""venturing into the unknown"" and thereby invalidating the results. Scientific method does encourage the confirmation of findings. This goal, however, does not diminish the value of singular, well-designed studies. The NEDU study is certainly one of these, most valuable in reminding divers that factors beyond the pressure-time profile will affect decompression risk. Divers must have adequate thermal protection to function effectively (physically and cognitively) throughout a dive. However, excessive warming during the descent/bottom phase increases inert gas uptake and can compromise decompression safety. Practically, while it may be optimal for divers to be cool or cold during the descent/bottom phase, it is prudent to recommend a thermoneutral range and avoidance of any excessive warming. Being cool during the ascent/stop phase inhibits inert gas elimination and can compromise safety but sudden warming must be constrained to avoid reducing the gas solubility of superficial tissues that could promote localized bubble formation and symptoms of skin bends. Active heating systems are attractive, but they have the potential to create the worst decompression stress condition; excessive heating during the descent/bottom phase and cooling during the ascent/stop phase if they fail part way through a dive. The risk is still elevated, though, if the systems work throughout a dive. Gerth et al were able to increase the bottom time to 70 minutes for both the 'coldwarm' and 'warm-warm' conditions, but the rate of DCS was significantly lower for the 'cold-warm' condition (see above). This lesson is relevant to any diving exposure. Ultimately, divers need to be aware of the potential impact of thermal status. Thermal protection should preserve clear thinking and physical performance, but excessive manipulation should be avoided. For many, passive systems will provide adequate and appropriate protection. For those who need or choose active warming systems, thoughtful use is vital. Further research is required to quantify the hazards and be able to incorporate thermal status into decompression algorithms in a meaningful way.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26415074/,2022-11-27 11:21:05 PM
Thermal shock fracture behavior of wave-transparent brittle materials in hypersonic vehicles under high thermal flux by digital image correlation,"Lujin Lin, Dafang Wu, Haoyuan Ren, Fanghui Zhu, Lujin Lin, Dafang Wu, Haoyuan Ren, Fanghui Zhu",2019 Apr 1,"During diving, high orbit maneuver, or target detection and positioning, a hypersonic vehicle will experience high thermal flux. Aerodynamic heating will cause intense thermal shock to the antenna window and radar dome, which are usually made of brittle materials that are transparent to electromagnetic waves and are critical to the mission of target positioning and hitting. Therefore, determination of the time to fracture of the brittle materials under high thermal flux is of great significance. In this study, thermal shock tests were performed on two brittle materials, i.e., SiO2 and Al2O3, using a quartz lamp radiator test system with a maximum thermal flux of 1.5MW/m2. The difference between the pre-set and actual thermal fluxes for the tests was smaller than 1.0%. The time to fracture was determined for the two brittle materials by employing the digital image correlation method to capture and analyze changes in speckle images of the specimen's surface. The speckle image analysis also revealed variations in the surface strain values (εx and εy) prior to fracture. The test results provide important input for the safety and reliability design of radar domes and other electromagnetic wave-transparent signal detection and positioning components of hypersonic vehicles when subjected to high thermal fluxes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31045170/,2022-11-27 11:21:05 PM
A Software Tool for the Annotation of Embolic Events in Echo Doppler Audio Signals,"Paola Pierleoni, Lorenzo Maurizi, Lorenzo Palma, Alberto Belli, Simone Valenti, Alessandro Marroni, Paola Pierleoni, Lorenzo Maurizi, Lorenzo Palma, Alberto Belli, Simone Valenti, Alessandro Marroni",2017 Dec 7,"The use of precordial Doppler monitoring to prevent decompression sickness (DS) is well known by the scientific community as an important instrument for early diagnosis of DS. However, the timely and correct diagnosis of DS without assistance from diving medical specialists is unreliable. Thus, a common protocol for the manual annotation of echo Doppler signals and a tool for their automated recording and annotation are necessary. We have implemented original software for efficient bubble appearance annotation and proposed a unified annotation protocol. The tool auto-sets the response time of human ""bubble examiners,"" performs playback of the Doppler file by rendering it independent of the specific audio player, and enables the annotation of individual bubbles or multiple bubbles known as ""showers."" The tool provides a report with an optimized data structure and estimates the embolic risk level according to the Extended Spencer Scale.

Potential nitrous oxide production by marine shellfish in response to warming and nutrient enrichment,"M Gárate, S Moseman-Valtierra, A Moen, M Gárate, S Moseman-Valtierra, A Moen",2019 Sep,"Bivalves facilitate microbial nitrogen cycling, which can produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Potential N2O production by three marine bivalves (Mytilus edulis, Mercenaria mercenaria and Crassostrea virginica) was measured in the laboratory including responses to nitrogen (N) loading and/or warming over short-terms (up to 14 or 28 days). N additions (targeting 100 μM-N ammonium nitrate) or warming (22 °C) individually and in combination were applied with experimental controls (20 μM-N, 19 °C). N2O production rates were higher with N additions for all species, but warming lacked significant direct effects. Ammonium and nitrate concentrations varied but were consistent with nitrification as a potential N2O source for all bivalves. Highest N2O emissions (7.5 nmol N2O g-1 h-1) were from M. edulis under hypoxic conditions coincident with a drop in pH. Macro-epifauna on M. edulis did not significantly alter N2O production.

A novel hazard avoidance model based on young drivers' characteristics: A driving simulator study,"Morteza Asadamraji, Veerle Ross, Ali Yarahmadi, Morteza Asadamraji, Veerle Ross, Ali Yarahmadi",2022 Aug 19,"This paper aims to examine the key factors influencing young drivers' hazard avoidance in Iran. In this study, a hazard avoidance index is defined and calculated for investigating the effect of impulsiveness, behavioral, and psychological characteristics on driving hazard avoidance. A questionnaire and go-no-go and flanker computer tests as well as a driving simulator are used for collecting data from 173 Iranian drivers under the age of 30. For this purpose, different scenarios were used, such as pedestrian crossing, the presence of fixed obstacles, and animals crossing the road, whose various characteristics are also changed. Structural equation modeling and the partial least squares method are applied for investigating the relationship between different variables and the hazard avoidance index. The results show that the driver hazard avoidance index is mostly affected by variables such as inhibitory control, opposite directional response, attentional impulsiveness, motion impulsiveness, non-planning impulsiveness, disregarding the law, and lapses and error. The results could help policymakers to assess diving hazard avoidance and improve training programs related to traffic safety based on the variables that are more effective on inexperienced and novice drivers' hazard avoidance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35984873/,2022-11-27 11:21:07 PM
A mini ROV-based method for recovering marine instruments at depth,"Joseph H Tarnecki, William F Patterson 3rd, Joseph H Tarnecki, William F Patterson 3rd",2020 Jul 8,"Instruments are often deployed at depth for weeks to years for a variety of marine applications. In many cases, divers can be deployed to retrieve instruments, but divers are constrained by depth limitations and safety concerns. Acoustic release technology can also be employed but can add considerable expense and acoustic releases will at times fail. Here, we report a simple method that utilizes a commercially available mooring hook integrated with a mini remotely operated vehicle to attach lines to instruments deployed on the sea floor, which can then be winched to the surface. The mooring hook apparatus was tested in a pool setting and then used to retrieve acoustic telemetry receiver bases (50 kg) or fish traps (30-50 kg) from the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf at depths between 28 and 80 m.

[The influence of barometric pressure changes in the oral cavity: dental barotrauma and barodontalgia],"I Nakdimon, E Zehavi, L Chapnik, Y Zadik, I Nakdimon, E Zehavi, L Chapnik, Y Zadik",2014 Jul,"Several oro-facial physiologic and pathologic phenomena affect individuals during flight or self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving. Physicians and dentists who treat aircrews and divers are occasionally challenged by those manifestations, though their uncommon appearance. This article reviews the two main barometric-related phenomena in the oral cavity: dental barotrauma and barodontalgia. Dental barotrauma includes all barometric-related dental mechanical phenomena. Tooth fracture or failure of dental restoration usually appears in a tooth with a leaking restoration or secondary caries lesion. In addition, changes in barometric pressure can cause a reduction in the retention of dental restoration and appliance. Barodontalgia is the oral pain which evoked during changes of the atmospheric pressure. This manifestation can be classified as a direct or non-direct pain. In most cases, the direct pain is caused by deterioration of pre-existed oral disease, whereas the source of the nondirect pain is an extra-oral facial barotrauma.

Indeed, as reported by others, ingestion of even a small amount of concentrated H₂O₂ can result in CAGE. Hence, whether aero-medical transfer proceeds or not, severe, life-threatening embolism can occur.

      We designed a patella cryo-free method to protect patella from cryoinjury during recycled frozen bone-prosthesis-composite reconstruction for proximal tibial malignancy. This study aimed to use animal model to ensure safety and efficacy of this method and reported our clinical outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Six swine proximal tibias along with patella and patellar tendon were harvested and dived into group A (n = 3, traditional patella freezing) and group B (n = 3, patella cryo-free). Temperature curve measurement, histological analysis, and TUNEL assay were performed in both groups. Clinically, we retrospectively reviewed 23 patients with proximal tibia malignant bone tumor (13: traditional patella freezing method; 10: patella cryo-free method). The clinical and functional outcomes were reported and compared in both groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Temperature curve of the group B showed that ideal therapeutic temperature (<-60°C) required to kill tumor cells can be achieved in the proximal tibia while the innocent patella can be kept in room temperature at all time. Histological analysis showed better preservation of the cartilage tissue in patella of group B. TUNEL assay showed significantly more apoptotic cells in the frozen tibia of both groups and frozen patella of group A. When reviewing our clinical results, less complication of the patella as well as better functional preservation were found in patients subjecting to patella cryo-free method. No local recurrence was observed in either group.

Hydrogen exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that may be exploited to control cancer, the occurrence and progression of which is closely related to peroxidation and inflammation. We conducted a prospective follow-up study of 82 patients with stage III and IV cancer treated with hydrogen inhalation using the ""real world evidence"" method. After 3-46 months of follow-up, 12 patients died in stage IV. After 4 weeks of hydrogen inhalation, patients reported significant improvements in fatigue, insomnia, anorexia and pain. Furthermore, 41.5% of patients had improved physical status, with the best effect achieved in lung cancer patients and the poorest in patients with pancreatic and gynecologic cancers. Of the 58 cases with one or more abnormal tumor markers elevated, the markers were decreased at 13-45 days (median 23 days) after hydrogen inhalation in 36.2%. The greatest marker decrease was in achieved lung cancer and the lowest in pancreatic and hepatic malignancies.

A pro/con review comparing the use of mono- and multiplace hyperbaric chambers for critical care,"Folke Lind, Folke Lind",2015 Mar,"Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) of critically ill patients requires special technology and appropriately trained medical team staffing for '24/7' emergency services. Regardless of the chamber system used it is essential that the attending nurse and critical care specialist understand the physics and physiology of hyperbaric oxygen for safe treatment and compression/decompression procedures. Mechanical ventilation through endotracheal tube or tracheotomy is hampered by the increased gas density and flow resistance with risks of hypoventilation, carbon dioxide retention and oxygen seizures. Ventilation should be controlled and arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels monitored. Haemodynamically unstable patients require careful risk-benefit evaluation, invasive monitoring and close supervision of inotropes, vasopressors and sedative drug infusions to avoid blood pressure swings and risk of awareness. Two distinctly different chambers are used for critical care. Small cost-efficient and easy-to-install acrylic monoplace chambers require less staffing and no inside attendant. Major disadvantages include patient isolation with difficulties to maintain standard organ support and invasive monitoring. Monoplace ventilators are less advanced and require the use of muscle relaxants and excessive sedation. Intravenous lines must be changed to specially designed IV pumps located outside the chamber with chamber pass-through and risk of inaccurate drug delivery. The multiplace chamber is better suited for HBOT of critically ill patients with failing vital functions and organ systems, primarily because it permits appropriate ICU equipment to be used inside the chamber by accompanying staff. Normal 'hands-on' intensive care continues during HBOT with close attention to all aspects of critical patient care. A regional trauma hospital-based rectangular chamber system immediately bordering critical care and emergency ward facilities is the best solution for safe HBOT in the critically ill.

Back to the future: occupational diver training in Australia,"David Smart, David Smart",2017 Dec,"The Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) had its genesis in the 1990s in response to a need to produce occupational divers who were trained to international standards with the necessary skills to safely undertake complex work in high-risk environments. Well-trained dive teams who are 'fit-for-purpose' can be regarded as the highest level of risk control in preventing accidents and workplace morbidity. Without such training, work site risks are not detected, with potentially disastrous consequences. In September 2017, the only civilian ADAS level 3 and 4 training facility in Australia, The Underwater Centre Tasmania (TUCT), closed its doors. The reasons for TUCT closure were multifactorial. However, the loss of higher level training capability in this country and its benefits to industry will have a future adverse impact.

Full-Face Mask Use during SCUBA Diving Counters Related Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Dysfunction,"Morgan Levenez, Kate Lambrechts, Simona Mrakic-Sposta, Alessandra Vezzoli, Peter Germonpré, Hadrien Pique, Fabio Virgili, Gerardo Bosco, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra, Morgan Levenez, Kate Lambrechts, Simona Mrakic-Sposta, Alessandra Vezzoli, Peter Germonpré, Hadrien Pique, Fabio Virgili, Gerardo Bosco, Pierre Lafère, Costantino Balestra",2022 Jan 15,"Impaired flow mediated dilation (FMD), an index of vascular stress, is known after SCUBA diving. This is related to a dysfunction of nitric oxide (NO) availability and a disturbance of the redox status, possibly induced by hyperoxic/hyperbaric gas breathing. SCUBA diving is usually performed with a mask only covering ""half face"" (HF) and therefore forcing oral breathing. Nasal NO production is involved in vascular homeostasis and, as consequence, can significantly reduce NO possibly promoting vascular dysfunction. More recently, the utilization of ""full-face"" (FF) mask, allowing nasal breathing, became more frequent, but no reports are available describing their effects on vascular functions in comparison with HF masks. In this study we assessed and compared the effects of a standard shallow dive (20 min at 10 m) wearing either FF or a HF mask on different markers of vascular function (FMD), oxidative stress (ROS, 8-iso-PGF2α) and NO availability and metabolism (NO2, NOx and 3-NT and iNOS expression). Data from a dive breathing a hypoxic (16% O2 at depth) gas mixture with HF mask are shown allowing hyperoxic/hypoxic exposure. Our data suggest that nasal breathing might significantly reduce the occurrence of vascular dysfunction possibly due to better maintenance of NO production and bioavailability, resulting in a better ability to counter reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Besides the obvious outcomes in terms of SCUBA diving safety, our data permit a better understanding of the effects of oxygen concentrations, either in normal conditions or as a strategy to induce selected responses in health and disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35055791/,2022-11-27 11:21:14 PM

A High-Dimensional and Small-Sample Submersible Fault Detection Method Based on Feature Selection and Data Augmentation,"Penghui Zhao, Qinghe Zheng, Zhongjun Ding, Yi Zhang, Hongjun Wang, Yang Yang, Penghui Zhao, Qinghe Zheng, Zhongjun Ding, Yi Zhang, Hongjun Wang, Yang Yang",2021 Dec 29,"The fault detection of manned submersibles plays a very important role in protecting the safety of submersible equipment and personnel. However, the diving sensor data is scarce and high-dimensional, so this paper proposes a submersible fault detection method, which is made up of feature selection module based on hierarchical clustering and Autoencoder (AE), the improved Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)-based data augmentation module and fault detection module using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with LeNet-5 structure. First, feature selection is developed to select the features that have a strong correlation with failure event. Second, data augmentation model is conducted to generate sufficient data for training the CNN model, including rough data generation and data refiners. Finally, a fault detection framework with LeNet-5 is trained and fine-tuned by synthetic data, and tested using real data. Experiment results based on sensor data from submersible hydraulic system demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully detect the fault samples. The detection accuracy of proposed method can reach 97% and our method significantly outperforms other classic detection algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35009748/,2022-11-27 11:21:16 PM

The cargoes delivered by SWNTs include peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, as well as drug molecules for therapeutic purpose. The drug delivery functions of SWNTs have been explored over the past decade. Many breakthrough studies have shown the high specificity and potency of functionalized SWNT-based drug delivery systems for the treatment of cancers and other diseases.

A survey of caustic cocktail events in rebreather divers,"Peter Buzzacott, Grant Z Dong, Rhiannon J Brenner, Frauke Tillmans, Peter Buzzacott, Grant Z Dong, Rhiannon J Brenner, Frauke Tillmans",2022 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      Closed-circuit rebreathers (CCRs) are designed to be watertight. Ingressing water may react with carbon dioxide absorbent in the CCR, which may produce alkaline soda with a pH of 12-14, popularly referred to by CCR divers as a 'caustic cocktail'. This study aimed to explore divers' responses to caustic cocktail events and to investigate if CCR diving experience is associated with experiencing a caustic cocktail.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An online survey instrument was developed and an invitation to participate was extended to certified CCR divers aged ≥ 18 years. Relationships between number of caustic cocktail events and potential risk factors: age; hours of rebreather diving experience; and number of rebreather dives were explored.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 413 respondents, 394 (95%) identified as male, mean age was 46 years and median length of CCR certification was six years. Fifty-seven percent (n = 237) of respondents reported having experienced a caustic cocktail. The probability of self-reporting none, one, or more caustic cocktail events increased with experience. Divers reported a variety of first aid treatments for caustic cocktails, with ∼80% citing their CCR instructor as a source of information.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The more hours or dives a CCR diver accrues, the more likely they will self-report having experienced one or more caustic cocktail events. The majority of CCR divers responded to a caustic cocktail by rinsing the oral cavity with water. A proportion of divers, however, responded by ingesting soda, dairy, juice, or a mildly acidic solution such as a mixture of vinegar and water. The recommendation to immediately flush with water needs reinforcing among rebreather divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35732280/,2022-11-27 11:21:18 PM

However, the forms of Tau released into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) in vivo during the development of Tauopathy and their pathological relevance remain unclear. Combining in vivo microdialysis and biochemical analysis, we find that in Tau transgenic mice, human Tau (hTau) present in brain ISF is truncated and comprises at least 10 distinct fragments spanning the entire Tau protein. The fragmentation pattern is similar across different Tau transgenic models, pathological stages and brain areas. ISF hTau concentration decreases during Tauopathy progression, while its phosphorylation increases. ISF from mice with established Tauopathy induces Tau aggregation in HEK293-Tau biosensor cells. Notably, immunodepletion of ISF phosphorylated Tau, but not Tau fragments, significantly reduces its ability to seed Tau aggregation and only a fraction of Tau, separated by ultracentrifugation, is seeding-competent. These results indicate that ISF seeding competence is driven by a small subset of Tau, which potentially contribute to the propagation of Tau pathology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34655982/,2022-11-27 11:21:18 PM
Jumping to (fatal) conclusions? An analysis of video film on a social networking web site of recreational jumping from height into water,"Kevin Moran, Kevin Moran",2014,"In high-income countries, death as a consequence of recreational jumping into water from height has not been well investigated partly because it traditionally has been a covert activity within youth culture. An observational study of video recordings posted on the YouTube web site was used to gather data on the nature of jumping activity in New Zealand and Australia. An analytical framework was developed to identify site- participant- social characteristics (10 variables) and online feedback (4 variables). Of the 389 videos recorded in New Zealand (n = 210) and Australia (n = 179), 929 jumpers were observed, and rivers were the most frequently reported site of jumping activity (New Zealand 47%; Australia 35%). One fifth (20%) of the jumps in New Zealand and one third (33%) in Australia were from heights estimated to be more than 12 m. The YouTube website portraying jumps from height were visited almost half a million times (495,686 hits). Ways of reducing recreational jumping risk via targeted education interventions may be best directed at young male adults.

Breathalysing and surveying river users in Australia to understand alcohol consumption and attitudes toward drowning risk,"Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat, Amy E Peden, Richard C Franklin, Peter A Leggat",2018 Dec 19,"Background:
        
      
      Little is known about people's river usage, a leading drowning location. This study examines alcohol consumption patterns of river users and their attitudes to drowning risk.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A convenience sample of adult (18+ years) river users were surveyed at four river locations. The survey covered eight domains: demographics; river attendance frequency; frequency of engaging in water activities; drinking patterns; alcohol and water safety knowledge; alcohol and water safety attitudes; alcohol consumption; and Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). For BAC, participants were asked to record time since their last alcoholic drink and were then breathalysed to record an estimate of their BAC. BAC was examined by BAC reading (negative, positive, ≥0.050%). Hazardous lifetime drinking levels were calculated and their impact on drowning risk evaluated. Univariate and chi square analysis (95% confidence interval) was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Six hundred eighty four people participated (51.6% female; 49.0% aged 18-34 years). Sixteen percent (15.9%) had a positive BAC (Mean + BAC = 0.068%; SD ± 0.08; Range = 0.001-0.334%), with 7.2% ≥0.050% (Mean BAC ≥0.050% =0.132%; SD ± 0.06). Those significantly more likely to record a BAC ≥0.050% at the river were: aged 18-34 years, resided in inner regional and low socio-economic areas, visited the river in the afternoon, with friends, on days with higher maximum air temperatures, frequent river users (11+ times in the last 30 days) and those who spend longer in the water (301+ minutes). River users who recorded a BAC ≥0.050% were more likely to self-report engaging in risky activities (i.e. diving into water of unknown depth and jumping into the river from height). River users on Australia day (a national public holiday) were significantly more likely to drink heavily (Mean BAC ≥0.05% = 0.175%; SD ± 0.09).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite males accounting for 85% of alcohol-related river drowning deaths, similar numbers of males and females were consuming alcohol at the river. This study has addressed a gap in knowledge by identifying river usage and alcohol consumption patterns among those at increased drowning risk. Implications for prevention include delivering alcohol-related river drowning prevention strategies to both males and females; at peak times including during hot weather, afternoons, public holidays and to river users who swim.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30567588/,2022-11-27 11:21:20 PM

An audit of persistent foramen ovale closure in 105 divers,"Alex Pearman, Luc Bugeja, Martin Nelson, Gergely V Szantho, Mark Turner, Alex Pearman, Luc Bugeja, Martin Nelson, Gergely V Szantho, Mark Turner",2015 Jun,"Introduction:
        
      
      Right-to-left shunt across a persistent foramen ovale (PFO) has been associated with cutaneous, neurological and vestibular decompression illness (DCI). Percutaneous closure of a PFO has been used to reduce the risk of DCI. There are no randomised controlled trial data to support PFO closure for the prevention of decompression illness (DCI), so the need for audit data on the safety and efﬁcacy of this technique has been recognised by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Retrospective audit of all transcatheter PFO closures to reduce the risk of DCI performed by a single cardiologist with an interest in diving medicine.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 105 eligible divers undergoing 107 procedures was identiﬁed. There was a low rate of procedural complications; a rate lower than a recent randomised trial of PFO closure for stroke. Atrial ﬁbrillation required treatment in two patients. One patient with a previously repaired mitral valve had a stroke that was thought to be unrelated to the PFO closure. Sixteen divers had minor post-procedure symptoms not requiring any treatment. Two divers required a second procedure because of residual shunt; both subsequently returned to unrestricted diving. Eighty-one of 95 divers in whom follow-up bubble contrast echocardiography was available returned to unrestricted diving.

Compressed Air Working in Chennai During Metro Tunnel Construction: Occupational Health Problems,"Ajit C Kulkarni, Ajit C Kulkarni",2017 Sep-Dec,"Chennai metropolis has been growing rapidly. Need was felt of a metro rail system. Two corridors were planned. Corridor 1, of 23 km starting from Washermanpet to Airport. 14.3 km of this would be underground. Corridor 2, of 22 km starting from Chennai Central Railway station to St. Thomas Mount. 9.7 km of this would be underground.

Are safe guards at trampoline parks safe enough?: A case report on a complete spinal cord injury after diving into a trampoline park foam pit,"Jae Eun Lee, Ju Hyun Kim, Chan Hee Park, Dae Won Gwak, Chul-Hyun Kim, Donghwi Park, Jong-Moon Hwang, Jae Eun Lee, Ju Hyun Kim, Chan Hee Park, Dae Won Gwak, Chul-Hyun Kim, Donghwi Park, Jong-Moon Hwang",2019 Nov,"Rationale:
        
      
      Recently, commercial indoor trampoline parks have been opened around the globe, and both the number of venues and the park users are increasing. Academic literatures have largely focused on home trampoline related injuries, and less is known about the injuries associated with trampoline parks due to the limited number of studies or cases reported. In this report, we present a complete spinal cord injury sustained at a commercial indoor trampoline park.
    


          Patient concerns:
        
      
      A 26-year old male developed tetraplegia after plainly jumping on the trampolines and diving into one of the foam pits head first.
    


          Diagnosis:
        
      
      C-spine CT revealed bilateral interfacetal dislocation on C6-7, and his C-spine MRI showed anterior translational injury at C6-7 with severe cord encroachment and complete discoligamentous complex disruption. He was diagnosed with complete spinal cord injury.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      The patient underwent 30 minutes each of physical therapy and occupational therapy twice a day for a total of 25 days of in-patient rehabilitation. Interventions included tilt table, passive range of motion exercises, functional electrical stimulation, sitting balance training, upper extremity strengthening exercise, and hand manipulation exercises.
    


          Outcome:
        
      
      Despite intensive rehabilitation and the patient's good spirit, there was no functional change in all physical examinations between evaluations at initial and at discharge.
    


          Lessons:
        
      
      In conclusion, we aim to alert the risks associated with improper use of trampolines, promote safer entertainment environment, and aid in developing mandatory safety measures.

Testing of full face snorkel masks to examine recreational snorkeler deaths,"Jane Farrell, Michael J Natoli, Gregory J Brown, Adam Yook, Rachel M Lance, Jane Farrell, Michael J Natoli, Gregory J Brown, Adam Yook, Rachel M Lance",2022 First Quarter,"A recent rise in snorkeling-related deaths in Hawaii has inspired several bans on full face snorkel masks (FFSMs). However, while there are theories to explain the deaths, little physiological data exists about the way the FFSMs provide gas to an exercising subject. To evaluate the safety of the FFSM concept, this study was designed to test how use of a full face snorkel mask (FFSM) may be physiologically different than use of a conventional snorkel, and to assess if any of those differences could lead to increased risk for the snorkeler. Ten (10) volunteer human subjects were tested using a variety of commercially available FFSMs, with real-time monitoring of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), inspired airway pressure, and inspired and expired levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Two of the three FFSM design types were shown not to function as advertised, but none of the masks provided physiologically problematic gas supplies to the snorkelers. While this testing yielded no conclusive ""smoking gun"" to explain the snorkeler deaths, some of the mask models showed patterns of increasing breathing resistance with water intrusion because of a shared design characteristic, and this increased resistance could potentially create elevated levels of respiratory distress to snorkelers during real-world use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35226974/,2022-11-27 11:21:24 PM
Electrodermal Activity Is Sensitive to Cognitive Stress under Water,"Hugo F Posada-Quintero, John P Florian, Alvaro D Orjuela-Cañón, Ki H Chon, Hugo F Posada-Quintero, John P Florian, Alvaro D Orjuela-Cañón, Ki H Chon",2018 Jan 17,"When divers are at depth in water, the high pressure and low temperature alone can cause severe stress, challenging the human physiological control systems. The addition of cognitive stress, for example during a military mission, exacerbates the challenge. In these conditions, humans are more susceptible to autonomic imbalance. Reliable tools for the assessment of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) could be used as indicators of the relative degree of stress a diver is experiencing, which could reveal heightened risk during a mission. Electrodermal activity (EDA), a measure of the changes in conductance at the skin surface due to sweat production, is considered a promising alternative for the non-invasive assessment of sympathetic control of the ANS. EDA is sensitive to stress of many kinds. Therefore, as a first step, we tested the sensitivity of EDA, in the time and frequency domains, specifically to cognitive stress during water immersion of the subject (albeit with their measurement finger dry for safety). The data from 14 volunteer subjects were used from the experiment. After a 4-min adjustment and baseline period after being immersed in water, subjects underwent the Stroop task, which is known to induce cognitive stress. The time-domain indices of EDA, skin conductance level (SCL) and non-specific skin conductance responses (NS.SCRs), did not change during cognitive stress, compared to baseline measurements. Frequency-domain indices of EDA, EDASymp (based on power spectral analysis) and TVSymp (based on time-frequency analysis), did significantly change during cognitive stress. This leads to the conclusion that EDA, assessed by spectral analysis, is sensitive to cognitive stress in water-immersed subjects, and can potentially be used to detect cognitive stress in divers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29387015/,2022-11-27 11:21:25 PM

After conducting a frequency analysis on the collected questionnaires, the conclusions are made as follows. First, in terms of diving depth, the most frequent diving depth was 15-20 m among ocean divers, 20-25 m among sports divers, and 15-20 m in case of dive leaders. Second, with regard to the causes of injuries, the most frequently answered causes are 'overtension' and 'low skill' among ocean divers; 'low skill' among sports divers; 'overaction' among dive leaders. Third, in terms of injury patterns, the most frequently answered injury patterns are 'ear' injuries among ocean divers; 'ankle' injuries among sports divers; 'ankle' and 'calf' injuries among dive leaders. Fourth, with regard to who performed first-aid when an injury accident happened, the most frequent answers are 'instructor' among ocean divers; 'instructor' and 'self' among sports divers; 'self' among dive leaders. We might suggest that more efforts need to be made to improve divers' low dependence on specialists for treatment and consultation so that we can prevent an injury from leading to the second injury accident.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26730384/,2022-11-27 11:21:26 PM

Safety behaviour and healthy diving: a qualitative study in the traditional diverse fishermen,"Kusnanto Kusnanto, La Rakhmat Wabula, Bambang Purwanto, Hidayat Arifin, Yulia Kurniawati, Kusnanto Kusnanto, La Rakhmat Wabula, Bambang Purwanto, Hidayat Arifin, Yulia Kurniawati",2020,"Background:
        
      
      Traditional divers from the Maluku Province of Indonesia have not received formal education and training related to standard diving tools. They only become accomplished at diving generation by generation. The use of non-standard diving tools increases the risk of injury and illness. This study aimed to get an overview of the health and safety behaviours of traditional divers.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The study was qualitative, involving 15 traditional divers who used compressors for at least 1 year and who'd had decompression sickness and barotrauma as a result of diving. The data was obtained through in-depth interviews, analysed through the Colaizzi method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The participants' diving health and safety behaviour is triggered by the perception of the risk of diving. This is supported by the reinforcing social and environmental factors leading to the form of health and safety behaviour when diving. These behaviours include diving without planning, using a compressor, and making ""sesajen"" (kind of food, leaves, and water that are believed to be a form of surrender to the creator) which is an offering or present to the gods or ancestors. This behaviour causes complaints such as trauma and an increased economic burden. Some participants consider complaints as a threat and plan to stop diving. The participants made a plan before dive and declared that they would change their behaviour to ensure safety.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Health and safety behaviour related to diving must be socialised and facilitated.

Mapping reef fish and the seascape: using acoustics and spatial modeling to guide coastal management,"Bryan Costa, J Christopher Taylor, Laura Kracker, Tim Battista, Simon Pittman, Bryan Costa, J Christopher Taylor, Laura Kracker, Tim Battista, Simon Pittman",2014 Jan 15,"Reef fish distributions are patchy in time and space with some coral reef habitats supporting higher densities (i.e., aggregations) of fish than others. Identifying and quantifying fish aggregations (particularly during spawning events) are often top priorities for coastal managers. However, the rapid mapping of these aggregations using conventional survey methods (e.g., non-technical SCUBA diving and remotely operated cameras) are limited by depth, visibility and time. Acoustic sensors (i.e., splitbeam and multibeam echosounders) are not constrained by these same limitations, and were used to concurrently map and quantify the location, density and size of reef fish along with seafloor structure in two, separate locations in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Reef fish aggregations were documented along the shelf edge, an ecologically important ecotone in the region. Fish were grouped into three classes according to body size, and relationships with the benthic seascape were modeled in one area using Boosted Regression Trees. These models were validated in a second area to test their predictive performance in locations where fish have not been mapped. Models predicting the density of large fish (≥ 29 cm) performed well (i.e., AUC = 0.77). Water depth and standard deviation of depth were the most influential predictors at two spatial scales (100 and 300 m). Models of small (≤ 11 cm) and medium (12-28 cm) fish performed poorly (i.e., AUC = 0.49 to 0.68) due to the high prevalence (45-79%) of smaller fish in both locations, and the unequal prevalence of smaller fish in the training and validation areas.

Beaked whales and state-dependent decision-making: how does body condition affect the trade-off between foraging and predator avoidance?,"Eilidh Siegal, Sascha K Hooker, Saana Isojunno, Patrick J O Miller, Eilidh Siegal, Sascha K Hooker, Saana Isojunno, Patrick J O Miller",2022 Jan 26,"Body condition is central to how animals balance foraging with predator avoidance-a trade-off that fundamentally affects animal fitness. Animals in poor condition may accept greater predation risk to satisfy current foraging 'needs', while those in good condition may be more risk averse to protect future 'assets'. These state-dependent behavioural predictions can help interpret responses to human activities, but are little explored in marine animals. This study investigates the influence of body condition on how beaked whales trade-off foraging and predator avoidance. Body density (indicating lipid-energy stores) was estimated for 15 foraging northern bottlenose whales tagged near Jan Mayen, Norway. Composite indices of foraging (diving and echolocation clicks) and anti-predation (long ascents, non-foraging dives and silent periods reducing predator eavesdropping) were negatively related. Experimental sonar exposures led to decreased foraging and increased risk aversion, confirming a foraging/perceived safety trade-off. However, lower lipid stores were not related to a decrease in predator avoidance versus foraging, i.e. worse condition animals did not prioritize foraging. Individual differences (personalities) or reproductive context could offer alternative explanations for the observed state-behaviour relationships. This study provides evidence of foraging/predator-avoidance trade-offs in a marine top predator and demonstrates that animals in worse condition might not always take more risks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35078370/,2022-11-27 11:21:29 PM

Lycopene is one of the most commonly ingested members of fat-soluble carotenoid family that gives vegetables and fruits their red, yellow, or orange color. Lycopene has established itself as a promising therapy for AD owing to its neuroprotective activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiamyloidogenic properties. In this review, we highlight the various in vitro and preclinical studies demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of lycopene. Also, some epidemiological and interventional studies investigating the protective effect of lycopene in AD have been discussed.

"Environmental influences on the abundance and sexual composition of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias in Gansbaai, South Africa","Alison V Towner, Les G Underhill, Oliver J D Jewell, Malcolm J Smale, Alison V Towner, Les G Underhill, Oliver J D Jewell, Malcolm J Smale",2013 Aug 12,"The seasonal occurrence of white sharks visiting Gansbaai, South Africa was investigated from 2007 to 2011 using sightings from white shark cage diving boats. Generalized linear models were used to investigate the number of great white sharks sighted per trip in relation to sex, month, sea surface temperature and Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Indices (MEI). Water conditions are more variable in summer than winter due to wind-driven cold water upwelling and thermocline displacement, culminating in colder water temperatures, and shark sightings of both sexes were higher during the autumn and winter months (March-August). MEI, an index to quantify the strength of Southern Oscillation, differed in its effect on the recorded numbers of male and female white sharks, with highly significant interannual trends. This data suggests that water temperature and climatic phenomena influence the abundance of white sharks at this coastal site. In this study, more females were seen in Gansbaai overall in warmer water/positive MEI years. Conversely, the opposite trend was observed for males. In cool water years (2010 to 2011) sightings of male sharks were significantly higher than in previous years. The influence of environmental factors on the physiology of sharks in terms of their size and sex is discussed. The findings of this study could contribute to bather safety programmes because the incorporation of environmental parameters into predictive models may help identify times and localities of higher risk to bathers and help mitigate human-white shark interactions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23951111/,2022-11-27 11:21:30 PM

Although tourism is an important economic vehicle for the host country, its continued growth has led to on-going concerns about its environmental sustainability. Coastal and marine tourism can directly affect the environment through direct and indirect tourist activities. For these reasons tourism sector needs practical actions of sustainability. Several studies have shown how education minimizes the impact on and is proactive for, preserving the natural resources. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a citizen science program to improve the environmental education of the volunteers, by means of questionnaires provided to participants to a volunteer-based Red Sea coral reef monitoring program (STEproject). Fifteen multiple-choice questions evaluated the level of knowledge on the basic coral reef biology and ecology and the awareness on the impact of human behaviour on the environment. Volunteers filled in questionnaires twice, once at the beginning, before being involved in the project and again at the end of their stay, after several days participation in the program. We found that the participation in STEproject significantly increased both the knowledge of coral reef biology and ecology and the awareness of human behavioural impacts on the environment, but was more effective on the former. We also detected that tourists with a higher education level have a higher initial level of environmental education than less educated people and that the project was more effective on divers than snorkelers. This study has emphasized that citizen science projects have an important and effective educational value and has suggested that tourism and diving stakeholders should increase their commitment and efforts to these programs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26200660/,2022-11-27 11:21:31 PM

Bycatch and chronic entanglements are responsible for thousands of cetacean deaths per year globally. This study represents the first systematic approach to the postmortem investigation of fishery interactions in stranded cetaceans in the Canary Islands. We retrospectively studied 586 cases necropsied between January 2000 and December 2018. Of the cases with a known cause of death, 7.4% (32/453) were due to fishery interactions, and the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) was the most affected species [46.9% (15/32)]. Three types of fishery interactions were recognized by gross findings: bycatch [65.6% (21/32)], chronic entanglements [18.8% (6/32)], and fishermen aggression [15.6% (5/32)]. Among the bycaught cases, we differentiated the dolphins that died because of ingestion of longline hooks [23.8% (5/21)] from those that died because of fishing net entrapments [76.2% (16/21)], including dolphins that presumably died at depth due to peracute underwater entrapment (PUE) [37.5% (6/16)], dolphins that were hauled out alive and suffered additional trauma during handling [43.8% (7/16)], and those that were released alive but became stranded and died because of fishery interactions [18.7% (3/16)]. Gross and histologic findings of animals in each group were presented and compared. The histological approach confirmed gross lesions and excluded other possible causes of death. Cetaceans in good-fair body condition and shallow diving species were significantly more affected by fishery interactions, in agreement with the literature. Low rates of fishery interactions have been described, compared with other regions. However, within the last few years, sightings of entangled live whales, especially the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Bryde's whale (B. edeni), have increased. This study contributes to further improvement of the evaluation of different types of fishery interactions and may facilitate the enforcement of future conservation policies to preserve cetacean populations in the Canary Islands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33195545/,2022-11-27 11:21:32 PM
Performance of the Oxylog® 1000 portable ventilator in a hyperbaric environment,"Lie Sui An, Loy Shun Ting, Lee Cheng Chuan, Kim Soo Joang, Soh Chai Rick, Lie Sui An, Loy Shun Ting, Lee Cheng Chuan, Kim Soo Joang, Soh Chai Rick",2018 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The management of mechanically ventilated patients in the hyperbaric environment requires knowledge of how the physical properties of gases change under pressure and how this affects the operation of the ventilator. The primary objective of this study was to test the performance of the Dräger Oxylog 1000® ventilator in a hyperbaric environment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Each of two ventilators was connected to a mechanical test lung system with an in-built pressure gauge. We used a Wright's respirometer to measure the tidal volumes. The same ventilator settings were tested under varying environmental pressures from ambient (101.3 kPa) to 18 meters' sea water (284 kPa) in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A decrease was found in tidal volume, decrease in airway pressure and increase in respiratory rate delivered by the Dräger Oxylog 1000 portable ventilator with increasing pressures to 284 kPa.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      These findings can be explained by the operating principles of the Oxylog 1000, which is a time-controlled, constant-volume ventilator that functions as a flow chopper. Even between the two Oxylog 1000 ventilators tested there were different absolute changes in tidal volume, airway pressures and respiratory rates at various depths. Hence, the trend of changes in these variables is probably more important than absolute values.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In summary, understanding the trend of changes in ventilator variables will allow clinicians to make appropriate corrections in ventilator settings and carefully monitor adequacy of ventilation to prevent adverse ventilator-associated events. The Dräger Oxylog 1000 portable ventilator is an adequate back-up ventilator for use with straight-forward, ventilator-dependent patients undergoing hyperbaric treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888382/,2022-11-27 11:21:32 PM

Forty-six volunteers (25M/21F; 20 ± 8 years) participated and performed 10 easy-to-administer and practical aquatic tasks. Group A was formed by 36 elite athletes (M/F 20/16, 24.7 ± 10yrs) from two sports categories depending on their affinity to the water environment: terrestrial (wrestling, cycling, dancing) and aquatic (swimming, synchronized swimming, free diving) sports. Group B was formed by 10 non-athlete participants (5M/5F, 14.4 ± 1.4yrs) and was assessed by two independent evaluators. Participants in Group A performed the aquatic tasks once to develop the final AAT items and cutoffs. Participants in Group B performed the aquatic tasks twice on different days to assess repeatability. Factor analysis recommended all 10 aquatic tasks to be included in the final AAT, resulting in scores ranging from 9.5 to 49.5. The AAT scores were statistically different between the terrestrial and the aquatic sports' participants (p < 0.001). The duration of the test was 25 min from the time of water entry. Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses demonstrated that the cutoffs for low and high aquaticity levels in this sample were ≤23.7 and ≥43.3, respectively. Reliability analyses demonstrated that the aquaticity scores obtained on different days and by different examiners highly correlated (p < 0.001) and were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The AAT appears to be a valid and reliable tool for the evaluation of human physical adequacy in the water. It is an easy and user-friendly test which can be performed in any swimming pool without a need for highly trained staff and specialized equipment, however more research needs to be done in order to be applied in other population group.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27634070/,2022-11-27 11:21:33 PM

This work aimed to test and validate the usefulness of studying humeral bone radiodensity by CT of two cetacean species (the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the pygmy sperm whale) with different swimming and diving habits. The radiodensity was analysed at certain levels following a new protocol based on a review of previous studies. Humeral radiodensity values were related to four aspects: species, diving behaviour, swimming activity level, and age. We observed that the consistent differences in the radiodensity of the cortical bone of the distal epiphysis between animals of different life-history categories suggest that this bone portion could be particularly useful for future ontogenetic studies.

The use of Spielberger's State-Trait Personality Inventory (trait anxiety subscale) with naval subaquatic specialists,"Charles H Van Wijk, Charles H Van Wijk",2014 Dec,"Objectives:
        
      
      Panic behavior poses a particular threat to the health and safety of subaquatic occupational specialists. Trait anxiety has previously been identified as a marker of panic behavior under water, and Spielberger's State-Trait Personality Inventory (trait anxiety subscale) has been previously used to measure trait anxiety among subaquatic specialists. Using archived data, the trait anxiety scores of subaquatic specialists were analyzed to meet 3 objectives: 1stly - to develop a trait anxiety profile of subaquatic specialists; 2ndly - to investigate the predictive value of trait anxiety measures upon entering an occupational field; and 3rdly - to establish the reliability of these scores over time.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Archival trait-anxiety data from 322 subjects were analyzed statistically.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Analysis of the available scores revealed a highly homogenous as well as a very low trait anxiety profile for the investigated occupational group. Additionally, low trait anxiety was somewhat associated with success during specialist training: fewer candidates with high trait anxiety scores completed their qualification. Moreover, measurement of trait anxiety was stable over time, which suggests that when scores for this occupational group are screened, deviations from previous scores could signify a potential need for referral to an intervention from health professionals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using the trait anxiety subscale as part of occupational health surveillance of subaquatic specialists could support prevention of accidents by identifying high-risk candidates during their annual health assessments, and referral for timeous intervention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25503890/,2022-11-27 11:21:35 PM

Blood glucose levels tend to decline during diving, probably because of changes in insulin requirements and resistance, due to increased physical activity and effects of hyperbaric environment on glucose tolerance. Strict adherence to safety protocols, in conjunction with optimal physical status, lack of diabetic complications (especially impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia) and satisfactory baseline glycaemic control, seem to minimise the risk of complications during diving. The integration of modern technology into diabetes management, providing potential for underwater continuous glucose monitoring, can be useful in optimising metabolic control before, during and after diving. Despite the significant progress been made on safety issues, there is still a need to implement the relevant recommendations into divers' everyday practice. Existing evidence is mainly derived from small studies and there is a wide heterogeneity in terms of study designs and explored outcomes, rendering the extraction of definitive conclusions challenging.

      We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using Nitrox 50 as breathing gas during attendance in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Paper logs between Jan.-Dec. 2011 were reviewed to analyze nitrogen gas-loading, actual bottom time, total bottom time and surface interval time. With the use of the Norwegian Diving Tables nitrogen gas-loading was converted to Repetitive Group Letters. Symptoms of decompression sickness and health problems related to hyperbaric exposures were registered at weekly staff meetings. The chamber personnel breathed chamber air or Nitrox 50.
    


          Results:
        
      
      1,207 hyperbaric exposures were distributed to five chamber attendants and technicians, 14 doctors, and six nurses. Nitrox 50 was inhaled on 978 occasions (81.0%). Median nitrogen gas-loading after first pressurization complied with Repetitive Group Letter A (range A-E), second to C (range A-F), third to D (range A-F), fourth to E (range C-H), fifth to F (range C-H), and sixth to E (range B-G). No symptoms of decompression sickness were reported (95% CI 0.00-0.33%).

      In hyperbaric air exposures, the diver's body is subjected to an increased gas pressure, which simulates a real dive performed in water with the presence of hydrostatic pressure. The hyperbaric effect depends on pressure, its dynamics and exposure time. During compression, physical dissolution of inert gas in body fluids and tissues takes place. The decompression process should result in safe physiological disposal of excess gas from the body. However, despite the correct application of decompression tables we observe cases of decompression sickness. The study aim was to find factors affecting the safety of diving, with a particular emphasis on the diet, which thus far has not been taken into account.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study subjects were 56 divers. Before hyperbaric exposure, the following data were collected: age, height and weight; plus each divers filled out a questionnaire about their diet. The data from the questionnaires allowed us to calculate the approximate fat intake with the daily food for each diver. Moreover, blood samples were collected from each diver for analysis of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hyperbaric exposures corresponded to dives conducted to depths of 30 and 60 meters. After exposures each diver was examined via the Doppler method to determine the possible presence of microbubbles in the venous blood.
    


          Results and discussion:
        
      
      Decompression stress was observed in 29 subjects. A high-fat diet has a direct impact on increasing levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood serum. A high-fat diet significantly increases the severity of decompression stress in hyperbaric air exposures and creates a threat of pressure disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24377191/,2022-11-27 11:21:37 PM

SCUBA Diving and Asthma: Clinical Recommendations and Safety,"Christopher A Coop, Karla E Adams, Charles N Webb, Christopher A Coop, Karla E Adams, Charles N Webb",2016 Feb,"The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding asthma and SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed articles related to asthma and SCUBA diving using the following keywords: asthma, allergy, and SCUBA diving. SCUBA diving is a popular sport with more than 9 million divers in the USA. SCUBA diving can be a dangerous sport. Bronchospasm can develop in asthmatic patients and cause airway obstruction. Airway obstruction may be localized to the distal airway which prevents gas elimination. Uncontrolled expansion of the distal airway may result in pulmonary barotrauma. There is also the risk of a gas embolism. Asthmatic divers can also aspirate seawater which may induce bronchospasm. Pollen contamination of their oxygen tank may exacerbate atopic asthma in patients. Diving may be hazardous to the lung function of patients with asthma. Despite the risks of SCUBA diving, many asthmatic individuals can dive without serious diving events. Diving evaluations for asthmatic patients have focused on a thorough patient history, spirometry, allergy testing, and bronchial challenges. For patients that wish to dive, their asthma should be well controlled without current chest symptoms. Patients should have a normal spirometry. Some diving societies recommend that an asthmatic patient should successfully pass a bronchial provocation challenge. Recommendations also state that exercise-, emotion-, and cold-induced asthmatics should not dive. Asthmatic patients requiring rescue medication within 48 h should not dive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25666876/,2022-11-27 11:21:38 PM

      The relative efficacy and safety of intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab in the treatment of diabetic macular edema are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      At 89 clinical sites, we randomly assigned 660 adults (mean age, 61±10 years) with diabetic macular edema involving the macular center to receive intravitreous aflibercept at a dose of 2.0 mg (224 participants), bevacizumab at a dose of 1.25 mg (218 participants), or ranibizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg (218 participants). The study drugs were administered as often as every 4 weeks, according to a protocol-specified algorithm. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From baseline to 1 year, the mean visual-acuity letter score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better visual acuity; a score of 85 is approximately 20/20) improved by 13.3 with aflibercept, by 9.7 with bevacizumab, and by 11.2 with ranibizumab. Although the improvement was greater with aflibercept than with the other two drugs (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab and P=0.03 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab), it was not clinically meaningful, because the difference was driven by the eyes with worse visual acuity at baseline (P<0.001 for interaction). When the initial visual-acuity letter score was 78 to 69 (equivalent to approximately 20/32 to 20/40) (51% of participants), the mean improvement was 8.0 with aflibercept, 7.5 with bevacizumab, and 8.3 with ranibizumab (P>0.50 for each pairwise comparison). When the initial letter score was less than 69 (approximately 20/50 or worse), the mean improvement was 18.9 with aflibercept, 11.8 with bevacizumab, and 14.2 with ranibizumab (P<0.001 for aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P=0.003 for aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, and P=0.21 for ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab). There were no significant differences among the study groups in the rates of serious adverse events (P=0.40), hospitalization (P=0.51), death (P=0.72), or major cardiovascular events (P=0.56).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intravitreous aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab improved vision in eyes with center-involved diabetic macular edema, but the relative effect depended on baseline visual acuity. When the initial visual-acuity loss was mild, there were no apparent differences, on average, among study groups. At worse levels of initial visual acuity, aflibercept was more effective at improving vision.

The current use of wearable sensors to enhance safety and performance in breath-hold diving: A systematic review,"Giovanni Vinetti, Nicola F Lopomo, Anna Taboni, Nazzareno Fagoni, Guido Ferretti, Giovanni Vinetti, Nicola F Lopomo, Anna Taboni, Nazzareno Fagoni, Guido Ferretti",2020 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Measuring physiological parameters at depth is an emergent challenge for athletic training, diver's safety and biomedical research. Recent advances in wearable sensor technology made this challenge affordable; however, its impact on breath-hold diving has never been comprehensively discussed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to assess what types of sensors are available or suitable for human breath-hold diving, within the two-fold perspective of safety and athletic performance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the 52 studies identified, sensed physiological variables were: electrocardiogram, body temperature, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, interstitial glucose concentration, impedance cardiography, heart rate, body segment inertia and orientation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Limits and potential of each technology are separately reviewed. Inertial sensor technology and transmission pulse oximetry could produce the greatest impact on breath-hold diving performances in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32187619/,2022-11-27 11:21:55 PM

In addition to decreasing performance in-flight (chronic) fatigue has negative long-term health effects. Possible causes of fatigue include sleep loss, extended time awake, circadian phase irregularities and work load. Despite regulations limiting flight time and enabling optimal rostering, fatigue cannot be prevented completely. Especially in military operations, where limits may be extended due to operational necessities, it is impossible to rely solely on regulations to prevent fatigue. Fatigue management, consisting of preventive strategies and operational countermeasures, such as pre-flight naps and pharmaceuticals that either promote adequate sleep (hypnotics or chronobiotics) or enhance performance (stimulants), may be required to mitigate fatigue in challenging (military) aviation operations.

      Artisanal diving fishermen in Yucatán, Mexico have high rates of decompression sickness as a result of frequently unsafe diving practices with surface supplied compressed air. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON), a type of avascular necrosis, in the most susceptible joints in a cohort of these fishermen.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed radiographs of bilateral shoulders, hips, and knees of 39 fishermen in Mexico and surveyed them about their medical and diving histories. We performed pairwise correlations to examine if the fishermen's diving behaviours affected the numbers of joints with DON.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The radiographs revealed Grade II or higher DON in 30/39 (76.9%) of the fishermen. Twenty-two of 39 fishermen (56.4%) had at least two affected joints. The number of joints with DON positively correlates with the lifetime maximum diving depth and average bottom time.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings represent among the highest prevalence rates of DON in divers and reflect the wide-spread scale of decompression sickness among these fishermen. Through this work, we hope to further educate the fishermen on the sequelae of their diving with the aim of improving their diving safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325021/,2022-11-27 11:21:59 PM
Loeys-Dietz Syndrome,"Bart L Loeys, Harry C Dietz, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya, Bart L Loeys, Harry C Dietz, Margaret P Adam, David B Everman, Ghayda M Mirzaa, Roberta A Pagon, Stephanie E Wallace, Lora JH Bean, Karen W Gripp, Anne Amemiya",,"Clinical characteristics:
        
      
      Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is characterized by vascular findings (cerebral, thoracic, and abdominal arterial aneurysms and/or dissections), skeletal manifestations (pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum, scoliosis, joint laxity, arachnodactyly, talipes equinovarus, cervical spine malformation and/or instability), craniofacial features (widely spaced eyes, strabismus, bifid uvula / cleft palate, and craniosynostosis that can involve any sutures), and cutaneous findings (velvety and translucent skin, easy bruising, and dystrophic scars). Individuals with LDS are predisposed to widespread and aggressive arterial aneurysms and pregnancy-related complications including uterine rupture and death. Individuals with LDS can show a strong predisposition for allergic/inflammatory disease including asthma, eczema, and reactions to food or environmental allergens. There is also an increased incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation including eosinophilic esophagitis and gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Wide variation in the distribution and severity of clinical features can be seen in individuals with LDS, even among affected individuals within a family who have the same pathogenic variant.
    


          Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of LDS is established in individuals based on characteristic clinical findings in the proband and family members and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2.
    


          Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: Important considerations when managing cardiovascular features of LDS: aortic dissection can occur at smaller aortic diameters and at younger ages than observed in Marfan syndrome; vascular disease is not limited to the aortic root; angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, or other medications are used to reduce hemodynamic stress; and aneurysms are amenable to early and aggressive surgical intervention. Surgical fixation of cervical spine instability may be necessary to prevent spinal cord damage. Treatment is standard for clubfeet and severe pes planus. Management by a craniofacial team is preferred for treatment of cleft palate and craniosynostosis. Standard treatment for allergic complications with consideration of referral to an allergy/immunology specialist in severe cases. Careful and aggressive refraction and visual correction is mandatory in young children at risk for amblyopia. Hernias tend to recur after surgical intervention. A supporting mesh can be used during surgical repair to minimize recurrence risk. Optimal management of pneumothorax to prevent recurrence may require chemical or surgical pleurodesis or surgical removal of pulmonary blebs.
    

Prevention of secondary complications: Consider subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) prophylaxis in those undergoing dental work or other procedures expected to contaminate the bloodstream with bacteria. Because of high risk for cervical spine instability, a flexion/extension x-ray of the cervical spine should be performed prior to intubation or any other procedure involving manipulation of the neck.
    

Surveillance: All individuals with LDS require echocardiography at frequent intervals to monitor the status of the ascending aorta; the frequency of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) evaluation to image the entire arterial tree depends on clinical findings. Individuals with cervical spine instability and severe or progressive scoliosis should be followed by an orthopedist.
    

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system including routine use of decongestants or triptan medications for the management of migraine headache; activities that cause joint injury or pain; for individuals at risk for recurrent pneumothorax, breathing against a resistance (e.g., playing a brass instrument) or positive pressure ventilation (e.g., SCUBA diving).
    

Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the proband is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify genetic status of at-risk family members; if the pathogenic variant is not known, relatives at risk should be evaluated for signs of LDS, including echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging if findings suggest LDS or if findings were subtle in the index case.
    

Pregnancy management: Pregnancy and the postpartum period can be dangerous for women with LDS because of increased risk of aortic dissection/rupture and uterine rupture. Increased frequency of aortic imaging is recommended, both during pregnancy and in the weeks following delivery.
    

Therapies under investigation: The safety and efficacy of angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) has not been addressed for persons with LDS in a clinical trial setting, but ARBs have proven safe and comparable or superior to beta blockers in treating other vascular connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome.
    


          Genetic counseling:
        
      
      LDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 25% of individuals diagnosed with LDS have an affected parent; approximately 75% of probands have LDS as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with LDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and the disorder. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for LDS is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301312/,2022-11-27 11:22:00 PM
The future of diving research in Norway,"Andreas Møllerløkken, Andreas Møllerløkken",2018 Jun 30,"Norway has a long tradition of quality research within the field of baromedicine. With the discovery of oil in the North Sea, it became important to establish scientific research facilities to overcome immediate challenges, but also to work towards long-term goals. For the diving community, an understanding of the pathophysiology of decompression sickness (DCS) has been one of the major forces to maintain focus on the importance of scientific research in this field. In addition to oil, the aquaculture and fish farming industries are increasing in size and are Norway's second biggest export industry today. It also requires underwater workers for the inspection and repair of underwater structures and fishnets. The importance of health and safety for the underwater worker was identified early on by the offshore industry. The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority publishes a yearly report that identifies all offshore diving activity. The last reported incident of DCS was in 2002, whilst the last fatal saturation diving accident was in 1987. In-shore diving operations in Norway are regulated through the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority and here the track record is different; since 1979 there have been 28 fatalities, and they continue to occur. At the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), there has been a research group investigating barophysiology since the early 1980s. Led by Professor Alf O Brubakk, this research has been recognized internationally and has provided ground-breaking insights into the pathophysiology of DCS. This has included the identification of vascular gas bubbles through the use of ultrasound and identifying the importance of both protecting the vascular endothelium to maintain fitness to dive and also regular physical activity to reduce the risk of the adverse effects of diving. The group has educated many students, physiologists, engineers, medical doctors and researchers, all in the spirit of Professor Brubakk who considered that education was at least as important as the research itself. In 2008, Professor Brubakk was concerned about the future, as he was soon to retire. Great effort was put into perpetuating his position but this process ended when the University axed the only professorial position in environmental physiology in Norway. Today, there is only one non-permanent barophysiology research position at NTNU. This position and all research activity is dependent on external funding, so the education and research environment has changed drastically. Whilst there are clinicians in Norway working at different hyperbaric centres who participate in research related to barophysiology, this is not their primary task. With the lack of funding to include education and students in research, the rich history of barophysiological research at NTNU will be at an end. In Norway, the majority of grant-funded scientific programmes last only three years, so it has not been easy to recruit or to keep expertise between grants. So, who is planning for long-term research efforts in Norway? Whilst there are obvious challenges left to study in barophysiology, there is a lack of understanding amongst those responsible for decision-making and funding of the importance of having an academic-based research centre for diving research. NTNU, one of the world's most advanced hyperbaric laboratories, built up at considerable capital expense to investigate the pathophysiology of diving and decompression, is about to be closed and dismantled. At a time when the off-shore industry is putting greater focus on finding better solutions for safer underwater work environments, and in-shore diving is facing huge challenges due to a worrying level of serious accidents and increasing activity, there is no political drive in Norway to acknowledge the importance of maintaining the research facilities that support this industry. If the door does close on the NTNU facility, it will take many years and substantial funding to re-establish a modern research centre. Most importantly, it will be impossible to bring new students into the field of barophysiology in the foreseeable future. Whilst the off-shore oil industry has a finite future, aquaculture and other in-shore activities requiring diving support continue to expand. Good barophysiological research in established centres will be essential to support these industries into the future. Alf Brubakk often quoted an old Chinese proverb: ""When planning for a month, sow rice, when planning for a year, plant trees, when planning for a decade, train and educate men"". In Norway, we are only planting trees.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29888377/,2022-11-27 11:22:01 PM
Retrospective review of enquiries to the Québec diving medicine call centre: 2004 through 2018,"David Pm Monnott, Jocelyn Boisvert, Dominique Buteau, Neal W Pollock, David Pm Monnott, Jocelyn Boisvert, Dominique Buteau, Neal W Pollock",2021 Jun 30,"Introduction:
        
      
      The Centre de Médecine de Plongée du Québec (CMPQ) established a bilingual 24-hour dive emergency call line and diving medicine information service in 2004. The toll-free number (888-835-7121) works throughout Canada. Calls and emails (cmpq.cisssca@ssss.gouv.qc.ca) are answered by a CMPQ coordinator or on-call hyperbaric physicians and other consultants as needed. We reviewed 15 years of activity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Details of phone calls and email enquiries to the centre were reviewed individually and compiled into a database. Data were analysed to characterise contact volume and issues addressed. Contacts were categorised into five groups: information only (INF); medical opinion required (MOP); medical issue after the critical period of urgency had passed (PUR); current urgent but not immediate life-threatening issue (NLT); and immediate life- or health-threatening issue (ILT). Data presented as mean (standard deviation) or percentage.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3,232 contacts were made from May 2004 through December 2018: 19 (SD 8) per month [215 (70) per year]. Primary issues of concern were: emergency planning (20%); technical (not medical/physiology) questions (16%); otorhinolaryngological (12%); and decompression sickness-related (7%). Categorisation was 52% INF, 28% MOP, 13% PUR, 7% NLT, and 0.1% ILT, with 0.2% lacking sufficient detail to categorise. The nature of the diving activity of interest was determined in 67% of cases: 48% (n = 1,039) professional; 46% (n = 1,008) recreational; and 1% (n = 11) breath-hold.

      Sinus barotrauma is a common occurrence in diving and subaquatic medicine, potentially compromising dive safety. To gain a more thorough understanding of the condition, an in-depth investigation is justified.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a survey study. An anonymous, electronic questionnaire was distributed to 7,060 recipients: professional divers of the Finnish Border Guard, the Finnish Rescue Services, and the Finnish Heritage agency, as well as recreational divers registered as members of the Finnish Divers' Association reachable by email (roughly two-thirds of all members and recreational divers in Finland). Primary outcomes were self-reported prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health effects of sinus barotrauma while diving. Secondary outcomes were adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of sinus barotrauma with respect to possible risk factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 1,881 respondents participated in the study (response rate 27%). A total of 49% of the respondents had experienced sinus barotrauma while diving and of those affected, 32% had used medications to alleviate their symptoms. The factors associated with sinus barotrauma were pollen allergies (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.10-2.29), regular smoking (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.07-3.91) and a high number of upper respiratory tract infections per year (≥ 3 vs. < 3 infections per year: OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.79-4.24).

Diving with pre-existing medical conditions,"John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Jo Williams, Simon J Mitchell, John Lippmann, David McD Taylor, Christopher Stevenson, Jo Williams, Simon J Mitchell",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      This is the second report based on a survey of Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific (DAN AP) members who dive with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and diabetes. It examines the medical management of the divers' conditions, any diving modifications used to mitigate the risk and outcomes.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      An online cross-sectional survey was sent to 833 divers who had declared a targeted medical condition when applying for DAN AP membership between July 2009 and August 2013.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two-hundred-and-sixty-eight respondents (32%) provided sufficient information on their conditions to be included in the analyses. These included ischaemic heart disease (31), arrhythmias (20), cardiac septal defects (31), other cardiac conditions (10), hypertension (127), diabetes (25), asthma (40) and pneumothorax (5). Forty-nine per cent had sought specialist diving medical advice about their condition and 23% reported modifying their diving practices to mitigate their risk. The cohort had completed 183,069 career dives, 57,822 of these since being diagnosed with their medical condition. There were 27 individuals who reported having decompression illness (25 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with a persistent foramen ovale), and two individuals who experienced an arrhythmia during diving.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Some DAN AP members are diving with medical conditions which could potentially impact the safety of their diving. A minority modified their diving practices to mitigate the risk of their condition and approximately half sought specialist diving medical advice. The incidence of diving-related problems precipitated by known and managed pre-existing health conditions seems low but further studies of larger cohorts and incorporating fatality data would be necessary to confirm this. These results are limited by the 32% response rate and potential for bias towards selection of those most careful with their health.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868599/,2022-11-27 11:22:06 PM
Amplatzer patent foramen ovale occluder: safety and efficacy,"Raouf Madhkour, Andreas Wahl, Fabien Praz, Bernhard Meier, Raouf Madhkour, Andreas Wahl, Fabien Praz, Bernhard Meier",2019 Mar,"The patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common anatomical variant in humans (prevalence 25%). Most often asymptomatic, it may engender paradoxically embolic strokes, myocardial infarctions, or visceral or peripheral ischemia. It is causatively related to migraine, positional or exertional hypoxemia with dyspnea, diving incidents, high altitude edema, and sleep apnea. Percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects was first performed in the seventies. A dedicated PFO occluder (Amplatzer PFO Occluder) was first used on 10 September 1997 by Kurt Amplatz and Bernhard Meier. Since, percutaneous PFO closure has evolved into one of the most common and the simplest and safest catheter-based intervention in adult cardiology. Randomized studies have proved its benefit for prevention of recurrent ischemic events (particularly strokes) in patients without competing stroke etiology. There are also supportive clinical data for PFO closure in other situations.

Epilepsy and physical exercise,"José Pimentel, Raquel Tojal, Joana Morgado, José Pimentel, Raquel Tojal, Joana Morgado",2015 Feb,"Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurologic diseases and has always been associated with stigma. In the interest of safety, the activities of persons with epilepsy (PWE) are often restricted. In keeping with this, physical exercise has often been discouraged. The precise nature of a person's seizures (or whether seizures were provoked or unprovoked) may not have been considered. Although there has been a change in attitude over the last few decades, the exact role of exercise in inducing seizures or aggravating epilepsy still remains a matter of discussion among experts in the field. Based mainly on retrospective, but also on prospective, population and animal-based research, the hypothesis that physical exercise is prejudicial has been slowly replaced by the realization that physical exercise might actually be beneficial for PWE. The benefits are related to improvement of physical and mental health parameters and social integration and reduction in markers of stress, epileptiform activity and the number of seizures. Nowadays, the general consensus is that there should be no restrictions to the practice of physical exercise in people with controlled epilepsy, except for scuba diving, skydiving and other sports at heights. Whilst broader restrictions apply for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, individual risk assessments taking into account the seizure types, frequency, patterns or triggers may allow PWE to enjoy a wide range of physical activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458104/,2022-11-27 11:22:11 PM

      COVID-19 may cause severe pneumonitis and trigger a massive inflammatory response that requires ventilatory support. The intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality has been reported to be as high as 62%. Dexamethasone is the only of all anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested to date that has shown a positive effect on mortality. We aim to explore if treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe and effective for patients with severe COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that HBO can prevent ICU admission, morbidity and mortality by attenuating the inflammatory response. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBO reduces the number of ICU admissions compared with best practice treatment for COVID-19, main secondary objectives are to evaluate if HBO reduces the load on ICU resources, morbidity and mortality and to evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      A randomised, controlled, phase II, open label, multicentre trial. 200 subjects with severe COVID-19 and at least two risk factors for mortality will be included. Baseline clinical data and blood samples will be collected before randomisation and repeated daily for 7 days, at days 14 and 30. Subjects will be randomised with a computer-based system to HBO, maximum five times during the first 7 days plus best practice treatment or only best practice treatment. The primary endpoint, ICU admission, is defined by criteria for selection for ICU. We will evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 using molecular analyses. All parameters are recorded in an electronic case report form. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the safety parameters.

Divers were contacted via a combination of phone, text, mail and email. Data collected included: diving habits (years, style and depths); DCS symptoms, signs and treatment; return to diving and modifications of dive practices; history of migraine and echocardiography (ECHO) pre- and post-intervention; ECHO technique(s) used, and success or failure of PFO closure (PFOC). Analyses were performed to compare the incidence of DCS pre- and post-PFO diagnosis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-three divers were interviewed. Sixty-eight of these returned to diving following the diagnosis of PFO. Thirty-eight underwent PFOC and chose to adopt conservative diving practices (CDPs); 15 chose PFOC with no modification to practices; 15 adopted CDPs alone; and five have discontinued diving. The incidence of DCS decreased significantly following PFOC and/or adoption of conservative diving practices. Of interest, migraine with aura resolved in almost all those who underwent PFOC.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Many divers had already adopted practices consistent with the 2015 JPS permitting the resumption of scuba diving with a lowering of the incidence of DCS to that of the general diving population. These results support the recommendations of the JPS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325017/,2022-11-27 11:22:15 PM

Lessons from a historic example of diving safety rules violation: the case of Greek sponge divers,"Costas Tsiamis, Georgia Vrioni, Athanassios Tsakris, Costas Tsiamis, Georgia Vrioni, Athanassios Tsakris",2020,"This study presents a historical example of systematic safety rules violations by professional sponge divers in Greece during the early 20th century. In light of absolute unaccountability in favour of economic competition and in the absence of state oversight, the profession of sponge diving had developed into a deadly undertaking. The study is based on a report compiled by Professor of Hygiene and Microbiology Konstantinos Savvas, which was addressed to the Ministry of Marine Affairs. Savvas' report rested on data concerning hospitalised divers derived from the medical records of warship 'Kriti' (Crete), which escorted groups of Greek fishing vessels to four of their expedition in the Mediterranean over the period 1900-1903. Although the events explored herein took place at a time much different from the modern era with its numerous advancements in hyperbaric medicine, enhanced divers' professionalism and the establishment of labour rights and strict safety regulations, we should not overlook the human factor of professional exploitation that leads to the violation of safety rules. On the other hand, supervisory authorities entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing professional activities ought to be vigilant on a constant basis, especially in times of economic crisis that may lead to lax state functioning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32212145/,2022-11-27 11:22:17 PM

The impact of regular diving on the condition of the middle ear,"Olgierd Stieler, Wawrzyniec Loba, Wojciech Gawęcki, Marta Urbaniak-Olejnik, Anna Majewska, Wojciech Warchoł, Dorota Hojan-Jezierska, Olgierd Stieler, Wawrzyniec Loba, Wojciech Gawęcki, Marta Urbaniak-Olejnik, Anna Majewska, Wojciech Warchoł, Dorota Hojan-Jezierska",2021 Dec 13,"Objectives:
        
      
      It is generally held that exposure to both high-pressure and long-lasting contact with water makes diving a potentially hazardous sports activity as far as the ears are concerned. There is a number of research investigating the condition of the middle ear in a short period following diving; however, the knowledge regarding the long-term effects of regularly repeated diving remains limited.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the function of the middle ear after a diving season in a group of 31 adults diving regularly (1-17 years) by means of the following methods: 1) interview, 2) otoscopy, 3) pure tone audiometry, 4) classic tympanometry, and 5) wideband tympanometry.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Periodic problems with pressure equalization in the middle ear were observed in 12 individuals (38.7%). In all the analyzed cases, the authors found a normal condition of the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane in otoscopy, normal hearing in pure tone audiometry, curve type A, and normal gradient in both classic and wideband tympanometry.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Safe diving (according to safety precautions) does not have any long-term negative effects on the condition of the middle ear. However, these observations should be verified in a larger group of divers.

"Scuba diving-related fatalities in New Zealand, 2007 to 2016","John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Michael Davis, John Lippmann, Christopher Lawrence, Michael Davis",2021 Dec 20,"Introduction:
        
      
      New Zealand (NZ) diving-related fatalities have been reported since the 1960s. The aim is to identify contributing risk factors, including medical, and to inform appropriate preventative strategies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      NZ scuba diving fatalities from 2007 to 2016 were searched from multiple sources - the National Coronial Information System (NCIS); the NZ Chief Coroner's office; Water Safety NZ Drownbase™ and the NZ Police National Dive Squad records. For inclusion, a victim must have been wearing a scuba set (which may include a rebreather). A key word search of the NCIS was made and the results matched to the other databases. An Excel® database was created and a chain of events analysis (CEA) conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-eight scuba diving fatalities were identified, 40 men and eight women, average age 47 years (range 17-68), 20 of Māori ethnicity. Thirty-five were classified as overweight (14) or obese (21). Pre-existing medical risk factors were identified, either pre dive or at autopsy, in 37 divers, the commonest being ischaemic heart disease (IHD, 20), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, 18) and hypertension (seven). IHD, LVH and obesity were variously associated with each other. The likely commonest disabling conditions, identified in 32 cases, were asphyxia (15), cardiac (nine) and pulmonary barotrauma/cerebral arterial gas embolism (five). Multiple environmental and diving practice breaches and poor planning were identified in the CEA, similar to those seen in other studies. Thirty-eight divers had not released their weight belt. Information on resuscitation was limited.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Obesity and cardiovascular disease were common and Māori appear to be over-represented, both as previously reported.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897599/,2022-11-27 11:22:22 PM

Middle ear barotrauma in diving,"Oskari H Lindfors, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Jari Suvilehto, Saku T Sinkkonen, Oskari H Lindfors, Anne K Räisänen-Sokolowski, Jari Suvilehto, Saku T Sinkkonen",2021 Mar 31,"Introduction:
        
      
      Middle ear barotrauma (MEBt) is the most common medical complication in diving, posing a serious risk to dive safety. Given this prevalence and the continuing growth of the diving industry, a comprehensive overview of the condition is warranted.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a survey study. An anonymous, electronic questionnaire was distributed to 7,060 recipients: professional divers of the Finnish Border Guard, the Finnish Rescue Services, and the Finnish Heritage agency; and recreational divers registered as members of the Finnish Divers' Association reachable by e-mail (roughly two-thirds of all members and recreational divers in Finland). Primary outcomes were self-reported prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health effects of MEBt while diving. Secondary outcomes were adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of MEBt with respect to possible risk factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,881 respondents participated in the study (response rate 27%). In total, 81% of the respondents had experienced MEBt while diving. Of those affected, 38% had used medications and 1% had undergone otorhinolaryngology-related surgical procedures due to MEBt. Factors most associated with MEBt were poor subjective success in Valsalva ('occasionally' versus 'always' successful: OR 11.56; 95% CI 7.24-18.47) and Toynbee ('occasionally' versus 'always' successful: OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.95-6.30) manoeuvres.
    


          Conclusions:

Violations of safe diving practices among 122 diver fatalities,"Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Mark Caney, Karl Shreeves, Peter Buzzacott, Al Hornsby, Mark Caney",2018,"Background:
        
      
      Diving is a popular recreation with an excellent safety record, with an estimated 1.8 deaths per 1 million dives. This study investigated the relationship between intentional deviation from accepted diving practices (violations) and diver fatalities.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The authors examined 119 incidents/122 diver fatalities that did not involve diver training in North America and the Caribbean, and identified the presence of violations of accepted diving safety practices, as well as if the death was associated with an acute medical event such as heart attack.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 122 fatalities, 57% (n = 70) were associated with a medical event and 43% (n = 52) were non-medical. Violations were found in 45% of fatalities (n = 55) overall. Violations were recorded for 23% of the 70 medical and 75% of the 52 non-medical fatalities. Divers who died from something other than a medical cause were 7 times as likely to have one or more violations associated with the fatality (OR 7.3, 95% CI 2.3-23.2). The odds of dying from something other than a medical condition increased approximately 60% for each additional 10 metres of depth. The odds of a death being associated with a medical condition increased approximately 9% per year of age, or 2.4 times for every 10 years older a diver was.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Medical events are associated with over half of the non-training related diver fatalities in North America and the Caribbean, with the odds of death being associated with a medical condition doubling each decade of additional age. These data support recommendations that divers stay physically fit and have regular medical checkups, particularly as they get older. They also strongly support the safety benefit of adhering to established safe diving practices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29939385/,2022-11-27 11:22:27 PM
"Turkish recreational divers: a comparative study of their demographics, diving habits, health and attitudes towards safety","Bengusu Mirasoglu, Samil Aktas, Bengusu Mirasoglu, Samil Aktas",2017 Sep,"Introduction:
        
      
      In Turkey, scuba diving has become more popular and accessible in the past decade and there has been a commensurate rise in the number of certified divers. This new generation of recreational divers has not been described in detail previously. The aim of this study was to profile this group, while investigating any gender differences and making comparisons with the global diving community.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Turkish dive club members and diving forum⁄blog readers were invited to complete an online questionnaire investigating their demography, medical issues and diving history and habits.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The questionnaire was completed by 303 female and 363 male divers. Significant differences were found between the sexes in terms of demographics, diving experience and attitudes toward safety. Previous or ongoing medical conditions were reported by 100 female divers and 141 males. Only 29% of females and 22% of males had been examined by a physician trained to conduct assessments of fitness to dive. Female divers did not report problems while diving during menstruation or while taking oral contraceptives. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of decompression sickness (DCS) and DCS-like symptoms between the sexes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the largest study to date conducted on recreational divers in Turkey and so carries some value. It profiles their physical and behavioral attributes as well as differences in diving practices between the sexes in Turkey.

Recreational diving in persons with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: Advancing capabilities and recommendations,"Johan H Jendle, Peter Adolfsson, Neal W Pollock, Johan H Jendle, Peter Adolfsson, Neal W Pollock",2020 Jun 30,"Diving by persons with diabetes has long been conducted, with formal guidelines published in the early 1990s. Subsequent consensus guidelines produced following a 2005 workshop helped to advance the recognition of relevant issues and promote discussion. The guidelines were intended as an interim step in guidance, with the expectation that revisions should follow the gathering of additional data and experience. Recent and ongoing developments in pharmacology and technology can further aid in reducing the risk of hypoglycemia, a critical acute concern of diving with diabetes. Careful and periodic evaluation remains crucial to ensure that participation in diving activity is appropriate. Close self-monitoring, thoughtful adjustments of medications and meals, and careful review of the individual response to diving can assist in optimising control and ensuring safety. Open communication with diving partners, support personnel, and medical monitors is important to ensure that all are prepared to effectively assist in case of need. Ongoing vigilance, best practice, including graduated clearance for diving exposures and adverse event reporting, are all required to ensure the safety of diving with diabetes and to promote community understanding and acceptance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32557415/,2022-11-27 11:22:29 PM
Simulated High Altitude Helium-Oxygen Diving,"Lu Shi, Yan-Meng Zhang, Katsuura Tetsuo, Zhong-Yuan Shi, Yi-Qun Fang, Petar J Denoble, Yang-Yang Li, Lu Shi, Yan-Meng Zhang, Katsuura Tetsuo, Zhong-Yuan Shi, Yi-Qun Fang, Petar J Denoble, Yang-Yang Li",2017 Dec 1,"Background:
        
      
      Experience with commercial heliox diving at high altitude is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute high-altitude exposure on fitness to dive and the safety of decompression after heliox diving while using U.S. Navy heliox decompression tables with Cross correction.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Four professional male divers were consecutively decompressed in a hypo- and hyperbaric chamber to altitudes of 3000 m (9842.5 ft), 4000 m (13,123.4 ft), and 5200 m (17,060.4 ft) during the 8-d study. The dive profiles tested were to 30 m (98.4 ft) for 60 min at all three altitudes and, in addition, a dive to 50 m (164 ft) for 60 min at 5200 m altitude. The decompression followed the U.S. Navy heliox decompression table. The safety of decompression was evaluated by precordial Doppler venous gas emboli (VGE) monitoring during the decompression stages and postdive monitoring of the divers for symptoms of decompression sickness (DCS). Effects of altitude exposure were measured as subjective rating and EEG signs of sleepiness and fatigue, clinical symptoms of high altitude disease, and fitness to dive.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 24 person-dives were conducted. There were no VGE detected during the decompression and no postdive symptoms of decompression illness. Both the EEG findings and subjective evaluation indicated increased sleepiness and fatigue at 3000 m, 4000 m, and 5200 m, all compared with the sea level baseline. During the diving phase, both the EEG findings and subjective evaluation scores returned to the baseline and the divers successfully completed diving.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Diving at high altitude with a short acclimatization period appears safe despite divers exhibiting clinical symptoms and EEG signs of impairment by hypoxia at high altitude. Despite a small number of dives, the results of this study indicate that our application of U.S. Navy standard heliox decompression tables with Cross correction is effective and could be used for underwater constructions up to 5200 m altitude, with due caution.Shi L, Zhang Y, Tetsuo K, Shi Z, Fang Y, Denoble PJ, Li Y.

Vascular Function Recovery Following Saturation Diving,"Jean-Pierre Imbert, Salih-Murat Egi, Costantino Balestra, Jean-Pierre Imbert, Salih-Murat Egi, Costantino Balestra",2022 Oct 17,"Background and Objectives: Saturation diving is a technique used in commercial diving. Decompression sickness (DCS) was the main concern of saturation safety, but procedures have evolved over the last 50 years and DCS has become a rare event. New needs have evolved to evaluate the diving and decompression stress to improve the flexibility of the operations (minimum interval between dives, optimal oxygen levels, etc.). We monitored this stress in saturation divers during actual operations. Materials and Methods: The monitoring included the detection of vascular gas emboli (VGE) and the changes in the vascular function measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) after final decompression to surface. Monitoring was performed onboard a diving support vessel operating in the North Sea at typical storage depths of 120 and 136 msw. A total of 49 divers signed an informed consent form and participated to the study. Data were collected on divers at surface, before the saturation and during the 9 h following the end of the final decompression. Results: VGE were detected in three divers at very low levels (insignificant), confirming the improvements achieved on saturation decompression procedures. As expected, the FMD showed an impairment of vascular function immediately at the end of the saturation in all divers but the divers fully recovered from these vascular changes in the next 9 following hours, regardless of the initial decompression starting depth. Conclusion: These changes suggest an oxidative/inflammatory dimension to the diving/decompression stress during saturation that will require further monitoring investigations even if the vascular impairement is found to recover fast.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36295636/,2022-11-27 11:22:32 PM
"DAN Annual Diving Report 2019 Edition: A report on 2017 diving fatalities, injuries, and incidents [Internet]","Petar J. Denoble, Petar J. Denoble",,"The format of Edition 2019 is similar to that of previous editions. In Section One, we present 2017 fatality data. At the beginning of this section are summary statistics for fatalities in the U.S. and Canada followed by a series of case studies that offer further insight into causes.
    

      
      This year’s report features enhanced spatial/geographic data. Section Two includes a series of maps of fatal and nonfatal dive-related injuries around the U.S. and the world. For the first time, we have county-level data in Florida and California, the states with the most diving. These popular dive destinations accommodate various scuba diving activities, including wreck diving and underwater harvesting. We are pleased to have reached this level of geospatial analysis and will continue to work with public health officials in these counties for the next 10 years.
    

      
      In Section Three we present the summary statistics of nonfatal injuries, based on data from the DAN Medical Services Call Center, as well as an in-depth review of select cases. Section Four focuses on incident reports, most of which did not involve any injury, provided voluntarily by divers. The breath-hold diving portion of the report follows in Section Five. DAN employs various injury and fatality prevention strategies, so we added a section, Section Six, about training programs, which target individual divers, and hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) programs, which promote operational safety.
    

      
      The addition of enhanced geographic data is a step forward for the report, but there is always more to do. Among the improvements we are considering for the coming years are interactive digital maps of injuries and fatalities, a revamping of the dive incident reporting system, an enhanced coding system for increased granularity, inclusion of diving-adjacent activities (such as topside accidents involving scuba cylinders) and greater coordination with training agencies and other organizations to standardize reporting and capture even more incidents.
    

      
      Our data revealed some interesting themes. For one, cardiovascular disease was present in many of the available autopsy reports. We also noted that fatalities occurred in people of various certification levels and participation frequency and that a significant number of deaths occur at shallow depths. Analysis by DAN experts revealed that a better understanding of cardiovascular disease and the buddy system’s role in dive fatalities is crucial.
    

      
      Dive fatalities are complex and poorly understood. If similar medical conditions and circumstances were to appear in a person outside of the water, death might be attributed to a chronic disease. Because symptoms presented in the water, however, the fatality is often attributed to diving. It is this complexity that makes it so challenging for scientists to decipher the risk factors and spurious associations in fatal and nonfatal dive accidents.
    

      
      It is not surprising that nonfatal scuba injuries occur with greater frequency than fatalities. The challenge in analyzing the trends and distribution of scuba injuries is identifying who is diving and how frequently.
    

      
      The analysis of the data on fatal and nonfatal breath-hold diving injuries yielded several insights. Notably, men were more often involved in breath-hold incidents than women, and people in their twenties and thirties were more often involved than people in other age groups. Divers over forty years of age, however, were more often involved in breath-hold fatalities. Breath-hold diving activities range from what could be described as child’s play to competitive freediving involving highly trained divers that push the limits of the human body. No matter the dive depth, it is vital that breath-hold divers understand the body’s reaction to diving. While chronic disease may have played a role in some of the analyzed cases, there is also reason to believe that some deaths were due to miscalculations of the individuals’ ability to hold their breath long enough to return to the surface.
    

      
      To prevent injury and loss of life, change must happen at various levels. We continue to expand our outreach to divers and dive professionals through training and risk management programs. DAN’s first aid and HIRA programs are the most relevant, detailed, and comprehensive such programs in the industry.

      New Zealand's (NZ) long coastline offers a diverse underwater environment with abundant opportunities for harvesting seafood and for recreation. Fatalities from snorkelling/breath-hold diving have been reported from the 1960s through to 2006. Those from 2007 to 2016 are reported here.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The National Coronial Information System, the Australasian Diving Safety Foundation diving fatality database, and the Water Safety NZ ""Drownbase"" were searched and additional coronial data provided by the NZ Ministry of Justice. An anonymised database was created and analysed for multiple factors. A chain of events analysis was performed for each case.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 38 snorkelling or breath-hold-related deaths in NZ, 33 men and five women. Twenty-nine were breath-hold divers involved in gathering seafood, and six 'surface snorkellers', predominantly sightseeing. Two-thirds were diving alone and/or were not being observed by anyone out of the water. Twenty-eight victims were classified as overweight or obese and 19/38 were Maori. Pre-existing health factors that may have or definitely contributed to the fatality were present in 30 cases. The most common of these were cardiac (18/38). Two divers had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, one each epilepsy and asthma whilst cannabis and/or alcohol were possible factors in seven deaths. Five (possibly six) deaths resulted from apnoeic hypoxia.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, death from snorkelling/breath-hold diving was an uncommon event (38 in 10 years). Poor judgement was a common feature. Middle-aged Maori men with pre-existing disease feature strongly. This suggests an on-going need for appropriate water safety education within and beyond the Maori community.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33761538/,2022-11-27 11:22:33 PM
Travel medicine for divers,"Krzysztof Korzeniewski, Jarosław Krzyżak, Krzysztof Korzeniewski, Jarosław Krzyżak",2017,"Recreational diving is increasing in popularity globally, also among European travellers. Since a majority of popular diving sites are located in tropical or subtropical destinations commonly characterised by harsh climate and poor sanitation, travellers planning to engage in recreational diving are recommended to take certain health prevention measures to reduce travel-associated health risks. They need to be aware of the fact that diving can threaten their lives or even be fatal; however, if they are well prepared physically and mentally and follow all the recommended safety rules while underwater, diving is an unforgettable experience that cannot be compared to any other sports activity performed on land. Before going on a diving trip, it is important to make the necessary arrangements, bearing in mind they should not only concentrate on diving-related activities (the marine environment) but also on other aspects, e.g. contact with terrestrial flora and fauna. Therefore, the health prevention measures (a pre-travel consultation, vaccinations, antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, a properly prepared travel health kit and travel insurance) are to keep a traveller healthy during the entire travel and not just the moments of going underwater. The most important of the pre-travel arrangements include pre-travel medical evaluation, selecting and preparing medications for chronic conditions and assembling the first aid kit for personal use. Travellers are recommended to have a pre-travel consultation in medical facilities whose personnel have an appropriate level of knowledge and expertise on hyperbaric, tropical and travel medicine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29297573/,2022-11-27 11:22:34 PM
