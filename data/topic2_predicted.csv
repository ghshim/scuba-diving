0,Promises and trust in human-robot interaction,"Understanding human trust in machine partners has become imperative due to the widespread use of intelligent machines in a variety of applications and contexts. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether human-beings trust a social robot-i.e. a human-like robot that embodies emotional states, empathy, and non-verbal communication-differently than other types of agents. To do so, we adapt the well-known economic trust-game proposed by Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) to assess whether receiving a promise from a robot increases human-trust in it. We find that receiving a promise from the robot increases the trust of the human in it, but only for individuals who perceive the robot very similar to a human-being. Importantly, we observe a similar pattern in choices when we replace the humanoid counterpart with a real human but not when it is replaced by a computer-box. Additionally, we investigate participants' psychophysiological reaction in terms of cardiovascular and electrodermal activity. Our results highlight an increased psychophysiological arousal when the game is played with the social robot compared to the computer-box. Taken all together, these results strongly support the development of technologies enhancing the humanity of robots.",4
1,Under Pressure: Examining Social Conformity With Computer and Robot Groups,"Objective:
        
      
      The authors investigate whether nonhuman agents, such as computers or robots, produce a social conformity effect in human operators and examine to what extent potential conformist behavior varies as a function of the human-likeness of the group members and the type of task that has to be performed.
    


          Background:
        
      
      People conform due to normative and/or informational motivations in human-human interactions, and conformist behavior is modulated by factors related to the individual as well as factors associated with the group, context, and culture. Studies have yet to examine whether nonhuman agents also induce social conformity.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Participants were assigned to a computer, robot, or human group and completed both a social and analytical task with the respective group.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Conformity measures (percentage of times participants answered in line with agents on critical trials) subjected to a 3 × 2 mixed ANOVA showed significantly higher conformity rates for the analytical versus the social task as well as a modulation of conformity depending of the perceived agent-task fit.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Findings indicate that nonhuman agents were able to exert a social conformity effect, which was modulated further by the perceived match between agent and task type. Participants conformed to comparable degrees with agents during the analytical task but conformed significantly more strongly on the social task as the group's human-likeness increased.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Results suggest that users may react differently to the influence of nonhuman agent groups with the potential for variability in conformity depending on the domain of the task.",4
2,The Validation of a Novel Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Virtual Reality Module,"Objective:
        
      
      To perform the first validation of a full procedural virtual reality robotic training module and analysis of novice surgeon's learning curves.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Participants completed the bladder neck dissection task and urethrovesical anastomosis task (UVA) as part of the prostatectomy module. Surgeons completed feedback questionnaires assessing the realism, content, acceptability and feasibility of the module. Novice surgeons completed a 5.5-hour training programme using both tasks.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      King's College London, London.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      13 novice, 24 intermediate and 8 expert surgeons completed the validation study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Realism was scored highly for BDN (mean 3.4/5) and UVA (3.74/5), as was importance of BDN (4.32/5) and UVA (4.6/5) for training. It was rated as a feasible (3.95/5) and acceptable (4/5) tool for training. Experts performed significantly better than novice group in 6 metrics in the UVA including time (p = 0.0005), distance by camera (p = 0.0010) and instrument collisions (p = 0.0033), as well as task-specific metrics such as number of unnecessary needle piercing points (p = 0.0463). In novice surgeons, a significant improvement in performance after training was seen in many metrics for both tasks. For bladder neck dissection task, this included time (p < 0.0001), instrument collisions (p = 0.0013) and total time instruments are out of view (p = 0.0251). For UVA, this included time (p = 0.0135), instrument collisions (p = 0.0066) and task-specific metrics such as injury to the urethra (p = 0.0032) and bladder (p = 0.0189).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surgeons found this full procedural VR training module to be a realistic, feasible and acceptable component for a robotic surgical training programme. Construct validity was proven between expert and novice surgeons. Novice surgeons have shown a significant learning curve over 5.5 hours of training, suggesting this module could be used in a surgical curriculum for acquisition of technical skills. Further implementation of this module into the curriculum and continued analysis would be beneficial to gauge how it can be fully utilised.",1
3,Facilitating robotic thymectomy in patients with pectus excavatum deformity,"Robotic procedures in the anterior mediastinum can be challenging in the existence of pectus excavatum deformity due to the limited intrathoracic working space caused by sternal depression. We propose that the temporary application of a vacuum bell device during the procedure can correct the deformity and thus, facilitate robotic approach similarly to the standard procedure.",3
4,Comparison of manual versus robot-assisted contralateral gate cannulation in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair,"Purpose:
        
      
      Robotic endovascular technology may offer advantages over conventional manual catheter techniques. Our aim was to compare the endovascular catheter path-length (PL) for robotic versus manual contralateral gate cannulation during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), using video motion analysis (VMA).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a multicentre retrospective cohort study with fluoroscopic video recordings of 24 EVAR cases (14 robotic, 10 manual) performed by experienced operators (> 50 procedures), obtained from four leading European centres. Groups were comparable with no statistically significant differences in aneurysm size (p = 0.47) or vessel tortuosity (p = 0.68). Two trained assessors used VMA to calculate the catheter PL during contralateral gate cannulation for robotic versus manual approaches.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was a high degree of inter-observer reliability (Cronbach's α > 0.99) for VMA. Median robotic PL was 35.7 cm [interquartile range, IQR (30.8-51.0)] versus 74.1 cm [IQR (44.3-170.4)] for manual cannulation, p = 0.019. Robotic cases had a median cannulation time of 5.33 min [IQR (4.58-6.49)] versus 1.24 min [IQR (1.13-1.35)] in manual cases (p = 0.0083). Generated efficiency ratios (PL/aorto-iliac centrelines) was 1.6 (1.2-2.1) in robotic cases versus 2.6 (1.7-7.0) in manual, p = 0.031.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robot-assisted contralateral gate cannulation in EVAR leads to decreased navigation path lengths and increased economy of movement compared with manual catheter techniques. The benefit could be maximised by prioritising robotic catheter shaping over habituated reliance on guidewire manipulation. Robotic technology has the potential to reduce the endovascular footprint during manipulations even for experienced operators with the added advantage of zero radiation exposure.",0
5,"Preclinical evaluation of the versius surgical system, a new robot-assisted surgical device for use in minimal access general and colorectal procedures","Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the utility of a new robot-assisted surgical system (the Versius Surgical System, CMR Surgical, Cambridge, UK) for use in minimal access general and colorectal surgery, in a preclinical setting. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has been developed to overcome some of the important limitations of conventional laparoscopy. The new system is designed to assist surgeons in performing minimal access surgery and overcome some of the challenges associated with currently available surgical robots.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Cadaveric sessions were conducted to evaluate the ability of the system to provide adequate surgical access and reach required to complete a range of general and colorectal procedures. Port and bedside unit positions were recorded, and surgical access and reach were evaluated by the lead surgeon using a visual analogue scale. A live animal (porcine) model was used to assess the surgical device's safety in performing cholecystectomy or small bowel enterotomy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine types of procedure were performed in cadavers by nine lead surgeons; 35/38 procedures were completed successfully. The positioning of ports and bedside units reflected the lead surgeons' preferred laparoscopic set-up and enabled good surgical access and reach. Cholecystectomy (n = 6) and small bowel enterotomy (n = 5) procedures performed in pigs were all completed successfully by two surgeons. There were no device-related intra-operative complications.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This preclinical study of a new robot-assisted surgical system for minimal access general and colorectal surgery demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the system in cadaver and porcine models. Further studies are required to assess its clinical utility.",1
6,Erectile Function and Oncologic Outcomes Following Open Retropubic and Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results from the LAParoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Whether surgeons perform better utilising a robot-assisted laparoscopic technique compared with an open approach during prostate cancer surgery is debatable.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To report erectile function and early oncologic outcomes for both surgical modalities, stratified by prostate cancer risk grouping.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      In a prospective nonrandomised trial, we recruited 2545 men with prostate cancer from seven open (n=753) and seven robot-assisted (n=1792) Swedish centres (2008-2011).
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Clinometrically-validated questionnaire-based patient-reported erectile function was collected before, 3 mo, 12 mo, and 24 mo after surgery. Surgeon-reported degree of neurovascular-bundle preservation, pathologist-reported positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, and 2-yr prostate-specific antigen-relapse rates were measured.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Among 1702 preoperatively potent men, we found enhanced erectile function recovery for low/intermediate-risk patients in the robot-assisted group at 3 mo. For patients with high-risk tumours, point estimates for erectile function recovery at 24 mo favoured the open surgery group. The degree of neurovascular bundle preservation and erectile function recovery were greater correlated for robot-assisted surgery. In pT2 tumours, 10% versus 17% PSM rates were observed for open and robot-assisted surgery, respectively; corresponding rates for pT3 tumours were 48% and 33%. These differences were associated with biochemical recurrence in pT3 but not pT2 disease. The study is limited by its nonrandomised design and relatively short follow-up.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Earlier recovery of erectile function in the robot-assisted surgery group in lower-risk patients is counterbalanced by lower PSM rates for open surgeons in organ-confined disease; thus, both open and robotic surgeons need to consider this trade-off when determining the plane of surgical dissection. Robot-assisted surgery also facilitates easier identification of nerve preservation planes during radical prostatectomy as well as wider dissection for pT3 cases.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      For prostate cancer surgery, an open operation reduces erection problems in high-risk cancers but has higher relapse rates than robotic surgery. Relapse rates appear similar in low/intermediate-risk cancers and the robot appears better at preserving erections in these cases.",2
7,Role of Robotics in Children: A brave New World!,"Context:
        
      
      The key in the evolution towards minimally invasive surgery is the availability of appropriate equipment, especially when procedures involve children. While robotic procedures in adults continue to struggle to prove measurable advantages compared with open or classical laparoscopic ones, the use of the robotic platform (RP) in pediatric urology is steadily increasing.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To review the contemporary literature regarding the use of robotic-assisted (RA) urologic interventions in children.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A nonsystematic review of the literature was conducted through PubMed database between 2002 and 2017, with an emphasis on large series.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      A few major challenges must be considered before using the RP in children: anesthesia, placement of trocars, and technical difficulties related to small space. To date, only the robot-assisted pyeloplasty is recognized as safe and efficient with an equivalent outcome compared to the open or classical laparoscopy; this was supported by large multicentric studies, which are not available for most of the other procedures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RA procedure in children has been proven safe and effective. Still in its infancy, further data over time is likely to prove different RA procedures to be equivalent to open or laparoscopy in terms of outcome.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      The advent of the robotic platform means an evolution towards minimizing surgical trauma for the child. Currently, the available platforms designed for adults are adapted to work in children. However, it might be expected in the future that new technologies will improve the technical possibilities to improve the robotic platform for minimally invasive surgery in children. To date, a few applications are considered safe and efficient (in experienced hands), considering that the team has to be aware of some challenges to overcome regarding anesthesia, material, and technique adaptation to the patient. The most accepted robotic applications in children comprises of the robot-assisted pyeloplasty, hemi-nephrectomy, and ureteric reimplantation.",1
8,Long-term first-in-man Phase I/II study of an adjuvant dendritic cell vaccine in patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PC) can experience biochemical relapse (BCR), despite surgery, and develop noncurative disease. The present study aimed to reduce the risk of BCR with a personalized dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, given as adjuvant therapy, after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve weeks after RALP, 20 patients with high-risk PC and undetectable PSA received DC vaccinations for 3 years or until BCR. The primary endpoint was the time to BCR. The immune response was assessed 7 weeks after surgery (baseline) and at one-time point during the vaccination period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 20 patients, 11 were BCR-free over a median of 96 months (range: 84-99). The median time from the end of vaccinations to the last follow-up was 57 months (range: 45-60). Nine patients developed BCR, either during (n = 4) or after (n = 5) the vaccination period. Among five patients diagnosed with intraductal carcinoma, three experienced early BCR during the vaccination period. All patients that developed BCR remained in stable disease within a median of 99 months (range: 74-99). The baseline immune response was significantly associated with the immune response during the vaccination period (p = 0.015). For patients diagnosed with extraprostatic extension (EPE), time to BCR was longer in vaccine responders than in non-responders (p = 0.09). Among 12 patients with the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 5 PC, five achieved remission after 84 months, and all mounted immune responses.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients diagnosed with EPE and ISUP grade 5 PC were at particularly high risk of developing postsurgical BCR. In this subgroup, the vaccine response was related to a reduced BCR incidence. The vaccine was safe, without side effects. This adjuvant first-in-man Phase I/II DC vaccine study showed promising results. DC vaccines after curative surgery should be investigated further in a larger cohort of patients with high-risk PC.",2
9,Utility of the Iwate difficulty scoring system for laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy: do surgical outcomes differ for tumors in segments VI and VII?,"Introduction:
        
      
      The Iwate Score (IS) have not been well-validated for specific procedures, especially for right posterior sectionectomy (RPS). In this study, the utility of the IS was determined for laparoscopic (L)RPS and the effect of tumor location on surgical outcomes was investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Post-hoc analysis of 647 L-RPS performed in 40 international centers of which 596L-RPS cases met the inclusion criteria. Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes of patients stratified based on the Iwate score were compared to determine whether a correlation with surgical difficulty existed. A 1:1 Mahalanobis distance matching was utilized to investigate the effect of tumor location on L-RPS outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The patients were stratified into 3 levels of difficulty (31 intermediate, 143 advanced, and 422 expert) based on the IS. When using a stepwise increase of the IS excluding the tumor location score, only Pringle's maneuver was more frequently used in the higher surgical difficulty level (35.5%, 54.6%, and 65.2%, intermediate, advanced, and expert levels, respectively, Z = 3.34, p = 0.001). Other perioperative results were not associated with a statistical gradation toward higher difficulty level. 80 of 85 patients with a segment VI lesion and 511 patients with a segment VII lesion were matched 1:1. There were no significant differences in the perioperative outcomes of the two groups including open conversion, operating time, blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion, postoperative stay, major morbidity, and mortality.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Among patients undergoing L-RPS, the IS did not significantly correlate with most outcome measures associated with intraoperative difficulty and postoperative outcomes. Similarly, tumor location had no effect on L-RPS outcomes.",5
10,"High-Grade Glioma Treatment Response Monitoring Biomarkers: A Position Statement on the Evidence Supporting the Use of Advanced MRI Techniques in the Clinic, and the Latest Bench-to-Bedside Developments. Part 2: Spectroscopy, Chemical Exchange Saturation, Multiparametric Imaging, and Radiomics","Objective:
        
      
      To summarize evidence for use of advanced MRI techniques as monitoring biomarkers in the clinic, and to highlight the latest bench-to-bedside developments.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The current evidence regarding the potential for monitoring biomarkers was reviewed and individual modalities of metabolism and/or chemical composition imaging discussed. Perfusion, permeability, and microstructure imaging were similarly analyzed in Part 1 of this two-part review article and are valuable reading as background to this article. We appraise the clinic readiness of all the individual modalities and consider methodologies involving machine learning (radiomics) and the combination of MRI approaches (multiparametric imaging).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The biochemical composition of high-grade gliomas is markedly different from healthy brain tissue. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the simultaneous acquisition of an array of metabolic alterations, with choline-based ratios appearing to be consistently discriminatory in treatment response assessment, although challenges remain despite this being a mature technique. Promising directions relate to ultra-high field strengths, 2-hydroxyglutarate analysis, and the use of non-proton nuclei. Labile protons on endogenous proteins can be selectively targeted with chemical exchange saturation transfer to give high resolution images. The body of evidence for clinical application of amide proton transfer imaging has been building for a decade, but more evidence is required to confirm chemical exchange saturation transfer use as a monitoring biomarker. Multiparametric methodologies, including the incorporation of nuclear medicine techniques, combine probes measuring different tumor properties. Although potentially synergistic, the limitations of each individual modality also can be compounded, particularly in the absence of standardization. Machine learning requires large datasets with high-quality annotation; there is currently low-level evidence for monitoring biomarker clinical application.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Advanced MRI techniques show huge promise in treatment response assessment. The clinical readiness analysis highlights that most monitoring biomarkers require standardized international consensus guidelines, with more facilitation regarding technique implementation and reporting in the clinic.",3
11,Expected value of artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal endoscopy: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Position Statement,"This ESGE Position Statement defines the expected value of artificial intelligence (AI) for the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal neoplasia within the framework of the performance measures already defined by ESGE. This is based on the clinical relevance of the expected task and the preliminary evidence regarding artificial intelligence in artificial or clinical settings. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS:: (1) For acceptance of AI in assessment of completeness of upper GI endoscopy, the adequate level of mucosal inspection with AI should be comparable to that assessed by experienced endoscopists. (2) For acceptance of AI in assessment of completeness of upper GI endoscopy, automated recognition and photodocumentation of relevant anatomical landmarks should be obtained in ≥90% of the procedures. (3) For acceptance of AI in the detection of Barrett's high grade intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer, the AI-assisted detection rate for suspicious lesions for targeted biopsies should be comparable to that of experienced endoscopists with or without advanced imaging techniques. (4) For acceptance of AI in the management of Barrett's neoplasia, AI-assisted selection of lesions amenable to endoscopic resection should be comparable to that of experienced endoscopists. (5) For acceptance of AI in the diagnosis of gastric precancerous conditions, AI-assisted diagnosis of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia should be comparable to that provided by the established biopsy protocol, including the estimation of extent, and consequent allocation to the correct endoscopic surveillance interval. (6) For acceptance of artificial intelligence for automated lesion detection in small-bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE), the performance of AI-assisted reading should be comparable to that of experienced endoscopists for lesion detection, without increasing but possibly reducing the reading time of the operator. (7) For acceptance of AI in the detection of colorectal polyps, the AI-assisted adenoma detection rate should be comparable to that of experienced endoscopists. (8) For acceptance of AI optical diagnosis (computer-aided diagnosis [CADx]) of diminutive polyps (≤5 mm), AI-assisted characterization should match performance standards for implementing resect-and-discard and diagnose-and-leave strategies. (9) For acceptance of AI in the management of polyps ≥ 6 mm, AI-assisted characterization should be comparable to that of experienced endoscopists in selecting lesions amenable to endoscopic resection.",0
12,GliMR: Cross-Border Collaborations to Promote Advanced MRI Biomarkers for Glioma,"Purpose:
        
      
      There is an annual incidence of 50,000 glioma cases in Europe. The optimal treatment strategy is highly personalised, depending on tumour type, grade, spatial localization, and the degree of tissue infiltration. In research settings, advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown great promise as a tool to inform personalised treatment decisions. However, the use of advanced MRI in clinical practice remains scarce due to the downstream effects of siloed glioma imaging research with limited representation of MRI specialists in established consortia; and the associated lack of available tools and expertise in clinical settings. These shortcomings delay the translation of scientific breakthroughs into novel treatment strategy. As a response we have developed the network ""Glioma MR Imaging 2.0"" (GliMR) which we present in this article.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      GliMR aims to build a pan-European and multidisciplinary network of experts and accelerate the use of advanced MRI in glioma beyond the current ""state-of-the-art"" in glioma imaging. The Action Glioma MR Imaging 2.0 (GliMR) was granted funding by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) in June 2019.
    


          Results:
        
      
      GliMR's first grant period ran from September 2019 to April 2020, during which several meetings were held and projects were initiated, such as reviewing the current knowledge on advanced MRI; developing a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant consent form; and setting up the website.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The Action overcomes the pre-existing limitations of glioma research and is funded until September 2023. New members will be accepted during its entire duration.",0
13,Noncontrast Computed Tomography vs Computed Tomography Perfusion or Magnetic Resonance Imaging Selection in Late Presentation of Stroke With Large-Vessel Occlusion,"Importance:
        
      
      Advanced imaging for patient selection in mechanical thrombectomy is not widely available.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the clinical outcomes of patients selected for mechanical thrombectomy by noncontrast computed tomography (CT) vs those selected by computed tomography perfusion (CTP) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the extended time window.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This multinational cohort study included consecutive patients with proximal anterior circulation occlusion stroke presenting within 6 to 24 hours of time last seen well from January 2014 to December 2020. This study was conducted at 15 sites across 5 countries in Europe and North America. The duration of follow-up was 90 days from stroke onset.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Computed tomography with Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, CTP, or MRI.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary end point was the distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days (ordinal shift). Secondary outcomes included the rates of 90-day functional independence (mRS scores of 0-2), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 2304 patients screened for eligibility, 1604 patients were included, with a median (IQR) age of 70 (59-80) years; 848 (52.9%) were women. A total of 534 patients were selected to undergo mechanical thrombectomy by CT, 752 by CTP, and 318 by MRI. After adjustment of confounders, there was no difference in 90-day ordinal mRS shift between patients selected by CT vs CTP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.95 [95% CI, 0.77-1.17]; P = .64) or CT vs MRI (aOR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.8-1.13]; P = .55). The rates of 90-day functional independence (mRS scores 0-2 vs 3-6) were similar between patients selected by CT vs CTP (aOR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.7-1.16]; P = .42) but lower in patients selected by MRI than CT (aOR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.98]; P = .03). Successful reperfusion was more common in the CT and CTP groups compared with the MRI group (474 [88.9%] and 670 [89.5%] vs 250 [78.9%]; P < .001). No significant differences in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (CT, 42 [8.1%]; CTP, 43 [5.8%]; MRI, 15 [4.7%]; P = .11) or 90-day mortality (CT, 125 [23.4%]; CTP, 159 [21.1%]; MRI, 62 [19.5%]; P = .38) were observed.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In patients undergoing proximal anterior circulation mechanical thrombectomy in the extended time window, there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes of patients selected with noncontrast CT compared with those selected with CTP or MRI. These findings have the potential to widen the indication for treating patients in the extended window using a simpler and more widespread noncontrast CT-only paradigm.",2
14,WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-E/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections,"Skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions that involve the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle, ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.Together, the World Society of Emergency Surgery, the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery, the Surgical Infection Society-Europe, The World Surgical Infection Society, and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma have jointly completed an international multi-society document to promote global standards of care in SSTIs guiding clinicians by describing reasonable approaches to the management of SSTIs.An extensive non-systematic review was conducted using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases, limited to the English language. The resulting evidence was shared by an international task force with different clinical backgrounds.",3
15,Blood loss and transfusion risk in robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty: A retrospective analysis,"Background:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to compare total blood loss and the risk of receiving a blood transfusion in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) against conventional jig-based techniques.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Robotic TKA (n = 50) and UKA (n = 50) patients were matched to contemporary controls for TKA (n = 50) and UKA (n = 50) and retrospectively analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Robotic TKA patients experienced 23.7% less blood loss compared to conventional TKA patients (911.0 ml vs 1193.7 ml, p < 0.01), and were associated with an 83% relative risk reduction of receiving a transfusion (2% of patients vs 12%, p = 0.02). Robotic UKA patients did not demonstrate less blood loss compared to corresponding controls (821.7 ml vs 854.7 ml, p = 0.69). Both UKA groups received no transfusions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic surgical systems in TKA reduces blood loss and lowers the risk of requiring a blood transfusion. In UKA, robotic-assisted arthroplasty did not reduce blood loss compared to conventional arthroplasty.",8
16,The visual geometry of a tool modulates generalization during adaptation,"Knowledge about a tool's dynamics can be acquired from the visual configuration of the tool and through physical interaction. Here, we examine how visual information affects the generalization of dynamic learning during tool use. Subjects rotated a virtual hammer-like object while we varied the object dynamics separately for two rotational directions. This allowed us to quantify the coupling of adaptation between the directions, that is, how adaptation transferred from one direction to the other. Two groups experienced the same dynamics of the object. For one group, the object's visual configuration was displayed, while for the other, the visual display was uninformative as to the dynamics. We fit a range of context-dependent state-space models to the data, comparing different forms of coupling. We found that when the object's visual configuration was explicitly provided, there was substantial coupling, such that 31% of learning in one direction transferred to the other. In contrast, when the visual configuration was ambiguous, despite experiencing the same dynamics, the coupling was reduced to 12%. Our results suggest that generalization of dynamic learning of a tool relies, not only on its dynamic behaviour, but also on the visual configuration with which the dynamics is associated.",6
17,Telesurgery prospects in delivering healthcare in remote areas,"Feasibility and safety of performing remote surgery was first established by performing surgeries on pigs in later part of the 20th century. The first tele-robotic remote surgical system was set up in Canada in 2003 between two hospitals 400 kilometres away. The current review was planned to have a look at the current state of robotic surgery and its use in telesurgery. Literature search was conducted for articles related to ""Robotic Surgery"" and ""Tele-Surgery"". Our search included articles published in English literature, including case studies and review articles. We searched Google Scholar and PubMed to search relevant articles. Introduction of haptic feedback technology added significantly to safety robotic surgery. Tele-surgery, also called tele-robotics, combines the advantages of robotic surgery, including magnified view, augmented reality and improved ergonomics and dexterity, and provision of surgical care in remote areas and difficult-to-reach locations like spacecrafts and ships. Challenges, like cost, availability and legislations, remain to be addressed.",1
18,"Intracorporeal Versus Extracorporeal Anastomosis in Robotic Right Colectomy: A Multicenter, Triple-blind, Randomized Clinical Trial","Objective:
        
      
      To determine if minimally invasive right colectomy with intra-corporeal anastomosis improves postoperative recovery compared to extra-corporeal anastomosis.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Previous trials have shown that intracorporeal anastomosis improves postoperative recovery; however, it has not yet been evaluated in a setting with optimized perioperative care or with patient-related outcome measures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a multicenter, triple-blind, randomized clinical trial at two high-volume colorectal centers with strict adherence to optimized perioperative care pathways. The patients underwent robotic right colectomy with either intracorporeal or extracorporeal anastomosis. The primary outcome was patient-reported postoperative recovery measured using the ""Quality of Recovery-15"" questionnaire. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03130166.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 89 patients were randomized and analyzed according to the ""Intention-to-treat""-principle. We found no statistically significant differences in patient-reported recovery between the groups. Postoperative pain, nausea, time to ambulation, time to first passage of flatus/stool, length of hospital stay, and pathophysiological tests showed no differences either. The duration of time to create the anastomosis was significantly longer with intracorporeal anastomosis (17 vs 13 min, P = 0.003), while all other intraoperative, postoperative, and pathology variables showed no difference.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There were no significant differences in postoperative recovery between the two groups.",2
19,Is it the End for Urologic Pelvic Laparoscopic Surgery?,"Aim:
        
      
      To scrutinize the rapid development of robotic versus traditional laparoscopic technique in pelvic urologic surgery.
    


          Introduction:
        
      
      In the last few decades, advances in research and development have led to tremendous progress in medical diagnostics and treatment of disease. Minimally invasive surgery has moved from experimental to becoming the dominant form of surgical management across the surgical specialties. Laparoscopy is nowadays used widely in abdominal surgery, from simple diagnostic laparoscopy to complex colorectal and gynecologic cancer procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medscape, Embase) using the key words: ""pelvic laparoscopy, urologic oncology, robotic surgery, minimally invasive access"" was performed for all relevant articles in the English language. Data were extrapolated from the abstracts alone to avoid subjective bias in drawing conclusions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Telemedicine and telesurgery, the diagnostic and operative process is conducted from a distance. The surgeon uses computer-assisted surgery away from the bedside via a robotic system and performs the surgical task at hand. In pelvic urological cancer surgery the use of robotic technique expands to female and reconstructive procedures as well. The leap forward is so massive, that traditional laparoscopic surgery is starting to be considered less, with a growing number of organizations being now more interested in developing a robotic service. Minimally invasive surgical techniques aim to improve surgical outcome in conjunction with delivery of high-quality patient care. Quality studies demonstrating superiority and cost effectiveness are lacking, however.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although tremendous accomplishments took place over a few years, there is still a lot of ground to be covered in standardizing the learning process and evaluating the outcome from the application of new technologies in the field of robotic pelvic surgery.",1
20,Robot or radiation? A qualitative study of the decision support needs of men with localised prostate cancer choosing between robotic prostatectomy and radiotherapy treatment,"Objective:
        
      
      To understand how best to support men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer to decide which treatment option best suits their needs, when robotic prostatectomy and radiotherapy are equally appropriate to offer them.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-five men recently diagnosed with localised prostate cancer completed semi-structured interviews asking about information/decision-making needs before and/or after attending a combined clinic in which they consulted a urologist and a radiation oncologist regarding treatment options. Data was transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most men preferred robotic prostatectomy pre-combined clinic and chose it afterwards. The thematic analysis revealed four themes: 1) trust in clinicians and the information they provide is critical for treatment choice, 2) perceived fit between treatment characteristics and personal circumstances, 3) additional considerations: specific side effects, socio-emotional and financial factors, and 4) need for tailored information delivery. Robotic prostatectomy was mistakenly believed to provide a more definitive cure than radiotherapy, which was seen as having a lesser lifestyle impact.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Treatment choice is largely dependent on clinicians' (mainly urologists') recommendations.
    


          Practice implications:
        
      
      Patients need more balanced information about alternatives to robotic prostatectomy earlier in the treatment decision-making process. Referral to a radiation oncologist or combined clinic shortly after diagnosis is recommended.",0
21,Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery for benign and malignant disease,"Laparoscopic surgery for benign and malignant pancreatic lesions has slowly been gaining acceptance over the past decade and is being introduced in many centres. Some studies suggest that this approach is equivalent to or better than open surgery, but randomized data are needed to assess outcomes. In this Review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in laparoscopic pancreatic surgery by aggregating high-quality published evidence. Various aspects, including the benefits, limitations, oncological efficacy, learning curve and latest innovations, are discussed. The focus is on laparoscopic Whipple procedure and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for both benign and malignant disease, but robot-assisted surgery is also addressed. Surgical and oncological outcomes are discussed as well as quality of life parameters and the cost efficiency of laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. We have also included decision-aid algorithms based on the literature and our own expertise; these algorithms can assist in the decision to perform a laparoscopic or open procedure.",3
22,Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion versus open radical cystectomy (iROC): protocol for a randomised controlled trial with internal feasibility study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Bladder cancer (BC) is a common malignancy and one of the most expensive to manage. Radical cystectomy (RC) with pelvic lymphadenectomy is a gold standard treatment for high-risk BC. Reductions in morbidity and mortality from RC may be achieved through robot-assisted RC (RARC). Prospective comparisons between open RC (ORC) and RARC have been limited by sample size, use of extracorporeal reconstruction and use of outcomes important for ORC. Conversely, while RARC is gaining in popularity, there is little evidence to suggest it is superior to ORC. We are undertaking a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare RARC with intracorporeal reconstruction (iRARC) and ORC using multimodal outcomes to explore qualitative and quantitative recovery after surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: iROC is a multicentre prospective RCT in English National Health Service (NHS) cancer centres. We will randomise 320 patients undergoing RC to either iRARC or ORC. Treatment allocation will occur after trial entry and consent. The primary outcome is days alive and out of hospital within the first 90 days from surgery. Secondary outcomes will measure functional recovery (activity trackers, chair-to-stand tests and health related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires), morbidity (complications and readmissions), cost-effectiveness (using EuroQol-5 Domain-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) and unit costs) and surgeon fatigue. Patients will be analysed according to intention to treat. The primary outcome will be transformed and analysed using regression. All statistical assumptions will be investigated. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using appropriate regression methods. An internal feasibility study of the first 30 patients will evaluate recruitment rates, acceptance of randomised treatment choice, compliance outcome collection and to revise our sample size.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      The study has ethical approval (REC reference 16/NE/0418). Findings will be made available to patients, clinicians, funders and the NHS through peer-reviewed publications, social media and patient support groups.

23,Safety and feasibility of early single-dose mitomycin C bladder instillation after robot-assisted radical nephroureterectomy,"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the safety and feasibility of early single-dose mitomycin C (MMC) bladder instillation after robot-assisted radical nephroureterectomy (RARNU) at a tertiary kidney cancer centre. RARNU with bladder cuff excision and subsequent MMC bladder instillation to reduce recurrence risk is the 'gold standard' for high-risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC). We adapted a RARNU technique with precise distal ureteric dissection, bladder cuff excision and watertight bladder closure.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing RARNU for UUTUC at our centre performed as a standardised transperitoneal procedure comprising of: bladder cuff excision, two-layer watertight closure and intraoperative bladder leak test; without re-docking/re-positioning of the robotic surgical system. Patient demographics, the timing of MMC instillation, adverse events (surgical and potentially MMC-related) and length of stay (LOS) were assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 69 patients underwent a RARNU with instillation of MMC. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 70 (62-78) years. The median (IQR) day of MMC instillation was 2 (1-3) days and the median (IQR) LOS was 2 (2-4) days, with urethral catheter removal on day of discharge in all cases. Only Grade I Clavien-Dindo complications occurred in seven patients (10%); five had ileus, one a wound infection and one a self-limiting delirium, all managed conservatively. No adverse events potentially related to MMC instillation were noted within 30 days postoperatively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The use of intravesical MMC instillation given in the immediate postoperative period appears feasible and safe in patients undergoing RARNU with intraoperative confirmation of a water-tight closure ensuring early catheter-free discharge, with no significant adverse events. The potential reduction in intravesical recurrence in patients receiving early MMC needs to be assessed with longitudinal follow-up studies.",2
24,Determinants of referral of women with urinary incontinence to specialist services: a national cohort study using primary care data from the UK,"Background:
        
      
      Female urinary incontinence is underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care. There is little evidence on factors that determine whether women with urinary incontinence are referred to specialist services. This study aimed to investigate characteristics associated with referrals from primary to specialist secondary care for urinary incontinence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We carried out a cohort study, using primary care data from over 600 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the United Kingdom. We used multi-level logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) that reflect the impact of patient and GP practice-level characteristics on referrals to specialist services in secondary care within 30 days of a urinary incontinence diagnosis. All women aged ≥18 years newly diagnosed with urinary incontinence between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2013 were included. One-year referral was estimated with death as competing event.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 104,466 included women (median age: 58 years), 28,476 (27.3%) were referred within 30 days. Referral rates decreased with age (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.31-0.37, comparing women aged ≥80 with those aged 40-49 years) and was lower among women who were severely obese (aOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.90), smokers (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98), women from a minority-ethnic backgrounds (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.89 comparing Asian with white women), women with pelvic organ prolapse (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87), and women in Scotland (aOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.78, comparing women in Scotland and England). One-year referral rate was 34.0% and the pattern of associations with patient characteristics was almost the same as for 30-day referrals.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      About one in four women with urinary incontinence were referred to specialist secondary care services within one month after a UI diagnosis and one in three within one year. Referral rates decreased with age which confirms concerns that older women with UI are less likely to receive care according to existing clinical guidelines. Referral rates were also lower in women from minority-ethnic backgrounds. These finding may reflect clinicians' beliefs about the appropriateness of referral, differences in women's preferences for treatment, or other factors leading to inequities in referral for urinary incontinence.",5
25,European Association of Urology Guidelines on Male Urinary Incontinence,"Context:
        
      
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common condition in elderly men causing a severe worsening of quality of life, and a significant cost for both patients and health systems.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To report a practical, evidence-based, guideline on definitions, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment options for men with different forms of UI.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A comprehensive literature search, limited to studies representing high levels of evidence and published in the English language, was performed. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. A level of evidence and a grade of recommendation were assigned.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      UI can be classified into stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mixed urinary incontinence. A detailed description of the pathophysiology and diagnostic workup has been reported. Simple clinical interventions, behavioural and physical modifications, and pharmacological treatments comprise the initial management for all kinds of UI. Surgery for SUI includes bulking agents, male sling, and compression devices. Surgery for UUI includes bladder wall injection of botulinum toxin A, sacral nerve stimulation, and cystoplasty/urinary diversion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This 2022 European Association of Urology guideline summary provides updated information on definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of male UI.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Male urinary incontinence comprises a broad subject area, much of which has been covered for the first time in the literature in a single manuscript. The European Association of Urology Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Guideline Panel has released this new guidance, with the aim to provide updated information for urologists to be able to follow diagnostic and therapeutic indications for optimising patient care.",3
26,Andrological effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose:
        
      
      The short- and long-term andrological effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been clarified. Our aim is to evaluate the available evidence regarding possible andrological consequences of COVID-19 either on seminal or hormonal parameters. The safety of the COVID-19 vaccines in terms of sperm quality was also investigated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All prospective and retrospective observational studies reporting information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) mRNA semen and male genitalia tract detection (n = 19), as well as those reporting data on semen analysis (n = 5) and hormonal parameters (n = 11) in infected/recovered patients without any arbitrary restriction were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Out of 204 retrieved articles, 35 were considered, including 2092 patients and 1138 controls with a mean age of 44.1 ± 12.6 years, and mean follow-up 24.3 ± 18.9 days. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA can be localized in male genitalia tracts during the acute phase of the disease. COVID-19 can result in short-term impaired sperm and T production. Available data cannot clarify long-term andrological effects. Low T observed in the acute phase of the disease is associated with an increased risk of being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit or death. The two available studies showed that the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines does not affect sperm quality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results of our analysis clearly suggest that each patient recovering from COVID-19 should be monitored to rule out sperm and T abnormalities. The specific contribution of reduced T levels during the acute phase of the infection needs to be better clarified.",0
27,Comparing alternating pressure mattresses and high-specification foam mattresses to prevent pressure ulcers in high-risk patients: the PRESSURE 2 RCT,"Background:
        
      
      Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a burden to patients, carers and health-care providers. Specialist mattresses minimise the intensity and duration of pressure on vulnerable skin sites in at-risk patients.
    


          Primary objective:
        
      
      Time to developing a new PU of category ≥ 2 in patients using an alternating pressure mattress (APM) compared with a high-specification foam mattress (HSFM).
    


          Design:
        
      
      A multicentre, Phase III, open, prospective, planned as an adaptive double-triangular group sequential, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with an a priori sample size of 2954 participants. Randomisation used minimisation (incorporating a random element).
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The trial was set in 42 secondary and community inpatient facilities in the UK.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Adult inpatients with evidence of acute illness and at a high risk of PU development.
    


          Interventions and follow-up:
        
      
      APM or HSFM - the treatment phase lasted a maximum of 60 days; the final 30 days were post-treatment follow-up.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Time to event.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From August 2013 to November 2016, 2029 participants were randomised to receive either APM (n = 1016) or HSFM (n = 1013). Primary end point - 30-day final follow-up: of the 2029 participants in the intention-to-treat population, 160 (7.9%) developed a new PU of category ≥ 2. There was insufficient evidence of a difference between groups for time to new PU of category ≥ 2 [Fine and Gray model HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.04; exact p-value of 0.0890 and 2% absolute difference]. Treatment phase sensitivity analysis: 132 (6.5%) participants developed a new PU of category ≥ 2 between randomisation and end of treatment phase. There was a statistically significant difference in the treatment phase time-to-event sensitivity analysis (Fine and Gray model HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.0176 and 2.6% absolute difference). Secondary end points - 30-day final follow-up: new PUs of category ≥ 1 developed in 350 (17.2%) participants, with no evidence of a difference between mattress groups in time to PU development, (Fine and Gray model HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; p-value = 0.0733 and absolute difference 3.1%). New PUs of category ≥ 3 developed in 32 (1.6%) participants with insufficient evidence of a difference between mattress groups in time to PU development (Fine and Gray model HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.62; p = 0.5530 and absolute difference 0.4%). Of the 145 pre-existing PUs of category 2, 89 (61.4%) healed - there was insufficient evidence of a difference in time to healing (Fine and Gray model HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68; p = 0.6122 and absolute difference 2.9%). Health economics - the within-trial and long-term analysis showed APM to be cost-effective compared with HSFM; however, the difference in costs models are small and the quality-adjusted life-year gains are very small. There were no safety concerns. Blinded photography substudy - the reliability of central blinded review compared with clinical assessment for PUs of category ≥ 2 was 'very good' (kappa statistic 0.82, prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa 0.82). Quality-of-life substudy - the Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life - Prevention (PU-QoL-P) instrument meets the established criteria for reliability, construct validity and responsiveness.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      A lower than anticipated event rate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In acutely ill inpatients who are bedfast/chairfast and/or have a category 1 PU and/or localised skin pain, APMs confer a small treatment phase benefit that is diminished over time. Overall, the APM patient compliance, very low PU incidence rate observed and small differences between mattresses indicate the need for improved indicators for targeting of APMs and individualised decision-making. Decisions should take into account skin status, patient preferences (movement ability and rehabilitation needs) and the presence of factors that may be potentially modifiable through APM allocation, including being completely immobile, having nutritional deficits, lacking capacity and/or having altered skin/category 1 PU.
    


          Future work:
        
      
      Explore the relationship between mental capacity, levels of independent movement, repositioning and PU development. Explore 'what works for whom and in what circumstances'.

28,The role of damage control surgery in the treatment of perforated colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction:
        
      
      Damage control surgery (DCS) is the classic approach to manage severe trauma and has recently also been considered an appropriate approach to the treatment of critically ill patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis. The purpose of the present review is to evaluate the outcomes following DCS for Hinchey II-IV complicated acute diverticulitis (CAD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive systematic search was undertaken to identify all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies, irrespectively of their size, publication status, and language. Adults who have undergone DCS for CAD Hinchey II, III, or IV were included in this review. DCS is compared with the immediate and definitive surgical treatment in the form of HP, colonic resection, and primary anastomosis (RPA) with or without covering stoma or laparoscopic lavage. We searched the following electronic databases: PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge. The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was published on Prospero (CRD42020144953).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine studies with 318 patients, undergoing DCS, were included. The presence of septic shock at the presentation in the emergency department was heterogeneous, and the weighted mean rate of septic shock across the studies was shown to be 35.1% [95% CI 8.4 to 78.6%]. The majority of the patients had Hinchey III (68.3%) disease. The remainder had either Hinchey IV (28.9%) or Hinchey II (2.8%). Phase I is similarly described in most of the studies as lavage, limited resection with closed blind colonic ends. In a few studies, resection and anastomosis (9.1%) or suture of the perforation site (0.9%) were performed in phase I of DCS. In those patients who underwent DCS, the most common method of temporary abdominal closure (TAC) was the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) (97.8%). The RPA was performed in 62.1% [95% CI 40.8 to 83.3%] and the 22.7% [95% CI 15.1 to 30.3%]: 12.8% during phase I and 87.2% during phase III. A covering ileostomy was performed in 6.9% [95% CI 1.5 to 12.2%]. In patients with RPA, the overall leak was 7.3% [95% CI 4.3 to 10.4%] and the major anastomotic leaks were 4.7% [95% CI 2.0 to 7.4%]; the rate of postoperative mortality was estimated to be 9.2% [95% CI 6.0 to 12.4%].
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present meta-analysis revealed an approximately 62.1% weighted rate of achieving GI continuity with the DCS approach to generalized peritonitis in Hinchey III and IV with major leaks of 4.7% and overall mortality of 9.2%. Despite the promising results, we are aware of the limitations related to the significant heterogeneity of inclusion criteria. Importantly, the low rate of reported septic shock may point toward selection bias. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical advantages and cost-effectiveness of the DCS approach.",3
29,The WSES/SICG/ACOI/SICUT/AcEMC/SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly,"Acute left colonic diverticulitis (ALCD) in the elderly presents with unique epidemiological features when compared with younger patients. The clinical presentation is more nuanced in the elderly population, having higher in-hospital and postoperative mortality. Furthermore, geriatric comorbidities are a risk factor for complicated diverticulitis. Finally, elderly patients have a lower risk of recurrent episodes and, in case of recurrence, a lower probability of requiring urgent surgery than younger patients. The aim of the present work is to study age-related factors that may support a unique approach to the diagnosis and treatment of this problem in the elderly when compared with the WSES guidelines for the management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis. During the 1° Pisa Workshop of Acute Care & Trauma Surgery held in Pisa (Italy) in September 2019, with the collaboration of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), the Italian Society of Geriatric Surgery (SICG), the Italian Hospital Surgeons Association (ACOI), the Italian Emergency Surgery and Trauma Association (SICUT), the Academy of Emergency Medicine and Care (AcEMC) and the Italian Society of Surgical Pathophysiology (SIFIPAC), three panel members presented a number of statements developed for each of the four themes regarding the diagnosis and management of ALCD in older patients, formulated according to the GRADE approach, at a Consensus Conference where a panel of experts participated. The statements were subsequently debated, revised, and finally approved by the Consensus Conference attendees. The current paper is a summary report of the definitive guidelines statements on each of the following topics: diagnosis, management, surgical technique and antibiotic therapy.",3
30,"Wheelchair service provision education for healthcare professional students, healthcare personnel and educators across low- to high-resourced settings: a scoping review","Purpose:
        
      
      This review aimed to collate and summarize available research literature about wheelchair service provision education available to healthcare professional students, healthcare personnel and educators across low- to high-resourced settings.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Joanna Briggs Institute methodological steps for scoping reviews were followed. Included studies were mainly sourced from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Academic Search Complete and ProQuest. Independent title, abstract and full-text screening with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria was performed. All screening and extraction were performed independently by two authors. A thematic approach was used to synthesize results. Data extracted from included studies were charted according to a template that we created. The study quality was also appraised.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 25 articles were included (11, 36% from high-income settings) with 12 (48%) observational studies and 13 (52%) experimental studies. The literature addressed three main topics: (1) assessing wheelchair service provision knowledge, (2) implementing training interventions using in-person, online and/or hybrid learning approaches and (3) describing current wheelchair service provision education globally. The most frequently reported training programs used were the Wheelchair Skills Program and the World Health Organization Wheelchair Service Training Package - Basic Level.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Limited information has been published about the integration of wheelchair content into the curricula of professional rehabilitation programs. Efforts to build international partnerships, improve the quality and currency of training programs and build resources that can assist educators in the integration of wheelchair-related content into professional rehabilitation programs should be prioritized.Implications for RehabilitationThis is the first review that examined and synthesized the current state of wheelchair service provision education for rehabilitation students and personnel across low- to high-income countries.Findings from this review indicate that there is limited information about the integration of wheelchair-related content into professional rehabilitation programs.Efforts to build international partnerships, standardize wheelchair service provision content and evaluation and integrate training into professional rehabilitation programs worldwide should be prioritized.",3
31,COVID-19 pathways for brain and heart injury in comorbidity patients: A role of medical imaging and artificial intelligence-based COVID severity classification: A review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated the field of medicine, particularly the field of radiology. Since its emergence, the highly virulent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 10 million people, leading to over 500,000 deaths as of July 1st, 2020. Since the outbreak began, almost 28,000 articles about COVID-19 have been published (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); however, few have explored the role of imaging and artificial intelligence in COVID-19 patients-specifically, those with comorbidities. This paper begins by presenting the four pathways that can lead to heart and brain injuries following a COVID-19 infection. Our survey also offers insights into the role that imaging can play in the treatment of comorbid patients, based on probabilities derived from COVID-19 symptom statistics. Such symptoms include myocardial injury, hypoxia, plaque rupture, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, coronary thrombosis, encephalitis, ischemia, inflammation, and lung injury. At its core, this study considers the role of image-based AI, which can be used to characterize the tissues of a COVID-19 patient and classify the severity of their infection. Image-based AI is more important than ever as the pandemic surges and countries worldwide grapple with limited medical resources for detection and diagnosis.",0
32,"Contribution of copy number variants to schizophrenia from a genome-wide study of 41,321 subjects","Copy number variants (CNVs) have been strongly implicated in the genetic etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ). However, genome-wide investigation of the contribution of CNV to risk has been hampered by limited sample sizes. We sought to address this obstacle by applying a centralized analysis pipeline to a SCZ cohort of 21,094 cases and 20,227 controls. A global enrichment of CNV burden was observed in cases (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, P = 5.7 × 10-15), which persisted after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR = 1.07, P = 1.7 × 10-6). CNV burden was enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR = 1.68, P = 2.8 × 10-11) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR = 1.18, P = 7.3 × 10-5). Genome-wide significant evidence was obtained for eight loci, including 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 3q29, 7q11.2, 15q13.3, distal 16p11.2, proximal 16p11.2 and 22q11.2. Suggestive support was found for eight additional candidate susceptibility and protective loci, which consisted predominantly of CNVs mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination.",1
33,Patient Selection in One Anastomosis/Mini Gastric Bypass-an Expert Modified Delphi Consensus,"Purpose:
        
      
      One anastomosis/mini gastric bypass (OAGB/MGB) is up to date the third most performed obesity and metabolic procedure worldwide, which recently has been endorsed by ASMBS. The main criticisms are the risk of bile reflux, esophageal cancer, and malnutrition. Although IFSO has recognized this procedure, guidance is needed regarding selection criteria. To give clinicians a daily support in performing the right patient selection in OAGB/MGB, the aim of this paper is to generate clinical guidelines based on an expert modified Delphi consensus.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A committee of 57 recognized bariatric surgeons from 24 countries created 69 statements. Modified Delphi consensus voting was performed in two rounds. An agreement/disagreement among ≥ 70.0% of the experts was considered to indicate a consensus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Consensus was achieved for 56 statements. Remarkably, ≥ 90.0% of the experts felt that OAGB/MGB is an acceptable and suitable option ""in patients with Body mass index (BMI) > 70, BMI > 60, BMI > 50 kg/m2 as a one-stage procedure,"" ""as the second stage of a two-stage bariatric surgery after Sleeve Gastrectomy for BMI > 50 kg/m2 (instead of BPD/DS),"" and ""in patients with weight regain after restrictive procedures. No consensus was reached on the statement that OAGB/MGB is a suitable option in case of resistant Helicobacter pylori. This is likely as there is a concern that this procedure is associated with reflux and its related long-term complications including risk of cancer in the esophagus or stomach. Also no consensus reached on OAGB/MGB as conversional surgery in patients with GERD after restrictive procedures. Consensus for disagreement was predominantly achieved ""in case of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach"" (74.55%), ""in patients with severe Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)(C,D)"" (75.44%), ""in patients with Barrett's metaplasia"" (89.29%), and ""in documented insulinoma"" (89.47%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patient selection in OAGB/MGB is still a point of discussion among experts. There was consensus that OAGB/MGB is a suitable option in elderly patients, patients with low BMI (30-35 kg/m2) with associated metabolic problems, and patients with BMIs more than 50 kg/m2 as one-stage procedure. OAGB/MGB can also be a safe procedure in vegetarian and vegan patients. Although OAGB/MGB can be a suitable procedure in patients with large hiatal hernia with concurrent hiatal hernia, it should not be offered to patients with grade C or D esophagitis or Barrett's metaplasia.",3
34,The current practice of cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for colorectal peritoneal metastases: Results of a worldwide web-based survey of the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI),"Background:
        
      
      At present, selected patients with resectable colorectal peritoneal metastases (CRC-PM) are increasingly treated with a combination therapy of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The aim of this study was to investigate the current worldwide practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      HIPEC experts from 19 countries were invited through the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI) to complete an online survey concerning their personal expertise and current hospital and countrywide practice.
    


          Results:
        
      
      It is estimated that currently more than 3800 patients with CRC-PM (synchronous and metachronous) are annually treated with CRS and HIPEC in 430 centers. Integration of CRS and HIPEC in national guidelines varies, resulting in large treatment disparities between countries. Amongst the experts, there was general agreement on issues related to indication, surgical technique and follow up but less on systemic chemotherapy or proactive strategies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This international survey demonstrates that CRS and HIPEC is now performed on a large scale for CRC-PM patients. Variation in treatment may result in heterogeneity in surgical and oncological outcomes, emphasising the necessity to reach consensus on several issues of this comprehensive procedure. Future initiatives directed at achieving an international consensus statement are needed.",3
35,"A prospective non-randomized controlled, multicenter trial comparing Appendectomy and Conservative Treatment for Patients with Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis (the ACTUAA study)","Purpose:
        
      
      Acute appendicitis (AA) is among the most common causes of lower abdominal pain and admissions to the emergency department. Over the past 20 years, there has been a renewed interest in the conservative management of uncomplicated AA, and several studies demonstrated that an antibiotic-first strategy is a viable treatment option for uncomplicated AA. The aim of this prospective non-randomized controlled, multicenter trial is to compare antibiotic therapy and emergency appendectomy as treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA confirmed by US and/or CT or MRI scan.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All adult patients in the age range 18 to 65 years with suspected AA, consecutively admitted to the Surgical Department of the 13 participating Italian Hospitals, will be invited to take part in the study. A multicenter prospective collected registry developed by surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis represents the best research method to assess the long-term role of antibiotics in the management of the disease. Comparison will be made between surgical and antibiotic-first approaches to uncomplicated AA through the analysis of the primary outcome measure of complication-free treatment success rate based on 1-year follow-up. Quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain evaluation, and time to return to normal activity will be evaluated as secondary outcome measures.

36,Complementary roles of surgery and systemic treatment in clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Standard-of-care management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) indisputably relies on surgery for low-risk localized tumours and systemic treatment for poor-prognosis metastatic disease, but a grey area remains, encompassing high-risk localized tumours and patients with metastatic disease with a good-to-intermediate prognosis. Over the past few years, results of major practice-changing trials for the management of metastatic RCC have completely transformed the therapeutic options for this disease. Treatments targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been the mainstay of therapy for metastatic RCC in the past decade, but the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape in the metastatic setting. Results from several pivotal trials have shown a substantial benefit from the combination of VEGF-directed therapy and immune checkpoint inhibition, raising new hopes for the treatment of high-risk localized RCC. The potential of these therapeutics to facilitate the surgical extirpation of the tumour in the neoadjuvant setting or to improve disease-free survival in the adjuvant setting has been investigated. The role of surgery for metastatic RCC has been redefined, with results of large trials bringing into question the paradigm of upfront cytoreductive nephrectomy, inherited from the era of cytokine therapy, when initial extirpation of the primary tumour did show clinical benefits. The potential benefits and risks of deferred surgery for residual primary tumours or metastases after partial response to checkpoint inhibitor treatment are also gaining interest, considering the long-lasting effects of these new drugs, which encourages the complete removal of residual masses.",0
37,Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer: Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2019,"Background:
        
      
      Innovations in treatments, imaging, and molecular characterisation in advanced prostate cancer have improved outcomes, but there are still many aspects of management that lack high-level evidence to inform clinical practice. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2019 addressed some of these topics to supplement guidelines that are based on level 1 evidence.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To present the results from the APCCC 2019.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Similar to prior conferences, experts identified 10 important areas of controversy regarding the management of advanced prostate cancer: locally advanced disease, biochemical recurrence after local therapy, treating the primary tumour in the metastatic setting, metastatic hormone-sensitive/naïve prostate cancer, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, bone health and bone metastases, molecular characterisation of tissue and blood, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, and adverse effects of hormonal therapy and their management. A panel of 72 international prostate cancer experts developed the programme and the consensus questions.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 123 predefined questions, which were developed by both voting and nonvoting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Panellists voted based on their opinions rather than a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions had varying degrees of support by the panel, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results reported in the Supplementary material.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These voting results from a panel of prostate cancer experts can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of advanced prostate management for which high-level evidence is sparse. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient-specific factors, such as disease extent and location, prior lines of therapy, comorbidities, and treatment preferences, together with current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic constraints. Clinical trial enrolment for men with advanced prostate cancer should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2019 once again identified important questions that merit assessment in specifically designed trials.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference, which has been held three times since 2015, aims to share the knowledge of world experts in prostate cancer management with health care providers worldwide. At the end of the conference, an expert panel discusses and votes on predefined consensus questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision making.",0
38,Adjuvant nivolumab versus ipilimumab (CheckMate 238 trial): Reassessment of 4-year efficacy outcomes in patients with stage III melanoma per AJCC-8 staging criteria,"Purpose:
        
      
      Nivolumab was approved as adjuvant therapy for melanoma based on data from CheckMate 238, which enrolled patients per American Joint Committee on Cancer version 7 (AJCC-7) criteria. Here, we analyse long-term outcomes per AJCC-8 staging criteria compared with AJCC-7 results to inform clinical decisions for patients diagnosed per AJCC-8.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      In a double-blind, phase 3 trial (NCT02388906), patients aged ≥15 years with resected, histologically confirmed AJCC-7 stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma were randomised to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then every 12 weeks, both intravenously ≤1 year. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were assessed in patients with stage III disease, per AJCC-7 and AJCC-8.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Per AJCC-7 staging, 42.4% and 57.3% of patients were in substage IIIB and IIIC, respectively; per AJCC-8, 1.1%, 30.4%, 62.8%, and 5.0% were in IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IIID. After 4 years' minimum follow-up, the AJCC-7 superior efficacy of nivolumab over ipilimumab in patients with resected stage III melanoma was preserved per AJCC-8 analysis. No statistically significant difference in RFS between stage III substage hazard ratios was observed per AJCC-7 or -8 staging criteria (interaction test: AJCC-7, P = 0.8115; AJCC-8, P = 0.1051; P = 0.8392 ((AJCC-7) and P = 0.8678 (AJCC-8) for DMFS).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CheckMate 238 4-year RFS and DMFS outcomes are consistent per AJCC-7 and AJCC-8 staging criteria. Outcome benefits can therefore be translated for patients diagnosed per AJCC-8.",2
39,Factors associated with and impact of open conversion on the outcomes of minimally invasive left lateral sectionectomies: An international multicenter study,"Background:
        
      
      Despite the rapid advances that minimally invasive liver resection has gained in recent decades, open conversion is still inevitable in some circumstances. In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors for open conversion after minimally invasive left lateral sectionectomy, and its impact on perioperative outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a post hoc analysis of 2,445 of 2,678 patients who underwent minimally invasive left lateral sectionectomy at 45 international centers between 2004 and 2020. Factors related to open conversion were analyzed via univariate and multivariate analyses. One-to-one propensity score matching was used to analyze outcomes after open conversion versus non-converted cases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The open conversion rate was 69/2,445 (2.8%). On multivariate analyses, male gender (3.6% vs 1.8%, P = .011), presence of clinically significant portal hypertension (6.1% vs 2.6%, P = .009), and larger tumor size (50 mm vs 32 mm, P < .001) were identified as independent factors associated with open conversion. The most common reason for conversion was bleeding in 27/69 (39.1%) of cases. After propensity score matching (65 open conversion vs 65 completed via minimally invasive liver resection), the open conversion group was associated with increased operation time, blood transfusion rate, blood loss, and postoperative stay compared with cases completed via the minimally invasive approach.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Male sex, portal hypertension, and larger tumor size were predictive factors of open conversion after minimally invasive left lateral sectionectomy. Open conversion was associated with inferior perioperative outcomes compared with non-converted cases.",9
40,Data standards for atrial fibrillation/flutter and catheter ablation: The European Unified Registries for Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials (EuroHeart),"Aims:
        
      
      Standardized data definitions are essential for monitoring and assessment of care and outcomes in observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The European Unified Registries for Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials (EuroHeart) project of the European Society of Cardiology aimed to develop contemporary data standards for atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) and catheter ablation.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      We used the EuroHeart methodology for development of data standards and formed a Working Group comprising 23 experts in AF/AFL and catheter ablation registries, as well as representatives from the European Heart Rhythm Association and EuroHeart. We conducted a systematic literature review of AF/AFL and catheter ablation registries and data standard documents to generate candidate variables. We used a modified Delphi method to reach consensus on a final variable set. For each variable, the Working Group developed permissible values and definitions, and agreed as to whether the variable was mandatory (Level 1) or additional (Level 2). In total, 70 Level 1 and 92 Level 2 variables were selected and reviewed by a wider Reference Group of 42 experts from 24 countries. The Level 1 variables were implemented into the EuroHeart IT platform as the basis for continuous registration of individual patient data.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      By means of a structured process and working with international stakeholders, harmonized data standards for AF/AFL and catheter ablation for AF/AFL were developed. In context of the EuroHeart project, this will facilitate country-level quality of care improvement, international observational research, registry-based RCTs and post-marketing surveillance of devices and pharmacotherapies.",0
41,Fit-for-Discharge Criteria after Esophagectomy: An International Expert Delphi Consensus,"There are no internationally recognized criteria available to determine preparedness for hospital discharge after esophagectomy. This study aims to achieve international consensus using Delphi methodology. The expert panel consisted of 40 esophageal surgeons spanning 16 countries and 4 continents. During a 3-round, web-based Delphi process, experts voted for discharge criteria using 5-point Likert scales. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Consensus was reached if agreement was ≥75% in round 3. Consensus was achieved for the following basic criteria: nutritional requirements are met by oral intake of at least liquids with optional supplementary nutrition via jejunal feeding tube. The patient should have passed flatus and does not require oxygen during mobilization or at rest. Central venous catheters should be removed. Adequate analgesia at rest and during mobilization is achieved using both oral opioid and non-opioid analgesics. All vital signs should be normal unless abnormal preoperatively. Inflammatory parameters should be trending down and close to normal (leucocyte count ≤12G/l and C-reactive protein ≤80 mg/dl). This multinational Delphi survey represents the first expert-led process for consensus criteria to determine 'fit-for-discharge' status after esophagectomy. Results of this Delphi survey may be applied to clinical outcomes research as an objective measure of short-term recovery. Furthermore, standardized endpoints identified through this process may be used in clinical practice to guide decisions regarding patient discharge and may help to reduce the risk of premature discharge or prolonged admission.",0
42,Intermittent Versus Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Relapsing or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Phase 3b Randomised Study (ICELAND),"Background:
        
      
      Intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) has received increasing attention; however, the current literature is still limited, especially in nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa), and the relative efficacy and safety benefits of IAD versus continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) remain unclear.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To add to the knowledge base regarding efficacy and potential benefits, including reduced side effects and improved quality of life (QoL), of IAD versus CAD in patients with nonmetastatic relapsing or locally advanced PCa.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A 42-mo phase 3b open-label randomised study in 933 patients from 20 European countries.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Following a 6-mo induction with leuprorelin acetate (Eligard) 22.5mg 3-mo depot, patients were randomised to CAD or IAD with leuprorelin for 36 mo.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      The primary end point was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression while receiving luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist, defined as three consecutive increasing PSA values ≥ 4 ng/ml ≥ 2 wk apart. Secondary end points included PSA progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), testosterone levels, performance status, and QoL.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      A total of 933 patients entered the induction phase; 701 were randomised. The median number of injections administered after randomisation was 12 (range: 1-12) for the CAD group and 3 (range: 1-10) for the IAD group. There were no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences between the groups for time to PSA progression, PSA PFS, OS, mean PSA levels over time, or QoL. A similar number of adverse events was observed in each group; the most common were hot flushes and hypertension. Study limitations include the open-label design and absence of formal testosterone recovery assessment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      IAD and CAD demonstrated similar efficacy, tolerability, and QoL in men with nonmetastatic PCa. The principal benefit of IAD compared with CAD is a potential cost reduction with comparable OS rates. There are no apparent QoL benefits.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      This randomised trial showed that both intermittent and continuous hormone therapy had similar efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life profiles in patients with relapsing M0 or locally advanced prostate cancer. Intermittent therapy may be a valid option for selected patients.

      The Accreditation and Certification of Hernia Centers and Surgeons (ACCESS) Group of the European Hernia Society (EHS) recognizes that there is a growing need to train specialist abdominal wall surgeons. The most important and relevant argument for this proposal and statement is the growing acceptance of the increasing complexity of abdominal wall surgery due to newer techniques, more challenging cases and the required 'tailored' approach to such surgery. There is now also an increasing public awareness with social media, whereby optimal treatment results are demanded by patients. However, to date the complexity of abdominal wall surgery has not been properly or adequately defined in the current literature.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search of the available literature was performed in May 2019 using Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Springer Link, and the Cochrane Library, with 75 publications identified as relevant. In addition, an analysis of data from the Herniamed Hernia Registry was performed. The percentage of patients with hernia- or patient-related characteristics which unfavorably impacted the outcome of inguinal and incisional hernia repair was also calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All present guidelines for abdominal wall surgery recommend the utilization of a 'tailored' approach. This relies on the prerequisite that any surgical technique used has already been mastered, as well as the recognized learning curves for each of the several techniques that can be used for both inguinal hernia (Lichtenstein, TEP, TAPP, Shouldice) and incisional hernia repairs (laparoscopic IPOM, open sublay, open IPOM, open onlay, open or endoscopic component separation technique). Other hernia- and patient-related characteristics that have recognized complexity include emergency surgery, obesity, recurrent hernias, bilateral inguinal hernias, groin hernia in women, scrotal hernias, large defects, high ASA scores, > 80 years of age, increased medical risk factors and previous lower abdominal surgery. The proportion of patients with at least one of these characteristics in the Herniamed Hernia Registry in the case of both inguinal and incisional hernia is noted to be relatively high at around 70%. In general surgery training approximately 50-100 hernia repairs on average are performed by each trainee, with around only 25 laparo-endoscopic procedures.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A tailored approach is now employed and seen more so in hernia surgery and this fact is referred to and highlighted in the contemporaneous hernia guidelines published to date. In addition, with the increasing complexity of abdominal wall surgery, the number of procedures actually performed by trainees is no longer considered adequate to overcome any recognized learning curve. Therefore, to supplement general surgery training young surgeons should be offered a clinical fellowship to obtain an additional qualification as an abdominal wall surgeon and thus improve their clinical and operative experience under supervision in this field. Practicing general surgeons with a special interest in hernia surgery can undertake intensive further training in this area by participating in clinical work shadowing in hernia centers, workshops and congresses.",3
44,Early diagnosis and better rhythm management to improve outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation: the 8th AFNET/EHRA consensus conference,"Aims:
        
      
      Despite marked progress in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), detecting AF remains difficult and AF-related complications cause unacceptable morbidity and mortality even on optimal current therapy.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      This document summarizes the key outcomes of the 8th AFNET/EHRA Consensus Conference of the Atrial Fibrillation NETwork (AFNET) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA). Eighty-three international experts met in Hamburg for 2 days in October 2021. Results of the interdisciplinary, hybrid discussions in breakout groups and the plenary based on recently published and unpublished observations are summarized in this consensus paper to support improved care for patients with AF by guiding prevention, individualized management, and research strategies. The main outcomes are (i) new evidence supports a simple, scalable, and pragmatic population-based AF screening pathway; (ii) rhythm management is evolving from therapy aimed at improving symptoms to an integrated domain in the prevention of AF-related outcomes, especially in patients with recently diagnosed AF; (iii) improved characterization of atrial cardiomyopathy may help to identify patients in need for therapy; (iv) standardized assessment of cognitive function in patients with AF could lead to improvement in patient outcomes; and (v) artificial intelligence (AI) can support all of the above aims, but requires advanced interdisciplinary knowledge and collaboration as well as a better medico-legal framework.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Implementation of new evidence-based approaches to AF screening and rhythm management can improve outcomes in patients with AF. Additional benefits are possible with further efforts to identify and target atrial cardiomyopathy and cognitive impairment, which can be facilitated by AI.",0
45,Effects of Robot-Assisted Training for the Unaffected Arm in Patients with Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy: A Proof-of-Concept Pilot Study,"On a voluntary basis, 10 adolescents with hemiparesis due to cerebral palsy and 11 neurologically healthy control subjects participated in this proof-of-concept pilot study. The aim was to examine the effects of robot-assisted training for the unaffected arm in patients with hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Baseline comparison between the unaffected arm of the hemiparetic patients with cerebral palsy and the dominant arm of healthy control subjects showed significant differences on the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function test and action planning ability tests. Within-group comparison after ten 30-minute sessions (five days a week for two consecutive weeks) of robot-assisted training for the unaffected arm showed significant improvements in patients with cerebral palsy on the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function test (performed at both hands) and action planning ability test (evaluated at the unaffected arm). Our findings are in line with previous evidences of action planning deficits at the unaffected arm in patients with hemiparetic cerebral palsy and support the hypothesis that robot-assisted training for the unaffected arm may be useful to improve manual dexterity and action planning in patients with hemiparesis due to cerebral palsy.",6
46,Long term oncologic and reproductive outcomes after robot-assisted radical trachelectomy for early-stage cervical cancer. An international multicenter study,"Objectives:
        
      
      Long term outcomes following fertility sparing robot-assisted radical trachelectomy (RRT).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective study of consecutive women selected for RRT between 2007 and 2019 at five referral centres. Generally used selection criteria for fertility-sparing surgery were applied. Oncologic, reproductive and long-term clinical data were analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 166 included women, 149 completed a RRT. Median tumor size was 9 mm (range 3-20 mm), 111 women (75%) had FIGO 2009 stage IB1 cancer and 4.8% were node positive. At a median follow up of 58 months, 12 of all women (7.2%) and 9 of 149 women (6%) who underwent completed RRT with fertility preservation had recurred and two had died. 70 of 88 women (80%) who attempted to conceive succeeded, resulting in 81 pregnancies that progressed beyond the first trimester and 76 live births of which 54 (70%) were delivered at term and 65 (86%) delivered after gestational week 32. A short postoperative cervical length was associated with impaired fertility. A late secondary hysterectomy was necessary in four women due to persistent bleeding (n = 2), hematometra due to a cervical stenosis (n = 1) and recurrent dysplasia (n = 1).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this long-term follow-up of RRT the recurrence rate is comparable to larger individual studies of minimally invasive or vaginal radical trachelectomy with similar risk profile and follow up. The high pregnancy rate and low rate of premature delivery before 32 weeks GA may promote the use of robot-assisted approach.",2
47,Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy vs laparoscopic cryoablation for the small renal mass: redefining the minimally invasive 'gold standard',"Objective:
        
      
      To identify differences between the ablative and extirpative minimally invasive techniques of laparoscopic cryoablation (LC) and robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RPN), respectively, in treating small renal tumours in terms of safety, peri-operative morbidity and early oncological outcomes.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Between June 2008 and April 2012 56 patients underwent LC and from October 2010 to April 2012, 47 patients underwent RPN using the Da Vinci robotic platform (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Data on intra-operative, postoperative and oncological outcomes were collected prospectively, and were analysed and compared for both groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median patient ages were 69 and 60 for the LC and RPN groups, respectively (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in disease stage, but there was a significant difference in tumour size, with patients in the RPN group having larger tumours. The mean operating times were 146 and 159 min for the LC and RPN groups, respectively (P = 0.094) and the mean blood loss was 47 and 94 mL for the LC and the RPN groups, respectively (P = 0.251). The median length of hospital stay (1 day) was the same for both groups and the mean warm ischaemia time was 23 min in the RPN group. The marginal change in preoperative and 6-week postoperative renal function was recorded: the mean postoperative increase in serum creatinine was 5.4 mmol/L in the LC group and 9.2 mmol/L in the RPN group. Of the 47 patients in the RPN group, two (4.3%) were converted to laparoscopic radical nephrectomy because of difficulty in controlling bleeding during hilar dissection. Only two patients (3.6%) had recurrence in the LC group, both of whom were treated with re-cryoablation. A total of 5.4% of patients in the LC and 4.3% in the RPN group had Clavien grade I postoperative complications, one patient in the LC group had a Clavien grade II complication, while 1.8 and 4.3% of patients had Clavien IIIb in the LC and RPN groups, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our data confirm that LC is a successful, minimally invasive and safe treatment option for the management of small renal tumours, but the apparently similar characteristics of RPN suggest that an increasing proportion of patients, whatever their age or medical comorbidities, may be reasonably offered a robot-assisted extirpative procedure with the likely benefit of lower risk of local recurrence and need for retreatment.",9
48,[Robotic hernia surgery IV. German version : Robotic parastomal hernia repair. Video report and preliminary results],"The surgical treatment of parastomal hernias is considered complex and is known to be prone to complications. Traditionally, this condition was treated using relocation techniques or local suture repairs. Since then, several mesh-based techniques have been proposed and are nowadays used in minimally invasive surgery. Since the introduction of robot-assisted surgery to the field of abdominal wall surgery, several adaptations to these techniques have been made, which may significantly improve patient outcomes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of available techniques in robot-assisted parastomal hernia repair. Technical considerations and preliminary results of robot-assisted modified Sugarbaker repair, robot-assisted Pauli technique, and minimally invasive use of a funnel-shaped mesh in the treatment of parastomal hernias are presented. Furthermore, challenges in robot-assisted ileal conduit parastomal hernia repair are discussed. These techniques are illustrated by photographic and video material. Besides providing a comprehensive overview of robot-assisted parastomal hernia repair, this article focuses on the specific advantages of robot-assisted techniques in the treatment of this condition.",3
49,Day-case catheterless and drainless minimal-access pyeloplasty in adults: A single-center experience of 13 years,"Objectives:
        
      
      To analyze our practice of drainless and catheterless day-case minimal-access pyeloplasty with regard to feasibility, safety and long-term outcomes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients undergoing minimal-access pyeloplasty (laparoscopic, with or without robotic assistance) in a single center between 2007 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational study. Patient demographics and the success rate of day-case discharge along with postoperative outcomes were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 129 patients underwent minimal-access pyeloplasty in this time period, of whom 116 met the inclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 48 years. A total of 65% of the patients (n = 75) were discharged on the same day and 88% (n = 101) were discharged within 23 h of surgery. Of the 14 patients with a hospital stay of >24 h, pain was the most common reason (60%) for delayed discharge. The overall subjective (pain-free status) and objective (unobstructed drainage) success rates were 91% and 86%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrates that routine drains or urethral catheters are not necessary in minimal-access pyeloplasty, and their omission could facilitate early recovery and day-case discharge without compromising long-term surgical outcomes. Large randomized controlled studies are required to prospectively evaluate outcomes.",2
50,"Training During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Knowledge, Beliefs, and Practices of 12,526 Athletes from 142 Countries and Six Continents","Objective:
        
      
      Our objective was to explore the training-related knowledge, beliefs, and practices of athletes and the influence of lockdowns in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Athletes (n = 12,526, comprising 13% world class, 21% international, 36% national, 24% state, and 6% recreational) completed an online survey that was available from 17 May to 5 July 2020 and explored their training behaviors (training knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, and practices), including specific questions on their training intensity, frequency, and session duration before and during lockdown (March-June 2020).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 85% of athletes wanted to ""maintain training,"" and 79% disagreed with the statement that it is ""okay to not train during lockdown,"" with a greater prevalence for both in higher-level athletes. In total, 60% of athletes considered ""coaching by correspondence (remote coaching)"" to be sufficient (highest amongst world-class athletes). During lockdown, < 40% were able to maintain sport-specific training (e.g., long endurance [39%], interval training [35%], weightlifting [33%], plyometric exercise [30%]) at pre-lockdown levels (higher among world-class, international, and national athletes), with most (83%) training for ""general fitness and health maintenance"" during lockdown. Athletes trained alone (80%) and focused on bodyweight (65%) and cardiovascular (59%) exercise/training during lockdown. Compared with before lockdown, most athletes reported reduced training frequency (from between five and seven sessions per week to four or fewer), shorter training sessions (from ≥ 60 to < 60 min), and lower sport-specific intensity (~ 38% reduction), irrespective of athlete classification.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      COVID-19-related lockdowns saw marked reductions in athletic training specificity, intensity, frequency, and duration, with notable within-sample differences (by athlete classification). Higher classification athletes had the strongest desire to ""maintain"" training and the greatest opposition to ""not training"" during lockdowns. These higher classification athletes retained training specificity to a greater degree than others, probably because of preferential access to limited training resources. More higher classification athletes considered ""coaching by correspondence"" as sufficient than did lower classification athletes. These lockdown-mediated changes in training were not conducive to maintenance or progression of athletes' physical capacities and were also likely detrimental to athletes' mental health. These data can be used by policy makers, athletes, and their multidisciplinary teams to modulate their practice, with a degree of individualization, in the current and continued pandemic-related scenario. Furthermore, the data may drive training-related educational resources for athletes and their multidisciplinary teams. Such upskilling would provide athletes with evidence to inform their training modifications in response to germane situations (e.g., COVID related, injury, and illness).",3
51,Spatial awareness in robotic theatre,"As surgical and anaesthetic procedures become more complex, operating theatres need to be larger and multi-purpose to accommodate specialist equipment such as the Da Vinci Robot. The Da Vinci theatre at The Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust (RWT) is a modern theatre equipped and designed specifically for robotic surgery. When we first began to perform robotic surgery at RWT we faced many challenges on how to maximise the space available to us, whilst striving to minimise the chance of desterilisation.",3
52,Simulation-based training and assessment in urological surgery,"Simulation has become widely accepted as a supplementary method of training. Within urology, the greatest number of procedure-specific models and subsequent validation studies have been carried out in the field of endourology. Many generic-skills simulators have been created for laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery, but only a limited number of procedure-specific models are available. By contrast, open urological simulation has only seen a handful of validated models. Of the available modalities, virtual reality (VR) simulators are most commonly used for endourology and robotic surgery training, the former also employing many high-fidelity bench models. Smaller dry-lab and ex vivo animal models have been used for laparoscopic and robotic training, whereas live animals and human cadavers are widely used for full procedural training. Newer concepts such as augmented-reality (AR) models and patient-specific simulators have also been introduced. Several curricula, including one recommended within, have been produced, incorporating various different training modalities and nontechnical skills training techniques. Such curricula and validated models should be used in a structured fashion to supplement operating room training.",3
53,Nursing considerations for patients undergoing robotic-arm assisted joint replacements,"Robotic-arm assisted arthroplasty (RAA) has gained popularity over the past decade because of its ability to provide more accurate implant positioning with less surgical trauma than conventional manual arthroplasty. It has shown better early functional outcomes, less postoperative pain and shorter inpatient stays. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in improving overall outcomes and ensuring this technology is implemented efficiently and safely, but there is limited published literature on the nursing considerations for managing patients undergoing RAA. This article aims to provide a pragmatic approach for nursing care in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phases of RAA.",0
54,An observational study of volume-outcome effects for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in England,"Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate volume-outcome relationships in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for cancer using data from the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database for England.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Data for all adult, elective RPs for cancer during the period January 2013-December 2018 (inclusive) were extracted from the HES database. The HES database records data on all National Health Service (NHS) hospital admissions in England. Data were extracted for the NHS trust and surgeon undertaking the procedure, the surgical technique used (laparoscopic, open or robot-assisted), hospital length of stay (LOS), emergency readmissions, and deaths. Multilevel modelling was used to adjust for hierarchy and covariates.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data were available for 35 629 RPs (27 945 RARPs). The proportion of procedures conducted as RARPs increased from 53.2% in 2013 to 92.6% in 2018. For RARP, there was a significant relationship between 90-day emergency hospital readmission (primary outcome) and trust volume (odds ratio [OR] for volume decrease of 10 procedures: 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.00; P = 0.037) and surgeon volume (OR for volume decrease of 10 procedures: 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00; P = 0.013) in the previous year. From lowest to highest volume category there was a decline in the adjusted proportion of patients readmitted as an emergency at 90 days from 10.6% (0-49 procedures) to 7.0% (≥300 procedures) for trusts and from 9.4% (0-9 procedures) to 8.3% (≥100 procedures) for surgeons. LOS was also significantly associated with surgeon and trust volume, although 1-year mortality was associated with neither.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is evidence of a volume-outcome relationship for RARP in England and minimising low-volume RARP will improve patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the observed effect size was relatively modest, and stakeholders should be realistic when evaluating the likely impact of further centralisation at a population level.",5
55,Patient satisfaction with robotic surgery,"This study is a service evaluation of the robotic-assisted surgery service within the Gynaecology Oncology department at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. The aim is not only to evaluate and improve this new service within the department, but also to add to the available literature that reviews patient satisfaction with robotic-assisted surgery. An anonymous questionnaire was developed with questions taken from the NHS User Experience Survey Question Bank and additional questions in the same format specific to robotic-assisted surgery. This was posted to the first 140 patients to have undergone robotic-assisted surgery within Gynae Oncology at STH. One hundred completed questionnaires were returned. Over 90% of patients were pleased with the care that they received pre-operatively and felt that they have enough input into the decisions made about treatment. Half of patients (51%) reported having pain post-procedure, with a quarter of these patients experiencing severe pain. The majority of patients (72%) felt that their length of stay in hospital was of the right duration. Almost all patients (99%) were pleased with the overall care that they received and 91% would recommend robotic-assisted surgery as a modality. Patients are very satisfied with the care that they receive when undergoing robotic-assisted surgery within Gynae Oncology at our center and the majority of patients would recommend robotic-assisted surgery as a modality.",3
56,Next-Generation Robotic Head and Neck Surgery,"Following the inception of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in 2005, the field of robotic head and neck surgery has undergone refinement and innovation. Optimizing patient outcome, preserving function, and limiting morbidity are the key drivers. The next leap forward is another generation of flexible robotic surgical systems. Several such systems are under clinical and preclinical evaluation. A new single-port (Sp) robotic surgical architecture is now available integrating three fully articulating instruments and a flexible three-dimensional high-definition camera delivered through a 25-mm cannula. Preclinical feasibility studies of the Sp in human cadaver and porcine models suggest improved application compared to existing platforms for oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal resection. With 3-handed manipulation of tissue, traction and countertraction may be used to deliver a more precise surgical dissection of head and neck anatomy than is currently possible. The single-port design permits greater access and maneuverability for the bedside surgical assistant. An alternative currently available in clinical use includes the Flex® system using a robotic camera and manually controlled endoscopic instruments. The Cambridge Medical Robotics Versius system is undergoing preclinical evaluation for TORS and may offer a novel modular approach. All of these systems allow the head and neck surgeon to reach further beyond the upper aerodigestive tract with greater agility and precision, expanding the boundaries of minimal access head and neck surgery.",1
57,Flexible robotics in pelvic disease: does the catheter increase applicability of embolic therapy?,"Interventional radiology procedures, equipment, and techniques as well as image guidance have developed dramatically over the last few decades. The evidence for minimally invasive interventions in vascular and oncology fields is rapidly growing and several procedures are considered the first line management. However, radiation exposure, image guidance and innovative solutions to known anatomical challenges are still lagging behind. Robotic technology and its role in surgery have been developing at a steady speed. Endovascular robotics are following suit with a different set of problems and targets. This article discusses the advances and limitations in one aspects of endovascular robotic, namely pelvic pathology that includes aneurysms, fibroids, benign prostatic hypertrophy and vascular malformation.",1
58,Establishing key research questions for the implementation of artificial intelligence in colonoscopy: a modified Delphi method,"BACKGROUND : Artificial intelligence (AI) research in colonoscopy is progressing rapidly but widespread clinical implementation is not yet a reality. We aimed to identify the top implementation research priorities. METHODS : An established modified Delphi approach for research priority setting was used. Fifteen international experts, including endoscopists and translational computer scientists/engineers, from nine countries participated in an online survey over 9 months. Questions related to AI implementation in colonoscopy were generated as a long-list in the first round, and then scored in two subsequent rounds to identify the top 10 research questions. RESULTS : The top 10 ranked questions were categorized into five themes. Theme 1: clinical trial design/end points (4 questions), related to optimum trial designs for polyp detection and characterization, determining the optimal end points for evaluation of AI, and demonstrating impact on interval cancer rates. Theme 2: technological developments (3 questions), including improving detection of more challenging and advanced lesions, reduction of false-positive rates, and minimizing latency. Theme 3: clinical adoption/integration (1 question), concerning the effective combination of detection and characterization into one workflow. Theme 4: data access/annotation (1 question), concerning more efficient or automated data annotation methods to reduce the burden on human experts. Theme 5: regulatory approval (1 question), related to making regulatory approval processes more efficient. CONCLUSIONS : This is the first reported international research priority setting exercise for AI in colonoscopy. The study findings should be used as a framework to guide future research with key stakeholders to accelerate the clinical implementation of AI in endoscopy.",0
59,Risk Factors of Positive Resection Margin in Laparoscopic and Open Liver Surgery for Colorectal Liver Metastases: A New Perspective in the Perioperative Assessment: A European Multicenter Study,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the risk factors associated with R1 resection in patients undergoing OLS and LLS for CRLMs.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The clinical impact of R1 resection in liver surgery for CRLMs has been continuously appraised, but R1 risk factors have not been clearly defined yet.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cohort study of patients who underwent OLS and LLS for CRLMs in 9 European high-volume referral centers was performed. A multivariate analysis and the receiver operating characteristic curves were used to investigate the risk factors for R1 resection. A model predicting the likelihood of R1 resection was developed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 3387 consecutive liver resections for CRLMs were included. OLS was performed in 1792 cases whereas LLS in 1595; the R1 resection rate was 14% and 14.2%, respectively. The risk factors for R1 resection were: the type of resection (nonanatomic and anatomic/nonanatomic), the number of nodules and the size of tumor. In the LLS group only, blood loss was a risk factor, whereas the Pringle maneuver had a protective effect. The predictive size of tumor for R1 resection was >45 mm in OLS and >30 mm in LLS, > 2 lesions was significative in both groups and blood loss >350 cc in LLS. The model was able to predict R1 resection in OLS (area under curve 0.712; 95% confidence interval 0.665-0.739) and in LLS (area under curve 0.724; 95% confidence interval 0.671-0.745).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The study describes the risk factors for R1 resection after liver surgery for CRLMs, which may be used to plan better the perioperative strategies to reduce the incidence of R1 resection during OLS and LLS.",9
60,Coronary access following ACURATE neo implantation for transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation: Ex vivo analysis in patient-specific anatomies,"Background:
        
      
      Coronary access after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with supra-annular self-expandable valves may be challenging or un-feasible. There is little data concerning coronary access following transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) for degenerated surgical bioprosthesis.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To evaluate the feasibility and challenge of coronary access after ViV-TAVI with the supra-annular self-expandable ACURATE neo valve.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Sixteen patients underwent ViV-TAVI with the ACURATE neo valve. Post-procedural computed tomography (CT) was used to create 3D-printed life-sized patient-specific models for bench-testing of coronary cannulation. Primary endpoint was feasibility of diagnostic angiography and PCI. Secondary endpoints included incidence of challenging cannulation for both diagnostic catheters (DC) and guiding catheters (GC). The association between challenging cannulations with aortic and transcatheter/surgical valve geometry was evaluated using pre and post-procedural CT scans.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Diagnostic angiography and PCI were feasible for 97 and 95% of models respectively. All non-feasible procedures occurred in ostia that underwent prophylactic ""chimney"" stenting. DC cannulation was challenging in 17% of models and was associated with a narrower SoV width (30 vs. 35 mm, p < 0.01), STJ width (28 vs. 32 mm, p < 0.05) and shorter STJ height (15 vs. 17 mm, p < 0.05). GC cannulation was challenging in 23% of models and was associated with narrower STJ width (28 vs. 32 mm, p < 0.05), smaller transcatheter-to-coronary distance (5 vs. 9.2 mm, p < 0.05) and a worse coronary-commissural overlap angle (14.3° vs. 25.6 o , p < 0.01). Advanced techniques to achieve GC cannulation were required in 22/64 (34%) of cases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this exploratory bench analysis, diagnostic angiography and PCI was feasible in almost all cases following ViV-TAVI with the ACURATE neo valve. Prophylactic coronary stenting, higher implantation, narrower aortic sinus dimensions and commissural misalignment were associated with an increased challenge of coronary cannulation.",0
61,European Hernia Society guidelines on prevention and treatment of parastomal hernias,"Background:
        
      
      International guidelines on the prevention and treatment of parastomal hernias are lacking. The European Hernia Society therefore implemented a Clinical Practice Guideline development project.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The guidelines development group consisted of general, hernia and colorectal surgeons, a biostatistician and a biologist, from 14 European countries. These guidelines conformed to the AGREE II standards and the GRADE methodology. The databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and the gray literature through OpenGrey were searched. Quality assessment was performed using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists. The guidelines were presented at the 38th European Hernia Society Congress and each key question was evaluated in a consensus voting of congress participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      End colostomy is associated with a higher incidence of parastomal hernia, compared to other types of stomas. Clinical examination is necessary for the diagnosis of parastomal hernia, whereas computed tomography scan or ultrasonography may be performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Currently available classifications are not validated; however, we suggest the use of the European Hernia Society classification for uniform research reporting. There is insufficient evidence on the policy of watchful waiting, the route and location of stoma construction, and the size of the aperture. The use of a prophylactic synthetic non-absorbable mesh upon construction of an end colostomy is strongly recommended. No such recommendation can be made for other types of stomas at present. It is strongly recommended to avoid performing a suture repair for elective parastomal hernia. So far, there is no sufficient comparative evidence on specific techniques, open or laparoscopic surgery and specific mesh types. However, a mesh without a hole is suggested in preference to a keyhole mesh when laparoscopic repair is performed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      An evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of parastomal hernias reveals the lack of evidence on several topics, which need to be addressed by multicenter trials. Parastomal hernia prevention using a prophylactic mesh for end colostomies reduces parastomal herniation. Clinical outcomes should be audited and adverse events must be reported.",3
62,Propagation of beta/gamma rhythms in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits of the parkinsonian rat,"Much of the motor impairment associated with Parkinson's disease is thought to arise from pathological activity in the networks formed by the basal ganglia (BG) and motor cortex. To evaluate several hypotheses proposed to explain the emergence of pathological oscillations in parkinsonism, we investigated changes to the directed connectivity in BG networks following dopamine depletion. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the cortex and basal ganglia of rats rendered parkinsonian by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and in dopamine-intact controls. We performed systematic analyses of the networks using a novel tool for estimation of directed interactions (nonparametric directionality, NPD). We used a ""conditioned"" version of the NPD analysis that reveals the dependence of the correlation between two signals on a third reference signal. We find evidence of the dopamine dependency of both low-beta (14-20 Hz) and high-beta/low-gamma (20-40 Hz) directed network interactions. Notably, 6-OHDA lesions were associated with enhancement of the cortical ""hyperdirect"" connection to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and its feedback to the cortex and striatum. We find that pathological beta synchronization resulting from 6-OHDA lesioning is widely distributed across the network and cannot be located to any individual structure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that high-beta/gamma oscillations propagate through the striatum in a pathway that is independent of STN. Rhythms at high beta/gamma show susceptibility to conditioning that indicates a hierarchical organization compared with those at low beta. These results further inform our understanding of the substrates for pathological rhythms in salient brain networks in parkinsonism. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We present a novel analysis of electrophysiological recordings in the cortico-basal ganglia network with the aim of evaluating several hypotheses concerning the origins of abnormal brain rhythms associated with Parkinson's disease. We present evidence for changes in the directed connections within the network following chronic dopamine depletion in rodents. These findings speak to the plausibility of a ""short-circuiting"" of the network that gives rise to the conditions from which pathological synchronization may arise.",6
63,Laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis,"Background:
        
      
      Endometriosis is associated with pain and infertility. Surgical interventions aim to remove visible areas of endometriosis and restore the anatomy.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of pain and infertility associated with endometriosis.
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group including searching the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, reference lists for relevant trials, and trial registries from inception to April 2020.
    


          Selection criteria:
        
      
      We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic surgery with any other laparoscopic or robotic intervention, holistic or medical treatment, or diagnostic laparoscopy only.
    


          Data collection and analysis:
        
      
      Two review authors independently performed selection of studies, assessment of trial quality and extraction of relevant data with disagreements resolved by a third review author. We collected data for the core outcome set for endometriosis. Primary outcomes included overall pain and live birth. We evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      We included 14 RCTs. The studies randomised 1563 women with endometriosis. Four RCTs compared laparoscopic ablation or excision with diagnostic laparoscopy only. Two RCTs compared laparoscopic excision with diagnostic laparoscopy only. One RCT compared laparoscopic ablation or excision with laparoscopic ablation or excision and uterine suspension. Two RCTs compared laparoscopic ablation and uterine nerve transection with diagnostic laparoscopy only. One RCT compared laparoscopic ablation with diagnostic laparoscopy and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. Two RCTs compared laparoscopic ablation with laparoscopic excision. One RCT compared laparoscopic ablation or excision with helium thermal coagulator with laparoscopic ablation or excision with electrodiathermy. One RCT compared conservative laparoscopic surgery with laparoscopic colorectal resection of deep endometriosis infiltrating the rectum. Common limitations in the primary studies included lack of clearly described blinding, failure to fully describe methods of randomisation and allocation concealment, and poor reporting of outcome data. Laparoscopic treatment versus diagnostic laparoscopy We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic treatment on overall pain scores compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only at six months (mean difference (MD) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.49; 1 RCT, 16 participants; very low quality evidence) and at 12 months (MD 1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.19; 1 RCT, 16 participants; very low quality evidence), where a positive value means pain relief (the higher the score, the more pain relief) and a negative value reflects pain increase (the lower the score, the worse the increase in pain). No studies looked at live birth. We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic treatment on quality of life compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only: EuroQol-5D index summary at six months (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.18; 1 RCT, 39 participants; low quality evidence), 12-item Short Form (SF-12) mental health component (MD 2.30, 95% CI -4.50 to 9.10; 1 RCT, 39 participants; low quality evidence) and SF-12 physical health component (MD 2.70, 95% CI -2.90 to 8.30; 1 RCT, 39 participants; low quality evidence). Laparoscopic treatment probably improves viable intrauterine pregnancy rate compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only (odds ratio (OR) 1.89, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.86; 3 RCTs, 528 participants; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic treatment compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only on ectopic pregnancy (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 13.48; 1 RCT, 100 participants; low quality evidence) and miscarriage (MD 0.94, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.54; 2 RCTs, 112 participants; low quality evidence). There was limited reporting of adverse events. No conversions to laparotomy were reported in both groups (1 RCT, 341 participants). Laparoscopic ablation and uterine nerve transection versus diagnostic laparoscopy We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic ablation and uterine nerve transection on adverse events (more specifically vascular injury) compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32; 1 RCT, 141 participants; low quality evidence). No studies looked at overall pain scores (at six and 12 months), live birth, quality of life, viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound, ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. Laparoscopic ablation versus laparoscopic excision There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference in overall pain, measured at 12 months, for laparoscopic ablation compared with laparoscopic excision (MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.22 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 103 participants; very low quality evidence). No studies looked at overall pain scores at six months, live birth, quality of life, viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and adverse events. Helium thermal coagulator versus electrodiathermy We are uncertain whether helium thermal coagulator compared to electrodiathermy improves quality of life using the 30-item Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30) at nine months, when considering the components: pain (MD 6.68, 95% CI -3.07 to 16.43; 1 RCT, 119 participants; very low quality evidence), control and powerlessness (MD 4.79, 95% CI -6.92 to 16.50; 1 RCT, 119 participants; very low quality evidence), emotional well-being (MD 6.17, 95% CI -3.95 to 16.29; 1 RCT, 119 participants; very low quality evidence) and social support (MD 5.62, 95% CI -6.21 to 17.45; 1 RCT, 119 participants; very low quality evidence). Adverse events were not estimable. No studies looked at overall pain scores (at six and 12 months), live birth, viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound, ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage.
    


          Authors' conclusions:
        
      
      Compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only, it is uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery reduces overall pain associated with minimal to severe endometriosis. No data were reported on live birth. There is moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic surgery increases viable intrauterine pregnancy rates confirmed by ultrasound compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. No studies were found that looked at live birth for any of the comparisons. Further research is needed considering the management of different subtypes of endometriosis and comparing laparoscopic interventions with lifestyle and medical interventions. There was insufficient evidence on adverse events to allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding safety.",2
64,Adjuvant nivolumab for stage III/IV melanoma: evaluation of safety outcomes and association with recurrence-free survival,"Background:
        
      
      Several therapeutic options are now available in the adjuvant melanoma setting, mandating an understanding of their benefit‒risk profiles in order to make informed treatment decisions. Herein we characterize adjuvant nivolumab select (immune-related) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and evaluate possible associations between safety and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the phase III CheckMate 238 trial.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with resected stage IIIB-C or IV melanoma received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=452) or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses and then every 12 weeks (n=453) for up to 1 year or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. First-occurrence and all-occurrence select TRAEs were analyzed within discrete time intervals: from 0 to 3 months of treatment, from >3-12 months of treatment, and from the last dose (regardless of early or per-protocol treatment discontinuation) to 100 days after the last dose. Possible associations between select TRAEs and RFS were investigated post randomization in 3-month landmark analyses and in Cox model analyses (including a time-varying covariate of select TRAE), within and between treatment groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From the first nivolumab dose to 100 days after the last dose, first-occurrence select TRAEs were reported in 67.7% (306/452) of patients. First-occurrence select TRAEs were reported most frequently from 0 to 3 months (48.0%), during which the most common were pruritus (15.5%) and diarrhea (15.3%). Most select TRAEs resolved within 6 months. There was no clear association between the occurrence (or not) of select TRAEs and RFS by landmark analysis or by Cox model analysis within treatment arms or comparing nivolumab to the ipilimumab comparator arm.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Results of this safety analysis of nivolumab in adjuvant melanoma were consistent with its established safety profile. In the discrete time intervals evaluated, most first-occurrence TRAEs occurred early during treatment and resolved. No association between RFS and select TRAEs was evident.

65,Perioperative outcomes and adverse events of robotic colorectal resections for inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic literature review,"The purpose of this study was to assess outcome measures and cost-effectiveness of robotic colorectal resections in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline and Embase databases were reviewed, using the text ""robotic(s)"" AND (""inflammatory bowel disease"" OR ""Crohn's"" OR ""Ulcerative Colitis""). Two investigators screened abstracts for eligibility. All English language full-text articles were reviewed for specified outcomes. Data were presented in a summarised and aggregate form, since the lack of higher-level evidence studies precluded meta-analysis. Primary outcomes included mortality and postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included readmission rate, length of stay, conversion rate, procedure time, estimated blood loss and functional outcome. The tertiary outcome was cost-effectiveness. Eight studies (3 case-matched observational studies, 4 case series and 1 case report) met the inclusion criteria. There was no reported mortality. Overall, complications occurred in 81 patients (54%) including 30 (20%) Clavien-Dindo III-IV complications. Mean length of stay was 8.6 days. Eleven cases (7.3%) were converted to open. The mean robotic operating time was 99 min out of a mean total operating time of 298.6 min. Thirty-two patients (24.7%) were readmitted. Functional outcomes were comparable among robotic, laparoscopic and open approaches. Case-matched observational studies comparing robotic to laparoscopic surgery revealed a significantly longer procedure time; however, conversion, complication, length of stay and readmission rates were similar. The case-matched observational study comparing robotic to open surgery also revealed a longer procedure time and a higher readmission rate; postoperative complication rates and length of stay were similar. No studies compared cost-effectiveness between robotic and traditional approaches. Although robotic resections for inflammatory bowel disease are technically feasible, outcomes must be interpreted with caution due to low-quality studies.",2
66,Users' Affective and Cognitive Responses to Humanoid Robots in Different Expertise Service Contexts,"The uncanny valley (UCV) model is an influential human-robot interaction theory that explains the relationship between the resemblance that robots have to humans and attitudes toward robots. Despite its extraordinary worth, this model remains untested in certain respects. One current limitation is that the model has only been examined in general or context-free situations. Given that humanoids function in the world beyond laboratories, investigating the UCV in specific and actual situations is critical. Additionally, few studies have examined the impact of affective responses presented in the UCV to other appraisals of humanoids. To address these issues, this study explored affective and cognitive responses to humanoids in specific service situations. In particular, we examined the effect of affective responses on trust, which is regarded as a critical cognitive factor influencing technology adoption, in two service contexts: hotel reception (low expertise) and tutoring (high expertise). By providing a richer understanding of human both affective and cognitive reactions to humanoids, our findings expand the UCV theory and ultimately contribute to research regarding user adoption of service robots.",4
67,A systematic review of robot-assisted cholecystectomy to examine the quality of reporting in relation to the IDEAL recommendations: systematic review,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic cholecystectomy (RC) is a recent innovation in minimally invasive gallbladder surgery. The IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, long-term study) framework aims to provide a safe method for evaluating innovative procedures. This study aimed to understand how RC was introduced, in accordance with IDEAL guidelines.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic searches were used to identify studies reporting RC. Eligible studies were classified according to IDEAL stage and data were collected on general study characteristics, patient selection, governance procedures, surgeon/centre expertise, and outcome reporting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1425 abstracts screened, 90 studies were included (5 case reports, 38 case series, 44 non-randomized comparative studies, and 3 randomized clinical trials). Sixty-four were single-centre and 15 were prospective. No authors described their work in the context of IDEAL. One study was classified as IDEAL stage 1, 43 as IDEAL 2a, 43 as IDEAL 2b, and three as IDEAL 3. Sixty-four and 51 provided inclusion and exclusion criteria respectively. Ethical approval was reported in 51 and conflicts of interest in 34. Only 21 reported provision of training for surgeons in RC. A total of 864 outcomes were reported; 198 were used in only one study. Only 30 reported a follow-up interval which, in 13, was 1 month or less.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The IDEAL framework was not followed during the adoption of RC. Few studies were conducted within a research setting, many were retrospective, and outcomes were heterogeneous. There is a need to implement appropriate tools to facilitate the incremental evaluation and reporting of surgical innovation.",3

      To report the fidelity of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme within the Robot-Assisted Training for the Upper Limb after stroke (RATULS) randomized controlled trial, the types of goals selected and the proportion of goals achieved.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Descriptive analysis of data on fidelity, goal selection and achievement from an intervention group within a randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Out-patient stroke rehabilitation within four UK NHS centres.
    


          Subjects:
        
      
      259 participants with moderate-severe upper limb activity limitation (Action Research Arm Test 0-39) between one week and five years post first stroke.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      The enhanced upper limb therapy programme aimed to provide 36 one-hour sessions, including 45 minutes of face-to-face therapy focusing on personal goals, over 12 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      7877/9324 (84%) sessions were attended; a median of 34 [IQR 29-36] per participant. A median of 127 [IQR 70-190] repetitions were achieved per participant per session attended. Based upon the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, goal categories were: self-care 1449/2664 (54%); productivity 374/2664 (14%); leisure 180/2664 (7%) and 'other' 661/2664 (25%). For the 2051/2664 goals for which data were available, 1287 (51%) were achieved, ranging between 27% by participants more than 12 months post stroke with baseline Action Research Arm Test scores 0-7, and 88% by those less than three months after stroke with scores 8-19.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intervention fidelity was high. Goals relating to self-care were most commonly selected. The proportion of goals achieved varied, depending on time post stroke and baseline arm activity limitation.",5
69,Endoscopic video-assisted transoral resection of lateral oropharyngeal tumors,"Endoscopic, video-assisted transoral resection of oropharyngeal tumors is a novel technique carried out using common instruments present in most otolaryngology departments. The technique facilitates oropharyngeal resection akin to transoral robotic surgery (TORS) without the need for a robot. A dual surgeon approach, analogous to that of endoscopic skull base surgery is used. Each surgeon can actively participate in the resection with several key advantages over current techniques. The technique is applicable to departments internationally especially where the use of a robot is prohibited by cost or availability. This is especially important given the resection of oropharyngeal tumours offers the opportunity of single modality treatment or reduced intensity adjuvant treatment compared to traditional non-surgical therapy.",1
70,Robotic vs open distal pancreatectomy: A multi-institutional matched comparison analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Pancreatic surgery is still a challenge even in high-volume centers. Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) represents the greatest contributor to major morbidity and mortality, especially following pancreatic distal resection. In this study, we compared robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) to open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) in terms of CR-POPF development and analyzed oncologic efficacy of RDP in the subgroup of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We collected data from five high-volume centers for pancreatic surgery and performed a matched comparison analysis to compare short and long-term outcomes after ODP or RDP. Patients were matched with a 2:1 ratio according to age, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score, body mass index (BMI), final pathology, and TNM (Tumour, Node, Metastasis) staging system VIII ed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two hundred and forty-six patients who underwent 82 RDPs and 164 ODPs were included. No differences were found in the incidence of CR-POPF. In the PDAC group, median DFS and OS were 10.8 months and 14.8 months in the ODP group and 10.4 months and 15 months in the RDP group, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic distal pancreatectomy is a safe surgical strategy for PDAC and incidence of CR-POPF is equivalent between RDP and ODP. RDP should be considered equivalent to ODP in terms of oncological efficacy when performed in high-volume and proficient centers.",9
71,Robotic simulation experience in undergraduate medical education: a perspective,"Robotic surgery has been one of the most revolutionary advancements in surgery, and demand is anticipated to grow. The performance of robotic surgery has seen an exponential increase in recent years. This is largely due to the benefits offered by robotics, including shorter hospital stays and recovery times, improved visualisation, and fewer postoperative complications. However, due to its expense, only a few specialist centres in the UK offer these techniques, making exposure amongst medical students limited. As final-year medical students, our exposure to simulated robotic surgery gave us a greater appreciation of the associated challenges, such as depth perception, a lack of haptic feedback, and movement economy. Compared to other techniques, robotic simulators provide a greater range of performance measures, allowing one to better adapt to the learning curve. We believe that increasing the exposure of medical students to robotics will be beneficial, allowing future doctors to better inform patients and inspire the next generation of robotic surgeons.",3
72,Robotic-assisted Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Technique Description and Performance Evaluation After 60 Cases,"Purpose:
        
      
      Robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) remains one of the most challenging abdominal operations. During the implementation of new surgical technologies, safety and efficacy outcomes must be rigorously monitored and the learning curve clearly identified.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The authors investigated their experience during the adoption of RPD, analyzing the outcomes of our first 60 consecutive cases, divided into group A (1 to 30) and group B (31 to 60). The cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was used to define the learning curve.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The authors observed a reduction in operative time (125 min) and estimated blood loss (185 mL) between the firsts 1 to 30 and the latest 30 cases. The overall rate of complications showed the tendency to decrease during the experience (46.7% vs. 23.3%, P=0.02), conversely, severe complications and the rate of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula did not show a significant reduction in the incidence (P=0.37 and P=0.67, respectively). The mean number of lymph nodes harvested improved significantly after 30 cases (P=0.004).

      Surgical performance improved significantly after the first 30 cases.",9
73,Clinical and organizational factors associated with mortality during the peak of first COVID-19 wave: the global UNITE-COVID study,"Purpose:
        
      
      To accommodate the unprecedented number of critically ill patients with pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) expansion of the capacity of intensive care unit (ICU) to clinical areas not previously used for critical care was necessary. We describe the global burden of COVID-19 admissions and the clinical and organizational characteristics associated with outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Multicenter, international, point prevalence study, including adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to ICU between February 15th and May 15th, 2020.
    


          Results:
        
      
      4994 patients from 280 ICUs in 46 countries were included. Included ICUs increased their total capacity from 4931 to 7630 beds, deploying personnel from other areas. Overall, 1986 (39.8%) patients were admitted to surge capacity beds. Invasive ventilation at admission was present in 2325 (46.5%) patients and was required during ICU stay in 85.8% of patients. 60-day mortality was 33.9% (IQR across units: 20%-50%) and ICU mortality 32.7%. Older age, invasive mechanical ventilation, and acute kidney injury (AKI) were associated with increased mortality. These associations were also confirmed specifically in mechanically ventilated patients. Admission to surge capacity beds was not associated with mortality, even after controlling for other factors.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ICUs responded to the increase in COVID-19 patients by increasing bed availability and staff, admitting up to 40% of patients in surge capacity beds. Although mortality in this population was high, admission to a surge capacity bed was not associated with increased mortality. Older age, invasive mechanical ventilation, and AKI were identified as the strongest predictors of mortality.",3

75,Nephrometry scores: a validation of three systems for peri-operative outcomes in retroperitoneal robot-assisted partial nephrectomy,"Objective:
        
      
      To externally validate the RENAL, PADUA and SPARE nephrometry scoring systems for use in retroperitoneal robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Nephrometry scores were calculated for 322 consecutive patients receiving retroperitoneal RAPN at a tertiary referral centre from 2017. Patients with multiple tumours were excluded. Scores were correlated with peri-operative outcomes, including the trifecta (warm ischaemia time <25 min, no peri-operative complications and a negative surgical margin), both as continuous and categorical variables. Comparisons were performed using Spearman correlation and ability to predict the trifecta was assessed using binomial logistical regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All three scoring systems correlated significantly with the main variables (operating time, warm ischaemia time and estimated blood loss), both as continuous and categorical variables. Only PADUA and SPARE were able to predict achievement of the trifecta (PADUA area under the curve [AUC] 0.623, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.559-0.668; SPARE AUC 0.612, 95% CI 0.548-0.677).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study validates the RENAL, PADUA and SPARE scoring systems to predict key intra-operative outcomes in retroperitoneal RAPN. Only PADUA and SPARE were able to predict achievement of the trifecta. As a simplified version of the PADUA scoring system with comparable outcomes, we recommend using the SPARE system.",5
76,Frontiers of Medical Robotics: From Concept to Systems to Clinical Translation,"Medical robotics is poised to transform all aspects of medicine-from surgical intervention to targeted therapy, rehabilitation, and hospital automation. A key area is the development of robots for minimally invasive interventions. This review provides a detailed analysis of the evolution of interventional robots and discusses how the integration of imaging, sensing, and robotics can influence the patient care pathway toward precision intervention and patient-specific treatment. It outlines how closer coupling of perception, decision, and action can lead to enhanced dexterity, greater precision, and reduced invasiveness. It provides a critical analysis of some of the key interventional robot platforms developed over the years and their relative merit and intrinsic limitations. The review also presents a future outlook for robotic interventions and emerging trends in making them easier to use, lightweight, ergonomic, and intelligent, and thus smarter, safer, and more accessible for clinical use.",0
77,Transoral Robotic Surgery: Image Guidance and Augmented Reality,"Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is being used increasingly as an alternative to conventional open procedures, as its minimally invasive approach results in significant benefits for the patient. This includes faster recovery times and better functional outcomes, less postoperative pain and morbidity associated with open access, shorter operative times, and a reduction in the risk of infection. However, the confined working spaces and sensory deficit, due to a lack of haptic sensation, and proximity to critical vasculature and other vitally important anatomical structures bestow significant challenges on the surgeon. Recent advances in the field of surgical image guidance show promise in helping address these issues. This overview considers a number of important recent developments, all of which exploit imaging technologies that, to a lesser or greater extent, are integrated with the surgical robot platform. In its most advanced form, this combination of technologies results in a fusion of visual information such that the operative field is combined with navigational cues and representations of key anatomical structures through augmented reality registration and overlay. In terms of registration accuracy, image guidance as applied to TORS procedures is an exciting proposition, since the regions of interest (e.g., the tongue base, oropharynx) are typically adjacent to and enclosed by rigid anatomy. Clinical indications and overall effectiveness are discussed together with the limitations of the current technologies. Where appropriate, directions for future work are identified.",0
78,Anterior prostate fat resection during prostatectomy: a histopathologic review,"A common practice during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is to dissect the anterior prostate space and send this anterior fat sample for histological analysis to assess for the presence of any malignant tissue. Theoretically, this may help with prognostication and oncological control, however, is this a futile process? To determine the incidence of malignant tissue found in the anterior prostate (APF) samples sent for histological review. All RARP patients within a single urology centre over a 2-year period were included. The pathology results of these patients were reviewed and the proportion of patients with APF sent were analysed for presence of lymph nodes and malignant tissue. 657 patients were identified. 358 patients had APF samples reviewed by the histopathologists. 38 (10.6%) samples had lymph nodes identified within the sample. Malignant lymph node tissue was found in one patient (0.3%). Given the yield of malignancy found in APF samples is so small and the financial and time burden on pathology services, this process is not worthwhile.",1
79,Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy vs laparoscopic and open retropubic radical prostatectomy: functional outcomes 18 months after diagnosis from a national cohort study in England,"Background:
        
      
      Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been rapidly adopted without robust evidence comparing its functional outcomes against laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) or open retropubic radical prostatectomy (ORP) approaches. This study compared patient-reported functional outcomes following RARP, LRP or ORP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All men diagnosed with prostate cancer in England during April - October 2014 who underwent radical prostatectomy were identified from the National Prostate Cancer Audit and mailed a questionnaire 18 months after diagnosis. Group differences in patient-reported sexual, urinary, bowel and hormonal function (EPIC-26 domain scores) and generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EQ-5D-5L scores), with adjustment for patient and tumour characteristics, were estimated using linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all, 2219 men (77.0%) responded; 1310 (59.0%) had RARP, 487 (21.9%) LRP and 422 (19.0%) ORP. RARP was associated with slightly higher adjusted mean EPIC-26 sexual function scores compared with LRP (3·5 point difference; 95% CI: 1.1-5.9, P=0.004) or ORP (4.0 point difference; 95% CI: 1.5-6.5, P=0.002), which did not meet the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference (10-12 points). There were no significant differences in other EPIC-26 domain scores or HRQoL.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is unlikely that the rapid adoption of RARP in the English NHS has produced substantial improvements in functional outcomes for patients.",2
80,Supported progressive resistance exercise training to counter the adverse side effects of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a randomised controlled trial,"Purpose:
        
      
      To investigate the effects of a supported home-based progressive resistance exercise training (RET) programme on indices of cardiovascular health, muscular strength and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients after treatment with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was a single-site, two-arm randomised controlled trial, with 40 participants randomised to either the intervention or control group over a 10-month period. In addition to receiving usual care, the intervention group completed three weekly RET sessions using resistance bands for 6 months. Participants performed 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions for each exercise, targeting each major muscle group. The control group received usual care only. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was the primary outcome and assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included body weight, body fat, aerobic fitness, strength and blood-borne biomarkers associated with cardiometabolic risk.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was no significant difference between the groups in FMD at 3 or 6 months. However, there were improvements in aerobic exercise capacity (P < 0.01) and upper- (P < 0.01) and lower-limb (P = 0.01) strength in favour of the RET group at 6 months, accompanied by greater weight loss (P = 0.04) and a reduction in body fat (P = 0.02). Improvements in HRQoL were evident in the RET group at 3 and 6 months via the PCa-specific component of the FACT-P questionnaire (both P < 0.01). Five adverse events and one serious adverse event were reported throughout the trial duration.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrates that home-based RET is an effective and safe mode of exercise that elicits beneficial effects on aerobic exercise capacity, muscular strength and HR-QoL in men who have undergone RARP.

81,The Miami International Evidence-based Guidelines on Minimally Invasive Pancreas Resection,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to develop and externally validate the first evidence-based guidelines on minimally invasive pancreas resection (MIPR) before and during the International Evidence-based Guidelines on Minimally Invasive Pancreas Resection (IG-MIPR) meeting in Miami (March 2019).
    


          Summary background data:
        
      
      MIPR has seen rapid development in the past decade. Promising outcomes have been reported by early adopters from high-volume centers. Subsequently, multicenter series as well as randomized controlled trials were reported; however, guidelines for clinical practice were lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Scottisch Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology was used, incorporating these 4 items: systematic reviews using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to answer clinical questions, whenever possible in PICO style, the GRADE approach for assessment of the quality of evidence, the Delphi method for establishing consensus on the developed recommendations, and the AGREE-II instrument for the assessment of guideline quality and external validation. The current guidelines are cosponsored by the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, the Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, the Asian-Pacific Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, the European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, Pancreas Club, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgery, the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract, and the Society of Surgical Oncology.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After screening 16,069 titles, 694 studies were reviewed, and 291 were included. The final 28 recommendations covered 6 topics; laparoscopic and robotic distal pancreatectomy, central pancreatectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, as well as patient selection, training, learning curve, and minimal annual center volume required to obtain optimal outcomes and patient safety.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The IG-MIPR using SIGN methodology give guidance to surgeons, hospital administrators, patients, and medical societies on the use and outcome of MIPR as well as the approach to be taken regarding this challenging type of surgery.",3
82,Performance Analysis of Localization Algorithms for Inspections in 2D and 3D Unstructured Environments Using 3D Laser Sensors and UAVs,"One of the most relevant problems related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's (UAV) autonomous navigation for industrial inspection is localization or pose estimation relative to significant elements of the environment. This paper analyzes two different approaches in this regard, focusing on its application to unstructured scenarios where objects of considerable size are present, such as a truck, a wind tower, an airplane, a building, etc. The presented methods require a previously developed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the main object to be inspected. The first approach is based on an occupancy map built from a horizontal projection of this CAD model and the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm to reach convergence by considering the likelihood field observation model between the 2D projection of 3D sensor data and the created map. The second approach uses a point cloud prior map of the 3D CAD model and a scan-matching algorithm based on the Iterative Closest Point Algorithm (ICP) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The presented approaches have been extensively evaluated using simulated as well as previously recorded real flight data. We focus on aircraft inspection as a test example, but our results and conclusions can be directly extended to other applications. To support this assertion, a truck inspection has been performed. Our tests reflected that creating a 2D or 3D map from a standard CAD model and using a 3D laser scan on the created maps can optimize the processing time, resources and improve robustness. The techniques used to segment unexpected objects in 2D maps improved the performance of AMCL. In addition, we showed that moving around locations with relevant geometry after take-off when running AMCL enabled faster convergence and high accuracy. Hence, it could be used as an initial position estimation method for other localization algorithms. The ICP-NL method works well in environments with elements other than the object to inspect, but it can provide better results if some techniques to segment the new objects are applied. Furthermore, the proposed ICP-NL scan-matching method together with UKF performed faster, in a more robust manner, than NDT. Moreover, it is not affected by flight height. However, ICP-NL error may still be too high for applications requiring increased accuracy.",0
83,Fast and Low-GPU-memory abdomen CT organ segmentation: The FLARE challenge,"Automatic segmentation of abdominal organs in CT scans plays an important role in clinical practice. However, most existing benchmarks and datasets only focus on segmentation accuracy, while the model efficiency and its accuracy on the testing cases from different medical centers have not been evaluated. To comprehensively benchmark abdominal organ segmentation methods, we organized the first Fast and Low GPU memory Abdominal oRgan sEgmentation (FLARE) challenge, where the segmentation methods were encouraged to achieve high accuracy on the testing cases from different medical centers, fast inference speed, and low GPU memory consumption, simultaneously. The winning method surpassed the existing state-of-the-art method, achieving a 19× faster inference speed and reducing the GPU memory consumption by 60% with comparable accuracy. We provide a summary of the top methods, make their code and Docker containers publicly available, and give practical suggestions on building accurate and efficient abdominal organ segmentation models. The FLARE challenge remains open for future submissions through a live platform for benchmarking further methodology developments at https://flare.grand-challenge.org/.",0
84,Novel Liquid Biomarkers and Innovative Imaging for Kidney Cancer Diagnosis: What Can Be Implemented in Our Practice Today? A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Context:
        
      
      The epidemiological signature of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) during the past decades is explained by overdetection and overtreatment of indolent cancers; furthermore, a non-negligible proportion of patients undergoing surgery for suspected RCC harbour benign renal tumours. As the gold standard for RCC diagnosis remains histopathological analysis of surgical or biopsy specimens, implementation of noninvasive diagnostic strategies to discriminate between benign and malignant renal masses is an urgent unmet need.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review novel liquid biomarkers and imaging modalities for RCC diagnosis.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A systematic review of the recent English-language literature was conducted according to the European Association of Urology guidelines and the PRISMA statement recommendations (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020190773) using the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Risk-of-bias assessment was performed according to the QUADAS 2 tool.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      Overall, 15 studies (six on biomarkers and nine on imaging) and eight clinical trials were included. None of the biomarkers or imaging modalities has been validated or shown to have a distinct clinical value for RCC. Specific combinations of urinary cell-free and exosomal miRNAs, urinary miR-15a, and specific panels of urinary metabolites assessed by metabolomics appear promising. In addition, machine/deep learning algorithms and radiomics applied to cross-sectional images may have potential to improve RCC diagnosis. Most studies are limited by the retrospective design, size, and lack of external validation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Liquid biomarkers or imaging modalities are not ready for integration in the clinic and further well-designed studies must validate preliminary findings and explore utility in clinical decision-making.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available biomarkers (measured in blood or urine) and novel imaging tests (other than conventional imaging) to discriminate kidney cancer from benign renal masses in a noninvasive fashion. None of the biomarkers or imaging modalities studied was validated or added clinical value; therefore, none of them can be implemented in the clinic. However, these approaches appear to be promising for improving the diagnosis of kidney cancer in the future.",0
85,Integration of cardiovascular risk assessment with COVID-19 using artificial intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), in general, refers to the machines (or computers) that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that we associate with our mind, such as ""learning"" and ""solving problem"". New biomarkers derived from medical imaging are being discovered and are then fused with non-imaging biomarkers (such as office, laboratory, physiological, genetic, epidemiological, and clinical-based biomarkers) in a big data framework, to develop AI systems. These systems can support risk prediction and monitoring. This perspective narrative shows the powerful methods of AI for tracking cardiovascular risks. We conclude that AI could potentially become an integral part of the COVID-19 disease management system. Countries, large and small, should join hands with the WHO in building biobanks for scientists around the world to build AI-based platforms for tracking the cardiovascular risk assessment during COVID-19 times and long-term follow-up of the survivors.",0
86,"ESMO Consensus Conference on testicular germ cell cancer: diagnosis, treatment and follow-up","The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) consensus conference on testicular cancer was held on 3-5 November 2016 in Paris, France. The conference included a multidisciplinary panel of 36 leading experts in the diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer (34 panel members attended the conference; an additional two panel members [CB and K-PD] participated in all preparatory work and subsequent manuscript development). The aim of the conference was to develop detailed recommendations on topics relating to testicular cancer that are not covered in detail in the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) and where the available level of evidence is insufficient. The main topics identified for discussion related to: (1) diagnostic work-up and patient assessment; (2) stage I disease; (3) stage II-III disease; (4) post-chemotherapy surgery, salvage chemotherapy, salvage and desperation surgery and special topics; and (5) survivorship and follow-up schemes. The experts addressed questions relating to one of the five topics within five working groups. Relevant scientific literature was reviewed in advance. Recommendations were developed by the working groups and then presented to the entire panel. A consensus vote was obtained following whole-panel discussions, and the consensus recommendations were then further developed in post-meeting discussions in written form. This manuscript presents the results of the expert panel discussions, including the consensus recommendations and a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation. All participants approved the final manuscript.",0
87,Core outcome measures for clinical effectiveness trials of nutritional and metabolic interventions in critical illness: an international modified Delphi consensus study evaluation (CONCISE),"Background:
        
      
      Clinical research on nutritional and metabolic interventions in critically ill patients is heterogenous regarding time points, outcomes and measurement instruments used, impeding intervention development and data syntheses, and ultimately worsening clinical outcomes. We aimed to identify and develop a set of core outcome domains and associated measurement instruments to include in all research in critically ill patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An updated systematic review informed a two-stage modified Delphi consensus process (domains followed by instruments). Measurement instruments for domains considered 'essential' were taken through the second stage of the Delphi and a subsequent consensus meeting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 213 participants (41 patients/caregivers, 50 clinical researchers and 122 healthcare professionals) from 24 countries contributed. Consensus was reached on time points (30 and 90 days post-randomisation). Three domains were considered 'essential' at 30 days (survival, physical function and Infection) and five at 90 days (survival, physical function, activities of daily living, nutritional status and muscle/nerve function). Core 'essential' measurement instruments reached consensus for survival and activities of daily living, and 'recommended' measurement instruments for physical function, nutritional status and muscle/nerve function. No consensus was reached for a measurement instrument for Infection. Four further domains met criteria for 'recommended,' but not 'essential,' to measure at 30 days post-randomisation (organ dysfunction, muscle/nerve function, nutritional status and wound healing) and three at 90 days (frailty, body composition and organ dysfunction).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The CONCISE core outcome set is an internationally agreed minimum set of outcomes for use at 30 and 90 days post-randomisation, in nutritional and metabolic clinical research in critically ill adults.",1
88,"Combined effects of robot‑assisted gait training and botulinum toxin type A on spastic equinus foot in patients with chronic stroke: a pilot, single blind, randomized controlled trial","Background:
        
      
      Despite the growing evidence about the use of robotic gait training in neurorehabilitation, there is a scant literature about the combined effects of this innovative technological approach and a first‑line treatment for focal spasticity as botulinum toxin type A. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study evaluated if robotic gait training may enhance the antispastic effect of botulinum toxin type A.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To evaluate the combined effects of robot‑assisted gait training and botulinum toxin type A on spastic equinus foot in patients with chronic stroke.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Pilot, single blind, randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      University hospital.
    


          Population:
        
      
      Twenty‑two adult outpatients with spastic equinus due to chronic stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: patients allocated to the group 1 received robot‑assisted gait training (30 minutes a day for five consecutive days) after AbobotulinumtoxinA injection into the spastic calf muscles as well as patients allocated to the group 2 were only injected with AbobotulinumtoxinA into the same muscles. All patients were evaluated immediately before and one month after injection. The following outcome measures were considered: the modified Ashworth scale, the Tardieu scale and the 6-minute walking test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No difference was found between groups as to the modified Ashworth scale and the Tardieu scale measured at the affected ankle one month after botulinum toxin injection. A significant difference in the 6-minute walking test was noted between groups at the post‑treatment evaluation (P=0.045).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that robot‑assisted gait training does not enhance the effect of botulinum toxin type A on spastic equinus foot in patients with chronic stroke.
    


          Clinical rehabilitation impact:
        
      
      Our observations should be taken into account in daily clinical rehabilitation practice in order to develop effective treatment protocols based on the enhancement of antispastic drugs effect.",2
89,Improving efficiency in robotic theatres in the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust: a gynaecology theatres perspective,"Improving efficiency within the operating theatre is always a key concern when running a successful operating list. However, with robotic surgery, this can become paramount. Robotic procedures require a more technical set up, additional planning, and good solid communication within the multidisciplinary team. Efficiency needs to be at the forefront of everyone's mind. Forward planning requires knowledge of the procedures being carried out and adequate training with the robot. Trouble shooting will also improve efficiency in robotic surgery, as being able to expect the unexpected can be a major advantage. This article looks at the hurdles encountered by the theatre team at Royal Wolverhampton Trust at the implementation of the robotic programme, and how the theatre team made adjustments to working practice in order to minimise disruption and maximise efficiency.",3
90,Learning intraoperative organ manipulation with context-based reinforcement learning,"Purpose:
        
      
      Automation of sub-tasks during robotic surgery is challenging due to the high variability of the surgical scenes intra- and inter-patients. For example, the pick and place task can be executed different times during the same operation and for distinct purposes. Hence, designing automation solutions that can generalise a skill over different contexts becomes hard. All the experiments are conducted using the Pneumatic Attachable Flexible (PAF) rail, a novel surgical tool designed for robotic-assisted intraoperative organ manipulation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We build upon previous open-source surgical Reinforcement Learning (RL) training environment to develop a new RL framework for manipulation skills, rlman. In rlman, contextual RL agents are trained to solve different aspects of the pick and place task using the PAF rail system. rlman is implemented to support both low- and high-dimensional state information to solve surgical sub-tasks in a simulation environment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We use rlman to train state of the art RL agents to solve four different surgical sub-tasks involving manipulation skills using the PAF rail. We compare the results with state-of-the-art benchmarks found in the literature. We evaluate the ability of the agent to be able to generalise over different aspects of the targeted surgical environment.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We have shown that the rlman framework can support the training of different RL algorithms for solving surgical sub-task, analysing the importance of context information for generalisation capabilities. We are aiming to deploy the trained policy on the real da Vinci using the dVRK and show that the generalisation of the trained policy can be transferred to the real world.",4
91,Erectile function post robotic radical prostatectomy: technical tips to improve outcomes?,"Robotic surgery is becoming more and more commonplace. At the same time, so are complications, especially related to erectile function. The population being diagnosed with cancer is younger, with more aggressive cancers and higher expectations for good erectile function postoperatively. We conduct a retrospective analysis of literature over 20 years for Embase and Medline. Search terms used include (Robotic) AND (prostatectomy) AND (erectile function). There are a variety of multifactorial causes, resulting in worsening ED post-robotic radical prostatectomy; however, there are a number of treatments that can support this. There is much we can do to help prevent patients getting postoperative erectile dysfunction post-radical surgery. However, part of this is management of realistic patient expectations.",2
92,National cohort study comparing severe medium-term urinary complications after robot-assisted vs laparoscopic vs retropubic open radical prostatectomy,"Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate the occurrence of severe urinary complications within 2 years of surgery in men undergoing either robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) or retropubic open radical prostatectomy (ORP).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We conducted a population-based cohort study in men who underwent RARP (n = 4 947), LRP (n = 5 479) or ORP (n = 6 873) between 2008 and 2012 in the English National Health Service (NHS) using national cancer registry records linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics, an administrative database of admissions to NHS hospitals. We identified the occurrence of any severe urinary or severe stricture-related complication within 2 years of surgery using a validated tool. Multi-level regression modelling was used to determine the association between the type of surgery and occurrence of complications, with adjustment for patient and surgical factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Men undergoing RARP were least likely to experience any urinary complication (10.5%) or a stricture-related complication (3.3%) compared with those who had LRP (15.8% any or 5.7% stricture-related) or ORP (19.1% any or 6.9% stricture-related). The impact of the type of surgery on the occurrence of any urinary or stricture-related complications remained statistically significant after adjustment for patient and surgical factors (P < 0.01).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Men who underwent RARP had the lowest risk of developing severe urinary complications within 2 years of surgery.",5
93,Surgical and Minimally Invasive Therapies for the Management of the Small Renal Mass,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      This article aims to summarise recent developments in surgical and minimally invasive therapies in the management of small renal masses (SRMs).
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      The incidence of the small renal mass is increasing. Standard management of the SRM is partial nephrectomy. More recently, use of ablative techniques to manage the SRM has been increasing and an exciting array of technical advances is currently being made in the field. Nephron-sparing surgery looks set to become more financially viable with the advent of newer robotic platforms and, potentially, even less invasive with the evaluation of single-port access. Real-time imaging promises to improve tumour definition, nephron preservation and vascular management intraoperatively. Advances in surgical and minimally invasive therapies for the management of the SRM have the potential to improve cancer clearance and long-term renal function preservation. Patients will experience safer, more reliable and less invasive treatments for their small renal tumours. We describe the current advances underlying these changes.",1
94,Utilising the Delphi Process to Develop a Proficiency-based Progression Train-the-trainer Course for Robotic Surgery Training,"Context:
        
      
      As the role of robot-assisted surgery continues to expand, development of standardised and validated training programmes is becoming increasingly important.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To provide guidance on an optimised ""train-the-trainer"" (TTT) structured educational programme for surgical trainers, in which delegates learn a standardised approach to training candidates in skill acquisition. We aim to describe a TTT course for robotic surgery based on the current published literature and to define the key elements within a TTT course by seeking consensus from an expert committee formed of key opinion leaders in training.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      The project was carried out in phases: a systematic review of the current evidence was conducted, a face-to-face meeting was held in Philadelphia, and then an initial survey was created based on the current literature and expert opinion and sent to the committee. Thirty-two experts in training, including clinicians, academics, and industry, contributed to the Delphi process. The Delphi process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as ≥80% agreement.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      There was 100% consensus that there was a need for a standardized TTT course in robotic surgery. A consensus was reached in multiple areas, including the following: (1) definitions and terminologies, (2) qualifications to attend, (3) course objectives, (4) precourse considerations, (5) requirement of e-learning, (6) theory and course content, and (7) measurement of outcomes and performance level verification. The resulting formulated curriculum showed good internal consistency among experts, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.90.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using the Delphi methodology, we achieved an international consensus among experts to develop and reach content validation for a standardised TTT curriculum for robotic surgery training. This defined content lays the foundation for developing a proficiency-based progression model for trainers in robotic surgery. This TTT curriculum will require further validation.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      As the role of robot-assisted surgery continues to expand, development of standardised and validated training programmes is becoming increasingly important. There is currently a lack of high-level evidence on how best to train trainers in robot-assisted surgery. We report a consensus view on a standardised ""train-the trainer"" curriculum focused on robotic surgery. It was formulated by training experts from the USA and Europe, combining current evidence for training with experts' knowledge of surgical training.",3
95,Short-term clinical outcomes of a European training programme for robotic colorectal surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Despite there being a considerable amount of published studies on robotic colorectal surgery (RCS) over the last few years, there is a lack of evidence regarding RCS training pathways. This study examines the short-term clinical outcomes of an international RCS training programme (the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgery-EARCS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive cases from 26 European colorectal units who conducted RCS between 2014 and 2018 were included in this study. The baseline characteristics and short-term outcomes of cases performed by EARCS delegates during training were analysed and compared with cases performed by EARCS graduates and proctors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data from 1130 RCS procedures were collected and classified into three cohort groups (323 training, 626 graduates and 181 proctors). The training cases conversion rate was 2.2% and R1 resection rate was 1.5%. The three groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics with the exception of malignant cases and rectal resections performed. With the exception of operative time, blood loss and hospital stay (training vs. graduate vs. proctor: operative time 302, 265, 255 min, p < 0.001; blood loss 50, 50, 30 ml, p < 0.001; hospital stay 7, 6, 6 days, p = 0.003), all remaining short-term outcomes (conversion, 30-day reoperation, 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, clinical anastomotic leak, complications, R1 resection and lymph node yield) were comparable between the three groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Colorectal surgeons learning how to perform RCS under the EARCS-structured training pathway can safely achieve short-term clinical outcomes comparable to their trainers and overcome the learning process in a way that minimises patient harm.",3
96,Engineering microrobots for targeted cancer therapies from a medical perspective,"Systemic chemotherapy remains the backbone of many cancer treatments. Due to its untargeted nature and the severe side effects it can cause, numerous nanomedicine approaches have been developed to overcome these issues. However, targeted delivery of therapeutics remains challenging. Engineering microrobots is increasingly receiving attention in this regard. Their functionalities, particularly their motility, allow microrobots to penetrate tissues and reach cancers more efficiently. Here, we highlight how different microrobots, ranging from tailor-made motile bacteria and tiny bubble-propelled microengines to hybrid spermbots, can be engineered to integrate sophisticated features optimised for precision-targeting of a wide range of cancers. Towards this, we highlight the importance of integrating clinicians, the public and cancer patients early on in the development of these novel technologies.",0
97,Robot-assisted uterine artery embolization: a first-in-woman safety evaluation of the Magellan System,"Purpose:
        
      
      To provide a technical description of robot-assisted uterine artery embolization and to investigate the safety and feasibility of the Magellan (Hansen Medical, Mountain View, California, USA) robotic catheter in this complex arterial bed.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Five women (mean age, 48.8 y) underwent robot-assisted bilateral uterine artery embolization over a 10-month period using the Magellan robotic catheter. Demographic, clinicopathologic, and endovascular performance metric data (fluoroscopy and cannulation times) were recorded as well as short-term outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Robotic cannulation of bilateral internal iliac and uterine arteries was successful in all cases. Median right and left internal iliac artery cannulation and total fluoroscopy times were 3 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 1.5-4 min), 2 minutes (IQR, 1.5-4 min), and 11 minutes (IQR, 9.5-14 min). Median right and left uterine artery cannulation times were both 11 minutes (IQR, 6.5-15 min and 8-12 min, respectively). Technical success was 100%. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 1, and there were no major or access site complications. At 6 months after the procedure, all patients reported significant improvement of symptoms, with a median increase in health-related quality-of-life score of 58% (48.5%-61.75%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of the new-generation Magellan system in uterine artery embolization is feasible and appears to be safe. The additional navigational capability and added maneuverability of the NorthStar catheter (Hansen Medical, Mountain View, California) may facilitate selective catheterization of small iliac artery divisions and may be useful in any procedure where complex arterial selection is needed.",2
98,Navigating a social world with robot partners: A quantitative cartography of the Uncanny Valley,"Android robots are entering human social life. However, human-robot interactions may be complicated by a hypothetical Uncanny Valley (UV) in which imperfect human-likeness provokes dislike. Previous investigations using unnaturally blended images reported inconsistent UV effects. We demonstrate an UV in subjects' explicit ratings of likability for a large, objectively chosen sample of 80 real-world robot faces and a complementary controlled set of edited faces. An ""investment game"" showed that the UV penetrated even more deeply to influence subjects' implicit decisions concerning robots' social trustworthiness, and that these fundamental social decisions depend on subtle cues of facial expression that are also used to judge humans. Preliminary evidence suggests category confusion may occur in the UV but does not mediate the likability effect. These findings suggest that while classic elements of human social psychology govern human-robot social interaction, robust UV effects pose a formidable android-specific problem.",4
99,Boosting robot-assisted rehabilitation of stroke hemiparesis by individualized selection of upper limb movements - a pilot study,"Background:
        
      
      Intensive robot-assisted training of the upper limb after stroke can reduce motor impairment, even at the chronic stage. However, the effectiveness of practice for recovery depends on the selection of the practised movements. We hypothesized that rehabilitation can be optimized by selecting the movements to be practiced based on the trainee's performance profile.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We present a novel principle ('steepest gradients') for performance-based selection of movements. The principle is based on mapping motor performance across a workspace and then selecting movements located at regions of the steepest transition between better and worse performance. To assess the benefit of this principle we compared the effect of 15 sessions of robot-assisted reaching training on upper-limb motor impairment, between two groups of people who have moderate-to-severe chronic upper-limb hemiparesis due to stroke. The test group (N = 7) received steepest gradients-based training, iteratively selected according to the steepest gradients principle with weekly remapping, whereas the control group (N = 9) received a standard ""centre-out"" reaching training. Training intensity was identical.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Both groups showed improvement in Fugl-Meyer upper-extremity scores (the primary outcome measure). Moreover, the test group showed significantly greater improvement (twofold) compared to control. The score remained elevated, on average, for at least 4 weeks although the additional benefit of the steepest-gradients -based training diminished relative to control.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study provides a proof of concept for the superior benefit of performance-based selection of practiced movements in reducing upper-limb motor impairment due to stroke. This added benefit was most evident in the short term, suggesting that performance-based steepest-gradients training may be effective in increasing the rate of initial phase of practice-based recovery; we discuss how long-term retention may also be improved.

100,Omitting Cortical Renorrhaphy in Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy: Is it Safe? A Single Center Large Case Series,"Introduction: Preserving renal function after robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) is important and influenced by the technique of renal reconstruction among other parameters, including ischemia time and amount of healthy renal tissue resected. It is believed that reconstruction with a second layer of cortical renorrhaphy is necessary to prevent urinary leaks and postoperative bleeding, but this is associated with the potential loss of healthy renal parenchyma and may result in worse outcomes postoperatively. Purpose: To assess the safety of omitting cortical renorrhaphy during RAPN. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 146 consecutive patients undergoing a RAPN with single or double layer renorrhaphy at the Wirral University Teaching Hospital from 2014 to 2019. Data obtained included: Patient demographics, tumor RENAL nephrometry, Perioperative parameters; blood loss, duration, and warm ischemia time (WIT), Postop complications, change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (pre and 3 months postop), length of stay, and oncologic outcomes. Results: In total 146 patients were identified. One hundred-six had double renorrhaphy and 40 inner layer only renorrhaphy. No significant differences were seen between these two cohorts in terms of patient demographics, RENAL nephrometry score, tumor size, or location. Perioperative parameters showed a reduced duration of surgery in the single renorrhaphy group with a mean of 125 minutes compared to143 minutes in the double renorrhaphy (p = 0.006) and a tendency toward a shorter WIT of 12.9 minutes vs 14.0 minutes reaching borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05) but no difference in blood loss volume (p = 0.25). Postoperatively there was no statistical difference in the length of hospital stay (p = 0.85), loss in eGFR at 3 months (0.06), or complication (p = 0.56). After a median follow-up of 35 months no recurrences or deaths were observed in either group. Conclusions: Omission of cortical renorrhaphy appears feasible and safe with no urine leaks or excess complications observed.",6

102,Emerging robotic platforms for minimally invasive surgery,"Recent technological advances in surgery have resulted in the development of a range of new techniques that have reduced patient trauma, shortened hospitalization, and improved diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcome. Despite the many appreciated benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) compared to traditional approaches, there are still significant drawbacks associated with conventional MIS including poor instrument control and ergonomics caused by rigid instrumentation and its associated fulcrum effect. The use of robot assistance has helped to realize the full potential of MIS with improved consistency, safety and accuracy. The development of articulated, precision tools to enhance the surgeon's dexterity has evolved in parallel with advances in imaging and human-robot interaction. This has improved hand-eye coordination and manual precision down to micron scales, with the capability of navigating through complex anatomical pathways. In this review paper, clinical requirements and technical challenges related to the design of robotic platforms for flexible access surgery are discussed. Allied technical approaches and engineering challenges related to instrument design, intraoperative guidance, and intelligent human-robot interaction are reviewed. We also highlight emerging designs and research opportunities in the field by assessing the current limitations and open technical challenges for the wider clinical uptake of robotic platforms in MIS.",1
103,Let's Work Together: A Meta-Analysis on Robot Design Features That Enable Successful Human-Robot Interaction at Work,"Objective:
        
      
      This meta-analysis reviews robot design features of interface, controller, and appearance and statistically summarizes their effect on successful human-robot interaction (HRI) at work (that is, task performance, cooperation, satisfaction, acceptance, trust, mental workload, and situation awareness).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Robots are becoming an integral part of many workplaces. As interactions with employees increase, ensuring success becomes ever more vital. Even though many studies investigated robot design features, an overview on general and specific effects is missing.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Systematic selection of literature and structured coding led to 81 included experimental studies containing 380 effect sizes. Mean effects were calculated using a three-level meta-analysis to handle dependencies of multiple effect sizes in one study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sufficient feedback through the interface, clear visibility of affordances, and adaptability and autonomy of the controller significantly affect successful HRI, whereas appearance does not. The features of the interface and controller affect performance and satisfaction but do not affect situation awareness and trust. Specific effects of adaptability on cooperation and acceptance, as well as autonomy on mental workload, could be shown.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robot design at work needs to cover multiple features of interface and controller to achieve successful HRI that covers not only performance and satisfaction, but also cooperation, acceptance, and mental workload. More empirical research is needed to investigate mediating mechanisms and underrepresented design features' effects.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Robot designers should carefully choose design features to balance specific effects and implementation costs with regard to tasks, work design aims, and employee needs in the specific work context.",4
104,"Role of Deep Learning in Prostate Cancer Management: Past, Present and Future Based on a Comprehensive Literature Review","This review aims to present the applications of deep learning (DL) in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Computer vision is becoming an increasingly large part of our daily lives due to advancements in technology. These advancements in computational power have allowed more extensive and more complex DL models to be trained on large datasets. Urologists have found these technologies help them in their work, and many such models have been developed to aid in the identification, treatment and surgical practices in prostate cancer. This review will present a systematic outline and summary of these deep learning models and technologies used for prostate cancer management. A literature search was carried out for English language articles over the last two decades from 2000-2021, and present in Scopus, MEDLINE, Clinicaltrials.gov, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar. A total of 224 articles were identified on the initial search. After screening, 64 articles were identified as related to applications in urology, from which 24 articles were identified to be solely related to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The constant improvement in DL models should drive more research focusing on deep learning applications. The focus should be on improving models to the stage where they are ready to be implemented in clinical practice. Future research should prioritize developing models that can train on encrypted images, allowing increased data sharing and accessibility.",0
105,Identification of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation patients using a machine learning risk prediction algorithm and diagnostic testing (PULsE-AI): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke, enhanced stroke severity, and other comorbidities. However, AF is often asymptomatic, and frequently remains undiagnosed until complications occur. Current screening approaches for AF lack either cost-effectiveness or diagnostic sensitivity; thus, there is interest in tools that could be used for population screening. An AF risk prediction algorithm, developed using machine learning from a UK dataset of 2,994,837 patients, was found to be more effective than existing models at identifying patients at risk of AF. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of this risk prediction algorithm combined with diagnostic testing for the identification of AF in a real-world primary care setting. Eligible participants (aged ≥30 years and without an existing AF diagnosis) registered at participating UK general practices will be randomised into intervention and control arms. Intervention arm participants identified at highest risk of developing AF (algorithm risk score ≥ 7.4%) will be invited for a 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) followed by two-weeks of home-based ECG monitoring with a KardiaMobile device. Control arm participants will be used for comparison and will be managed routinely. The primary outcome is the number of AF diagnoses in the intervention arm compared with the control arm during the research window. If the trial is successful, there is potential for the risk prediction algorithm to be implemented throughout primary care for narrowing the population considered at highest risk for AF who could benefit from more intensive screening for AF.

106,The impact of PRODIGE 7 on the current worldwide practice of CRS-HIPEC for colorectal peritoneal metastases: A web-based survey and 2021 statement by Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI),"Introduction:
        
      
      The PRODIGE 7-trial investigated the additional value of Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) to cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM). The results of PRODIGE 7 were presented at the 2018 ASCO meeting showing that 30 min oxaliplatin-based HIPEC did not improve overall survival. The current study investigated the impact of PRODIGE 7 on the worldwide practice of CRS and HIPEC.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      CRS-HIPEC experts from 19 countries were invited through the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International (PSOGI) to complete an online survey concerning the current CRS-HIPEC practice in their hospital and country, and were asked to appraise the effect of PRODIGE 7.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survey was completed by 18/19 experts. Although their personal opinions of CRS-HIPEC were barely influenced by PRODIGE 7, they reported a substantial impact on daily practice. This included a switch towards Mitomycin-C based HIPEC-regimens and prolongation of HIPEC perfusion time, a reduction in the number of referrals from non-HIPEC centers, a reduction in national consensus, the removal of HIPEC from national guidelines, and a reduced reimbursement rate.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The PRODIGE 7 has had a major impact on the practice of CRS-HIPEC for CPM worldwide. HIPEC remains an attractive option with potential for control and eradication of disease and further studies into the optimal HIPEC-regimen are urgently needed. Meanwhile, given the complexity of the treatment of patients with CPM, and the proven benefits of optimal CRS, referral of patients with potentially resectable CPM to expert centers is recommended whilst the precise role of HIPEC is further evaluated.",3

108,A novel flexible hyper-redundant surgical robot: prototype evaluation using a single incision flexible access pelvic application as a clinical exemplar,"Introduction:
        
      
      The flexible endoscope is increasingly being considered as a surgical tool to enable innovative natural orifice or flexible access techniques. These experiences have exposed unique advantages but also significant challenges. Major current technical drawbacks in this setting relate to uncontrolled flexibility, inaccurate sustained target localization, unreliable navigation and overall platform instability. In striving to address existing technical limitations, this paper introduces a novel flexible hyper-redundant surgical robot and evaluates its clinical potential using a focused clinical application.
    


          Method:
        
      
      To assess utility of the device within tight confines of the human pelvis or peritoneal cavity, detailed laboratory workspace analysis experiments were undertaken using a computer-simulated model that incorporated anatomical data obtained via pelvic magnetic resonance images of eight women. Ten participants executed ninety usability and reliability trials on an ex vivo simulator, before the robot was repeatedly trialled in an in vivo porcine model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The robot demonstrated capability of targeting >90 % of the anatomic region of interest. All 90 user trials were successfully performed without interruption or malfunction. Significant improvements in performance, time and motion were observed between first and last sets of trials (p = 0.001). In vivo feasibility testing affirmed robustness of the device when deployed within the physiological demands of a live scale appropriate model.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Technologically advanced flexible operative platforms are needed to fulfil aspirations for an introductory era of flexible access surgery. This prototype is proposed as a potential future platform for robot-assisted flexible endoscopic surgery. Encouraging pre-clinical feasibility results are demonstrated for diagnostic and therapeutic applications within the pelvis.",1
109,2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy,"Bile duct injury (BDI) is a dangerous complication of cholecystectomy, with significant postoperative sequelae for the patient in terms of morbidity, mortality, and long-term quality of life. BDIs have an estimated incidence of 0.4-1.5%, but considering the number of cholecystectomies performed worldwide, mostly by laparoscopy, surgeons must be prepared to manage this surgical challenge. Most BDIs are recognized either during the procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. However, some BDIs may be discovered later during the postoperative period, and this may translate to delayed or inappropriate treatments. Providing a specific diagnosis and a precise description of the BDI will expedite the decision-making process and increase the chance of treatment success. Subsequently, the choice and timing of the appropriate reconstructive strategy have a critical role in long-term prognosis. Currently, a wide spectrum of multidisciplinary interventions with different degrees of invasiveness is indicated for BDI management. These World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines have been produced following an exhaustive review of the current literature and an international expert panel discussion with the aim of providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate and standardize the detection and management of BDIs during cholecystectomy. In particular, the 2020 WSES guidelines cover the following key aspects: (1) strategies to minimize the risk of BDI during cholecystectomy; (2) BDI rates in general surgery units and review of surgical practice; (3) how to classify, stage, and report BDI once detected; (4) how to manage an intraoperatively detected BDI; (5) indications for antibiotic treatment; (6) indications for clinical, biochemical, and imaging investigations for suspected BDI; and (7) how to manage a postoperatively detected BDI.",0
110,An Early Stage Researcher's Primer on Systems Medicine Terminology,"Background: Systems Medicine is a novel approach to medicine, that is, an interdisciplinary field that considers the human body as a system, composed of multiple parts and of complex relationships at multiple levels, and further integrated into an environment. Exploring Systems Medicine implies understanding and combining concepts coming from diametral different fields, including medicine, biology, statistics, modeling and simulation, and data science. Such heterogeneity leads to semantic issues, which may slow down implementation and fruitful interaction between these highly diverse fields. Methods: In this review, we collect and explain more than100 terms related to Systems Medicine. These include both modeling and data science terms and basic systems medicine terms, along with some synthetic definitions, examples of applications, and lists of relevant references. Results: This glossary aims at being a first aid kit for the Systems Medicine researcher facing an unfamiliar term, where he/she can get a first understanding of them, and, more importantly, examples and references for digging into the topic.",0
111,Evidence for Genetic Overlap Between Schizophrenia and Age at First Birth in Women,"Importance:
        
      
      A recently published study of national data by McGrath et al in 2014 showed increased risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) in offspring associated with both early and delayed parental age, consistent with a U-shaped relationship. However, it remains unclear if the risk to the child is due to psychosocial factors associated with parental age or if those at higher risk for SCZ tend to have children at an earlier or later age.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine if there is a genetic association between SCZ and age at first birth (AFB) using genetically informative but independently ascertained data sets.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This investigation used multiple independent genome-wide association study data sets. The SCZ sample comprised 18 957 SCZ cases and 22 673 controls in a genome-wide association study from the second phase of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and the AFB sample comprised 12 247 genotyped women measured for AFB from the following 4 community cohorts: Estonia (Estonian Genome Center Biobank, University of Tartu), the Netherlands (LifeLines Cohort Study), Sweden (Swedish Twin Registry), and the United Kingdom (TwinsUK). Schizophrenia genetic risk for each woman in the AFB community sample was estimated using genetic effects inferred from the SCZ genome-wide association study.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      We tested if SCZ genetic risk was a significant predictor of response variables based on published polynomial functions that described the relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring in Denmark. We substituted AFB for maternal age in these functions, one of which was corrected for the age of the father, and found that the fit was superior for the model without adjustment for the father's age.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We observed a U-shaped relationship between SCZ risk and AFB in the community cohorts, consistent with the previously reported relationship between SCZ risk in offspring and maternal age when not adjusted for the age of the father. We confirmed that SCZ risk profile scores significantly predicted the response variables (coefficient of determination R2 = 1.1E-03, P = 4.1E-04), reflecting the published relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring by McGrath et al in 2014.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      This study provides evidence for a significant overlap between genetic factors associated with risk of SCZ and genetic factors associated with AFB. It has been reported that SCZ risk associated with increased maternal age is explained by the age of the father and that de novo mutations that occur more frequently in the germline of older men are the underlying causal mechanism. This explanation may need to be revised if, as suggested herein and if replicated in future studies, there is also increased genetic risk of SCZ in older mothers.",5
112,The Relationship Between Trust and Use Choice in Human-Robot Interaction,"Objective:
        
      
      To understand the influence of trust on use choice in human-robot interaction via experimental investigation.
    


          Background:
        
      
      The general assumption that trusting a robot leads to using that robot has been previously identified, often by asking participants to choose between manually completing a task or using an automated aid. Our work further evaluates the relationship between trust and use choice and examines factors impacting choice.
    


          Method:
        
      
      An experiment was conducted wherein participants rated a robot on a trust scale, then made decisions about whether to use that robotic agent or a human agent to complete a task. Participants provided explicit reasoning for their choices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      While we found statistical support for the ""trust leads to use"" relationship, qualitative results indicate other factors are important as well.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Results indicated that while trust leads to use, use is also heavily influenced by the specific task at hand. Users more often chose a robot for a dangerous task where loss of life is likely, citing safety as their primary concern. Conversely, users chose humans for the mundane warehouse task, mainly citing financial reasons, specifically fear of job and income loss for the human worker.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Understanding the factors driving use choice is key to appropriate interaction in the field of human-robot teaming.",4
113,Role of intra-operative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery,"This review examines studies of intra-operative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and its emerging role and advantages in robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a technology that combines the use of second-generation contrast agents consisting of microbubbles with existent ultrasound techniques. Until now, this novel technology has aided surgeons with procedures involving the liver. However, with recent advances in the CEUS technique and the introduction of robotics in nephron-sparing surgery, CEUS has proven to be efficacious in answering several clinical questions with respect to the kidneys. In addition, the introduction of the microbubble-based contrast agents has increased the image quality and signal uptake by the ultrasound probe. This has led to better, enhanced scanning of the macro and microvasculature of the kidneys, making CEUS a powerful diagnostic modality. This imaging method is capable of further lowering the learning curve and warm ischemia time (WIT) during robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery, with its increased level of capillary perfusion and imaging. CEUS has the potential to increase the sensitivity and specificity of intra-operative images, and can significantly improve the outcome of robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery by increasing the precision and diagnostic insight of the surgeon. The purpose of this article is to review the practical and potential uses of CEUS as an intra-operative imaging technique during robotic-assisted nephron-sparing surgery.",1
114,Increased precision of coronal plane outcomes in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Inaccuracy of component alignment in total knee arthroplasty adversely impacts outcomes. Robotic systems improve translation of pre-operative planning to intra-operative steps, theoretically resulting in greater accuracy and precision. In this study we systematically review literature data of alignment outcomes and apply meta-analysis methods to assess whether robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty provides superior outcomes when compared to conventional knee prostheses.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A PRISMA compliant search comparing alignment outcomes in robotic vs conventional knee arthroplasty was performed. Primary outcome measures were; number of three degree outliers and mean deviation from a neutral post-operative mechanical axis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, from five studies reporting upon 402 knees, a post-operative mechanical axis malalignment of >3° occurred in 1/181 (0.006%) of robotic knees, and 42/159 (26.4%) of conventional knees with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.04 (95% CI 0.01-0.14), p < 0.00001 favouring robotic-assisted instrumentation. Meta-analysis also demonstrated weighted mean differences of post-operative mechanical axis alignment to be significantly more accurate in the robotic knee group: mean difference -0.63 (95% CI: -1.18,-0.08), z = 2.25, p = 0.02. Sensitivity analysis with inclusion of only Level 1 studies showed similar findings.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates clear evidence of increased accuracy of alignment in robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty with specific regard to reconstituting a neutral mechanical axis and minimising number of outliers in the coronal plane. Further studies and long term data is required in order to conclude on survivorship and functional outcomes.",1

116,Robotic hip joint testing: Development and experimental protocols,"The use of robotic systems combined with force sensing is emerging as the gold standard for in vitro biomechanical joint testing, due to the advantage of controlling all six degrees of freedom independently of one another. This paper describes a novel robotic platform and the experimental protocol used for hip joint testing. An experimental protocol implemented optical tracking and registration techniques in order to define the position of the hip joint centre of rotation (COR) in the coordinate system of the robot's end effector. The COR coordinates defined the origin of the task-related coordinate system used to control the robot, with a hybrid force/position law to simulate standard clinical tests. The axes of this frame were defined using the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) anatomical coordinate system. Experiments were carried out on two cadaveric hip joint specimens using the robotic testing platform and a mechanical testing rig previously developed and described by our group. Simulated internal-external and adduction/abduction laxity tests were carried out with both systems and the resulting peak range of motion (ROM) was measured. Similarities and differences were observed in these experiments, which were used to highlight some of the limitations of conventional systems and the corresponding advantages of robotics, further emphasising their added value in vitro testing.",3
117,Early surgical outcomes and oncological results of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: a multicentre study,"Objective:
        
      
      To describe a multicentre experience of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in northern England, with focus on early surgical outcomes and oncological results.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      All consecutive patients undergoing RAPN at four tertiary referral centres in northern England in the period 2012-2015 were included for analysis. RAPN was performed via a transperitoneal approach using a standardized technique. Prospective data collection was performed to capture preoperative characteristics (including R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score), and peri-operative and postoperative data, including renal function. Correlations between warm ischaemia time (WIT), positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, complication rates, R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores and learning curve were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 250 patients (mean age 58.1 ± 13 years, mean ± sd body mass index 27.3 ± 7 kg/m2 ) were included, with a median (range) follow-up of 12 (3-36) months. The mean ± sd tumour size was 30.6 ± 10 mm, mean R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score was 6.1 ± 2 and 55% of tumours were left-sided. Mean ± sd operating console time was 141 ± 38 min, WIT 16.7 ± 8 min and estimated blood loss 205 ± 145 mL. There were five conversions (2%) to open/radical nephrectomy. The overall complication rate was 16.4% (Clavien I, 1.6%; Clavien II, 8.8%; Clavien III, 6%; Clavien IV/V; 0%). Pathologically, 82.4% of tumours were malignant and the overall PSM rate was 7.3%. The mean ± sd preoperative and immediate postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates were 92.8 ± 27 and 80.8 ± 27 mL/min/1.73 m2 , respectively (P = 0.001). In all, 66% of patients remained in the same chronic kidney disease category postoperatively, and none of the patients required dialysis during the study period. 'Trifecta' (defined as WIT < 25 min, negative surgical margin status and no peri-operative complications) was achieved in 68.4% of patients overall, but improved with surgeon experience. PSM status and long WIT were significantly associated with early learning curve.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the largest multicentre RAPN study in the UK. Initial results show that RAPN is safe and can be performed with minimal morbidity. Early oncological outcomes and renal function preservation data are encouraging.",9
118,Reducing negative emotions in children using social robots: systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      For many children, visiting the hospital can lead to a state of increased anxiety. Social robots are being explored as a possible tool to reduce anxiety and distress in children attending a clinical or hospital environment. Social robots are designed to communicate and interact through movement, music and speech.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This systematic review aims at assessing the current evidence on the types of social robots used and their impact on children's anxiety or distress levels when visiting the hospital for outpatient appointments or planned admissions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PsychINFO and Google Scholar were queried for papers published between January 2009 and August 2020 reporting the use of social robots interacting with children in hospital or clinical environments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 10 studies were located and included. Across these 10 studies, 7 different types of robots were used. Anxiety and distress were found to be reduced in the children who interacted with a social robot.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, the evidence suggests that social robots hold a promising role in reducing levels of anxiety or distress in children visiting the hospital. However, research on social robots is at an early stage and requires further studies to strengthen the evidence base.",5
119,"Preclinical evaluation of Versius, an innovative device for use in robot-assisted thoracic surgery","Objectives:
        
      
      The adoption of robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) has helped to overcome some of the challenges associated with surgeons performing conventional video-assisted thoracic surgery. The Versius Surgical System (CMR Surgical, Cambridge, UK) has been developed iteratively in line with surgical team feedback to improve the surgeon's experience and patient outcomes. The goal of this study was to assess the use of the device in RATS in a preclinical setting and to fulfil Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-Term Follow Up-Devices stage 1 (Idea).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four cadaveric sessions were conducted between November 2018 and December 2020, during which device performance in a range of thoracic operations was assessed. Procedures were categorized as either completed or not completed, and surgeons evaluated the device's ability to successfully complete necessary surgical steps. Port and bedside unit positions were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 22/24 (91.7%) thoracic procedures were successfully completed, including 17/18 lobectomies, 2/3 thymectomies and 3/3 diaphragm plications, in 9 cadaver specimens. One thymectomy could not be completed due to cadaver anatomy and 1 lobectomy was not completed due a console system fault. Port and bedside unit configurations were successfully validated for all procedures, and lead surgeons deemed the device to be well-suited for thoracic surgery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This preclinical study demonstrated the successful use of the device in RATS in cadaveric models and supports progression to small-scale clinical studies, as part of Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-Term Follow Up-Devices stage 2a (Development).",1
120,Physiological parameters for Prognosis in Abdominal Sepsis (PIPAS) Study: a WSES observational study,"Background:
        
      
      Timing and adequacy of peritoneal source control are the most important pillars in the management of patients with acute peritonitis. Therefore, early prognostic evaluation of acute peritonitis is paramount to assess the severity and establish a prompt and appropriate treatment. The objectives of this study were to identify clinical and laboratory predictors for in-hospital mortality in patients with acute peritonitis and to develop a warning score system, based on easily recognizable and assessable variables, globally accepted.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This worldwide multicentre observational study included 153 surgical departments across 56 countries over a 4-month study period between February 1, 2018, and May 31, 2018.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3137 patients were included, with 1815 (57.9%) men and 1322 (42.1%) women, with a median age of 47 years (interquartile range [IQR] 28-66). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 8.9%, with a median length of stay of 6 days (IQR 4-10). Using multivariable logistic regression, independent variables associated with in-hospital mortality were identified: age > 80 years, malignancy, severe cardiovascular disease, severe chronic kidney disease, respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, AVPU responsiveness scale (voice and unresponsive), blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) < 90% in air, platelet count < 50,000 cells/mm3, and lactate > 4 mmol/l. These variables were used to create the PIPAS Severity Score, a bedside early warning score for patients with acute peritonitis. The overall mortality was 2.9% for patients who had scores of 0-1, 22.7% for those who had scores of 2-3, 46.8% for those who had scores of 4-5, and 86.7% for those who have scores of 7-8.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The simple PIPAS Severity Score can be used on a global level and can help clinicians to identify patients at high risk for treatment failure and mortality.",0
121,Robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy: the Verona experience,"Background:
        
      
      The minimally invasive approach in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy has currently been emphasized in benign and pre-malignant pancreatic diseases. The study aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of our technique of robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP) by a stepwise approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The data of consecutive patients presented for RSPDP from 2014 to 2019 at Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedure performed, such as Kimura's (KG) or Warshaw's (WG) technique, and then compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the study period, 32 patients underwent RSPDP. Twenty-three patients presented for the Kimura procedure (72%), while nine patients underwent the Warshaw procedure (28%). A higher body mass index was found in the KG (26 ± 4 vs. 22 ± 3, p = 0.037). Regarding the pathological data, the WG group differed in the tumor dimension, and the lymph nodes harvested (30 ± 2 vs. 17 ± 10, 9 ± 5 vs. 3 ± 4, p = 0.0028, and p = 0.005, respectively). Notably, no conversions and mortality were recorded. The overall morbidity was 25% ( eight patients) with no difference between the groups (p = 0.820). The mean length of stay was 8 days, and was similar between the groups (p = 0.350).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present study suggests that RSPDP is a valid option for the treatment of benign or pre-malignant pancreatic diseases of the distal pancreas, with comparable morbidity with the standard treatment and no mortality. Further research is needed to standardize the technique and to assess the immunological, surgical, and financial benefits of the procedure.",3
122,Investigating exploration for deep reinforcement learning of concentric tube robot control,"Purpose:
        
      
      Concentric tube robots are composed of multiple concentric, pre-curved, super-elastic, telescopic tubes that are compliant and have a small diameter suitable for interventions that must be minimally invasive like fetal surgery. Combinations of rotation and extension of the tubes can alter the robot's shape but the inverse kinematics are complex to model due to the challenge of incorporating friction and other tube interactions or manufacturing imperfections. We propose a model-free reinforcement learning approach to form the inverse kinematics solution and directly obtain a control policy.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Three exploration strategies are shown for deep deterministic policy gradient with hindsight experience replay for concentric tube robots in simulation environments. The aim is to overcome the joint to Cartesian sampling bias and be scalable with the number of robotic tubes. To compare strategies, evaluation of the trained policy network to selected Cartesian goals and associated errors are analyzed. The learned control policy is demonstrated with trajectory following tasks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Separation of extension and rotation joints for Gaussian exploration is required to overcome Cartesian sampling bias. Parameter noise and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck were found to be optimal strategies with less than 1 mm error in all simulation environments. Various trajectories can be followed with the optimal exploration strategy learned policy at high joint extension values. Our inverse kinematics solver in evaluation has 0.44 mm extension and [Formula: see text] rotation error.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We demonstrate the feasibility of effective model-free control for concentric tube robots. Directly using the control policy, arbitrary trajectories can be followed and this is an important step towards overcoming the challenge of concentric tube robot control for clinical use in minimally invasive interventions.",1
123,Robotic Parathyroid Surgery: Current Perspectives and Future Considerations,"Robotic parathyroidectomy represents a novel surgical approach in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism when the parathyroid adenoma has been pre-operatively localised. It represents the ""fourth generation"" in the evolution of parathyroid surgery following a process of surgical evolution from cervicotomy and 4-gland exploration to a variety of minimally invasive, open and endoscopic, targeted approaches. The existing evidence (levels 2-3) supports it as a feasible and safe technique with equivalent results to targeted open parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism in carefully selected patients. However, it takes longer to perform and is more costly than conventional parathyroidectomy. It offers superior cosmesis by completely avoiding a neck scar making it a valid option for those patients who for biological and/or cultural reasons may wish to avoid a neck scar. Robotic parathyroidectomy is not for every patient, surgeon, or hospital. Its application should be confined to high-volume centres and experienced surgeons. Intensive training and proctorship are required for its safe implementation combined with careful patient selection. This particularly relates to the patient's body habitus (BMI < 30 kg/m2) and concordance among the different imaging modalities used pre-operatively. With robotic market competition driving down costs, its role may change. For now, robotic parathyroidectomy occupies a niche role and can only be justified in a select subset of patients.",1
124,Public Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Medicine,"Objective: To understand better the public perception and comprehension of medical technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic surgery. In addition to this, to identify sensitivity to their use to ensure acceptability and quality of counseling. Subjects and Methods: A survey was conducted on a convenience sample of visitors to the MN Minnesota State Fair (n = 264). Participants were randomized to receive one of two similar surveys. In the first, a diagnosis was made by a physician and in the second by an AI application to compare confidence in human and computer-based diagnosis. Results: The median age of participants was 45 (interquartile range 28-59), 58% were female (n = 154) vs 42% male (n = 110), 69% had completed at least a bachelor's degree, 88% were Caucasian (n = 233) vs 12% ethnic minorities (n = 31) and were from 12 states, mostly from the Upper Midwest. Participants had nearly equal trust in AI vs physician diagnoses. However, they were significantly more likely to trust an AI diagnosis of cancer over a doctor's diagnosis when responding to the version of the survey that suggested that an AI could make medical diagnoses (p = 9.32e-06). Though 55% of respondents (n = 145) reported that they were uncomfortable with automated robotic surgery, the majority of the individuals surveyed (88%) mistakenly believed that partially autonomous surgery was already happening. Almost all (94%, n = 249) stated that they would be willing to pay for a review of medical imaging by an AI if available. Conclusion: Most participants express confidence in AI providing medical diagnoses, sometimes even over human physicians. Participants generally express concern with surgical AI, but they mistakenly believe that it is already being performed. As AI applications increase in medical practice, health care providers should be cognizant of the potential amount of misinformation and sensitivity that patients have to how such technology is represented.",0

126,Robot Assisted Training for the Upper Limb after Stroke (RATULS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Loss of arm function is a common and distressing consequence of stroke. We describe the protocol for a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial to determine whether robot-assisted training improves upper limb function following stroke.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      Study design: a pragmatic, three-arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial, economic analysis and process evaluation.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      NHS stroke services.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      adults with acute or chronic first-ever stroke (1 week to 5 years post stroke) causing moderate to severe upper limb functional limitation. Randomisation groups: 1. Robot-assisted training using the InMotion robotic gym system for 45 min, three times/week for 12 weeks 2. Enhanced upper limb therapy for 45 min, three times/week for 12 weeks 3. Usual NHS care in accordance with local clinical practice Randomisation: individual participant randomisation stratified by centre, time since stroke, and severity of upper limb impairment.
    


          Primary outcome:
        
      
      upper limb function measured by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) at 3 months post randomisation.
    


          Secondary outcomes:
        
      
      upper limb impairment (Fugl-Meyer Test), activities of daily living (Barthel ADL Index), quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale, EQ-5D-5L), resource use, cost per quality-adjusted life year and adverse events, at 3 and 6 months. Blinding: outcomes are undertaken by blinded assessors. Economic analysis: micro-costing and economic evaluation of interventions compared to usual NHS care. A within-trial analysis, with an economic model will be used to extrapolate longer-term costs and outcomes. Process evaluation: semi-structured interviews with participants and professionals to seek their views and experiences of the rehabilitation that they have received or provided, and factors affecting the implementation of the trial.
    


          Sample size:
        
      
      allowing for 10% attrition, 720 participants provide 80% power to detect a 15% difference in successful outcome between each of the treatment pairs. Successful outcome definition: baseline ARAT 0-7 must improve by 3 or more points; baseline ARAT 8-13 improve by 4 or more points; baseline ARAT 14-19 improve by 5 or more points; baseline ARAT 20-39 improve by 6 or more points.

127,Soft hybrid intrinsically motile robot for wireless small bowel enteroscopy,"Background:
        
      
      Difficulties in establishing diagnosis of small bowel (SB) disorders, prevented their effective treatment. This problem was largely resolved by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE), which has since become the first line investigation for suspected SB disorders. Several types of WCE pills are now used in clinical practice, despite their limitations and complications. WCE pills are large, rigid and immotile capsules. When swallowed, they provide SB enteroscopy downloaded to a data logger carried by the patient. Most of the complications of WCEs result from lack of intrinsic locomotion: incomplete examination, capsule retention and impaction within strictures. In addition, the rigid nature and size of current generation of WCE pills is accompanied by 0.1% inability to swallow the pill by patients with normal esophageal motility.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The aim of this communication is to describe the initial prototype, P1, which is thinner and slightly longer than the current generation of WCEs. In addition, it exhibits intrinsic active locomotion, produced by vibrating silicon legs. These generate a controlled-skid locomotion on the small bowel mucosal surface, rendered slippery by surface mucus and intraluminal surfactant bile salts. We demonstrate the mechanism responsible for the active locomotion of P1, which we consider translatable into a working prototype, suitable for further R&D for eventual clinical translation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The shape and attachment of the rubber vibrating legs to vibrating actuators, have been designed specifically to produce a tight clockwise circular motion. When inserted inside a circular tube in vitro of equivalent diameter to human small intestine, the intrinsic circular clockwise motion of P1 translates into a linear locomotion by the constraints imposed by the surrounding circular walls of SB and rest of the gastrointestinal tract. This design ensures device stability during transit, essential for imaging and targeting lesions encountered during the enteroscopy. We preformed two experiments: (i) transit of P1 through a phantom consisting of a segment of PVC tube placed on a horizontal surface and (ii) transit through a transparent slippery nylon sleeve insufflated with air. In the PVC tube, its transit rate averages 15.6 mm/s, which is too fast for endoscopy: whereas inside the very slippery nylon sleeve insufflated with air, the average transit rate of P1 is reduced to 5.9 mm/s, i.e., ideal for inspection endoscopy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These in-vitro experiments indicate that the P1 hybrid soft robot prototype has the potential specifically for clinical translation for SB enteroscopy.",4
128,A Delphi consensus statement for digital surgery,"The use of digital technology is increasing rapidly across surgical specialities, yet there is no consensus for the term 'digital surgery'. This is critical as digital health technologies present technical, governance, and legal challenges which are unique to the surgeon and surgical patient. We aim to define the term digital surgery and the ethical issues surrounding its clinical application, and to identify barriers and research goals for future practice. 38 international experts, across the fields of surgery, AI, industry, law, ethics and policy, participated in a four-round Delphi exercise. Issues were generated by an expert panel and public panel through a scoping questionnaire around key themes identified from the literature and voted upon in two subsequent questionnaire rounds. Consensus was defined if >70% of the panel deemed the statement important and <30% unimportant. A final online meeting was held to discuss consensus statements. The definition of digital surgery as the use of technology for the enhancement of preoperative planning, surgical performance, therapeutic support, or training, to improve outcomes and reduce harm achieved 100% consensus agreement. We highlight key ethical issues concerning data, privacy, confidentiality and public trust, consent, law, litigation and liability, and commercial partnerships within digital surgery and identify barriers and research goals for future practice. Developers and users of digital surgery must not only have an awareness of the ethical issues surrounding digital applications in healthcare, but also the ethical considerations unique to digital surgery. Future research into these issues must involve all digital surgery stakeholders including patients.",3
129,Diagnostic Tests for Female Bladder Outlet Obstruction: A Systematic Review from the European Association of Urology Non-neurogenic Female LUTS Guidelines Panel,"Context:
        
      
      Female bladder outlet obstruction (fBOO) is a relatively uncommon condition compared with its male counterpart. Several criteria have been proposed to define fBOO, but the comparative diagnostic accuracy of these remains uncertain.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify and compare different tests to diagnose fBOO through a systematic review process.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. The EMBASE/MEDLINE/Cochrane databases were searched up to August 4, 2020. Studies on women ≥18 yr of age with suspected bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) involving diagnostic tests were included. Pressure-flow studies or fluoroscopy was used as the reference standard where possible. Two reviewers independently screened all articles, searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and performed data extraction. The risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2).
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      Overall, 28 nonrandomised studies involving 10 248 patients were included in the qualitative analysis. There was significant heterogeneity regarding the characteristics of women included in BOO cohorts (ie, mixed cohorts including both anatomical and functional BOO). Pressure-flow studies ± fluoroscopy was evaluated in 25 studies. Transperineal Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate bladder neck dynamics in two studies. One study tested the efficacy of transvaginal ultrasound. The urodynamic definition of fBOO also varied amongst studies with different parameters and thresholds used, which precluded a meta-analysis. Three studies derived nomograms using the maximum flow rate (Qmax) and voiding detrusor pressure at Qmax. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy ranges were 54.6-92.5%, 64.6-93.9%, and 64.1-92.2%, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The available evidence on diagnostic tests for fBOO is limited and heterogeneous. Pressure-flow studies ± fluoroscopy remains the current standard for diagnosing fBOO.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Evidence on tests used to diagnose female bladder outlet obstruction was reviewed. The most common test used was pressure-flow studies ± fluoroscopy, which remains the current standard for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in women. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The available evidence on diagnostic tests for female bladder outlet obstruction is limited and heterogeneous. The most common test used was video-urodynamics, which remains the current standard for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in women.",5

131,"High-Grade Glioma Treatment Response Monitoring Biomarkers: A Position Statement on the Evidence Supporting the Use of Advanced MRI Techniques in the Clinic, and the Latest Bench-to-Bedside Developments. Part 1: Perfusion and Diffusion Techniques","Objective:
        
      
      Summarize evidence for use of advanced MRI techniques as monitoring biomarkers in the clinic, and highlight the latest bench-to-bedside developments.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Experts in advanced MRI techniques applied to high-grade glioma treatment response assessment convened through a European framework. Current evidence regarding the potential for monitoring biomarkers in adult high-grade glioma is reviewed, and individual modalities of perfusion, permeability, and microstructure imaging are discussed (in Part 1 of two). In Part 2, we discuss modalities related to metabolism and/or chemical composition, appraise the clinic readiness of the individual modalities, and consider post-processing methodologies involving the combination of MRI approaches (multiparametric imaging) or machine learning (radiomics).
    


          Results:
        
      
      High-grade glioma vasculature exhibits increased perfusion, blood volume, and permeability compared with normal brain tissue. Measures of cerebral blood volume derived from dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI have consistently provided information about brain tumor growth and response to treatment; it is the most clinically validated advanced technique. Clinical studies have proven the potential of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for distinguishing post-treatment related effects from recurrence, but the optimal acquisition protocol, mode of analysis, parameter of highest diagnostic value, and optimal cut-off points remain to be established. Arterial spin labeling techniques do not require the injection of a contrast agent, and repeated measurements of cerebral blood flow can be performed. The absence of potential gadolinium deposition effects allows widespread use in pediatric patients and those with impaired renal function. More data are necessary to establish clinical validity as monitoring biomarkers. Diffusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient analysis, diffusion tensor or kurtosis imaging, intravoxel incoherent motion, and other microstructural modeling approaches also allow treatment response assessment; more robust data are required to validate these alone or when applied to post-processing methodologies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Considerable progress has been made in the development of these monitoring biomarkers. Many techniques are in their infancy, whereas others have generated a larger body of evidence for clinical application.",0
132,"Outcome of Men With Relapses After Adjuvant Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin for Clinical Stage I Nonseminoma","Purpose:
        
      
      Clinical stage I (CSI) nonseminoma (NS) is a disease limited to the testis without metastases. One treatment strategy after orchiectomy is adjuvant chemotherapy. Little is known about the outcome of patients who experience relapse after such treatment.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Data from 51 patients with CSI NS who experienced a relapse after adjuvant bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) from 18 centers/11 countries were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes were overall and progression-free survivals calculated from day 1 of treatment at first relapse. Secondary outcomes were time to, stage at, and treatment of relapse and rate of subsequent relapses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median time to relapse was 13 months, with the earliest relapse 2 months after start of adjuvant treatment and the latest after 25 years. With a median follow-up of 96 months, the 5-year PFS was 67% (95% CI, 54% to 82%) and the 5-year OS was 81% (95% CI, 70% to 94%). Overall, 19 (37%) of 51 relapses occurred later than 2 years. Late relapses were associated with a significantly higher risk of death from NS (hazard ratio, 1.10 per year; P = .01). Treatment upon relapse was diverse: the majority of patients received a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Twenty-nine percent of patients experienced a subsequent relapse. At last follow-up, 41 patients (80%) were alive and disease-free, eight (16%) had died of progressive disease, and one patient (2%) each had died from therapy-related or other causes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Outcomes of patients with relapse after adjuvant BEP seem better compared with patients who experience relapse after treatment of metastatic disease but worse compared with those who have de-novo metastatic disease. We found a substantial rate of late and subsequent relapses. There seem to be three patterns of relapse with different outcomes: pure teratoma, early viable NS relapse (< 2 years), and late viable NS relapse (> 2 years).",0
133,Intermediate- and long-term oncological outcomes of active surveillance for localized renal masses: a systematic review and quantitative analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate intermediate- and long-term oncological outcomes of active surveillance (AS) for localized renal masses (LRMs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This systematic literature review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021230416). Studies on AS for LRMs with at least 3 years' follow-up were eligible. Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were metastasis rate, renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-specific mortality (RCC-SM) and all-cause mortality (ACM). Pooled estimates were obtained from random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were performed for small renal masses (SRMs; ≤4 cm) and non-SRMs (>4 cm).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We analysed 18 unique cohorts comprising 2066 patients. The pooled initial maximum tumour size was 2.8 cm (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-3.0) and the percutaneous biopsy rate was 28%. The pooled mean annual growth rate was 2.8 mm (95% CI 2.1-3.4). Within a pooled mean follow-up of 53 months, 2.1% (95% CI 1.0-3.6) of patients developed metastatic disease, 1.0% (95% CI 0.3-2.1) died from RCC and 22.6% (95% CI 15.8-30.2) died from any cause. For patients with SRMs (nine studies, n = 987), the pooled metastasis rate was 1.8% (95% CI 0.5-3.7), RCC-SM was 0.6% (95% CI 0-2.1), and ACM was 28.5% (95% CI 17.4-41.4). Across five studies reporting on outcomes of 239 patients with non-SRMs, the pooled metastasis rate was 5.1% (95% CI 0-17.3), RCC-SM was 2.1% (95% CI 0-8.9) and ACM was 29.1% (95% CI 13.6-47.3). This review is limited by non-standardized inclusion criteria, definitions and follow-up, data heterogeneity, limited patient numbers in sub-analyses and absence of high-quality studies.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Active surveillance is a safe intermediate- and long-term management option for well-selected patients with LRMs, especially those with SRMs. Limited data are available for non-SRMs, but current evidence would support further evaluation of this approach in selected patients. It is not possible to draw definitive conclusions until more high-quality data become available.",1
134,"Lifileucel, a Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy, in Metastatic Melanoma","Purpose:
        
      
      Effective treatment options are limited for patients with advanced (metastatic or unresectable) melanoma who progress after immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies. Adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has demonstrated efficacy in advanced melanoma. Lifileucel is an autologous, centrally manufactured tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte product.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a phase II open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in patients with advanced melanoma who had been previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor(s) and BRAF ± MEK targeted agents. Lifileucel was produced from harvested tumor specimens in central Good Manufacturing Practice facilities using a streamlined 22-day process. Patients received a nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion regimen, a single infusion of lifileucel, and up to six doses of high-dose interleukin-2. The primary end point was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST, version 1.1.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-six patients received a mean of 3.3 prior therapies (anti-programmed death 1 [PD-1] or programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1]: 100%; anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4: 80%; BRAF ± MEK inhibitor: 23%). The ORR was 36% (95% CI, 25 to 49), with two complete responses and 22 partial responses. Disease control rate was 80% (95% CI, 69 to 89). Median duration of response was not reached after 18.7-month median study follow-up (range, 0.2-34.1 months). In the primary refractory to anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy subset, the ORR and disease control rate were 41% (95% CI, 26 to 57) and 81% (95% CI, 66 to 91), respectively. Safety profile was consistent with known adverse events associated with nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion and interleukin-2.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Lifileucel demonstrated durable responses and addresses a major unmet need in patients with metastatic melanoma with limited treatment options after approved therapy, including the primary refractory to anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy subset.",0
135,Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of robotic versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision in management of rectal cancer,"Background:
        
      
      We aimed to evaluate comparative outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) in patients with rectal cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We systematically searched electronic data sources with application of combination of free text and controlled vocabulary search adapted to thesaurus headings, search operators, and limits. Perioperative clinical and short-term oncological outcomes were evaluated. Trial Sequential Analysis of the outcomes was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine randomised-controlled trials reporting 1463 patients evaluating outcomes of robotic TME (n = 728) and laparoscopic TME (n = 735) were included. Although the robotic approach was associated with significantly longer operative time (MD 31.64, P = 0.002), it was associated with significantly longer DRM (MD 0.8, P = 0.004) and shorter time to soft diet (MD - 0.50, P = 0.03) compared to the laparoscopic approach. Moreover, there was no significant difference in intraoperative (RR 1.07, P = 0.76)) and postoperative (RR 0.97, P = 0.81) complications, anastomotic leak (RR 0.93, P = 0.69), conversion to open rate (RR 0.46, P = 0.05), blood loss (MD 19.65, P = 0.74), time to first flatus (MD - 0.30, P = 0.37), LARS (RR 0.83, P = 0.41), ileus (RR 0.72, P = 0.39), positive CRM (RR 0.82, P = 0.49), PRM (MD - 0.5, P = 0.55), number of harvested lymph nodes (MD 0.33, P = 0.58), or length of stay (MD - 0.60, P = 0.12) between two groups. The Trial Sequential Analysis demonstrated that the risk of type 1 and type 2 errors was minimal in most outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Moderate-quality evidence suggested that robotic and laparoscopic TME may be comparable in terms of clinical and short-term oncological profile but the robotic approach may be associated with longer procedure time. Future high-quality randomised studies are encouraged to compare the functional, long-term oncological, and cost-effectiveness outcomes of both approaches.",2
136,Social Conformity Effects on Trust in Simulation-Based Human-Robot Interaction,"Objective:
        
      
      We investigated the co-acting influences of communication and social conformity on trust in human-robot interaction.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Previous work has investigated aspects of the robot, the human, and the environment as influential factors in the human-robot relationship. Little work has examined the conjoint effects of social conformity and communication on this relationship. As social conformity and communication have been shown to affect human-human trust, there are a priori reasons to believe that they will play an influential role in human-robot trust also.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The experiment examined the influences of social conformity and robot communication on trust. A 2 × 2 (communication × social group) design was implemented with each variable having two levels (communication, no communication; positive social group, negative social group).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We created a communication manipulation which we then demonstrated to mediate the trust level between human and robot. However, this influence on trust was overcome by social information in which the subsequent trust level, attributed to the robot, was dominated by expressed social group attitudes to that robot.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results confirm the importance of human social assessments over direct robot communication in setting human-robot trust levels. When social opinions are expressed, observers appear to conform to the trust displayed by the group than relying on their own judgment.
    


          Application:
        
      
      In human-robot teams, the perceptions of the group may exert a greater impact than even robot communication. This may be especially important when new human members are introduced into such teams.",4
137,Is Cryotherapy a Genuine Rival to Robotic-assisted Partial Nephrectomy in the Management of Suspected Renal Malignancy? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"We systematically reviewed the world literature and compare oncological outcomes, morbidity, renal function, and perioperative outcome between cryotherapy and robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for suspected renal malignancy. There was a statistically significant difference in ""recurrence rates"" between the 2 techniques, favoring the RAPN cohort. There was no statistically significant difference in overall and ≥Clavien 3a complication rates between the 2 techniques. The quality of evidence for recurrence rates, overall complication, and ≥Clavien 3a were ""moderate"", ""low,"" and ""very low,"" respectively, on GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. If a nephron sparing approach is indicated, RAPN should be the approach of choice.",2
138,State of the art in robotic rectal surgery: marginal gains worth the pain?,"After their first introduction in the 1990s to overcome the limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery, especially in confined spaces such as the pelvis, telemanipulators (i.e., master-slave manipulators) have gained popularity and acceptance among gastrointestinal surgeons. These complex, interventional surgical devices use multiple technologies, such as 3-D advanced imaging, tremor reduction and 7-degree movement. Superior instrument dexterity, stable precise vision and accessibility to narrow confined spaces make these devices well suited for colorectal surgery. The drive for innovations in the field of surgical robotics will leverage novel robots driven by data, image integration, and artificial intelligence. However, if this vision is to be realized, lessons must be learned from the current literature and clinical trials. The feasibility and safety of robotic rectal surgery is now well established; increasing evidence suggests that when compared to laparoscopic rectal surgery, robotic approaches might offer superior peri-operative outcomes. Notably, the marginal gains achieved with the use of robotics in rectal cancer surgery are linked with structured training and standardization of operative techniques. With decreasing costs and wider availability of new systems, it is foreseeable that robotic surgical systems will be an integral part of colorectal practice.",1
139,NeuroSAFE robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus standard robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for men with localised prostate cancer (NeuroSAFE PROOF): protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) offers potential cure for localised prostate cancer but is associated with considerable toxicity. Potency and urinary continence are improved when the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) are spared during a nerve spare (NS) RALP. There is reluctance, however, to perform NS RALP when there are concerns that the cancer extends beyond the capsule of the prostate into the NVB, as NS RALP in this instance increases the risk of a positive surgical margin (PSM). The NeuroSAFE technique involves intraoperative fresh-frozen section analysis of the posterolateral aspect of the prostate margin to assess whether cancer extends beyond the capsule. There is evidence from large observational studies that functional outcomes can be improved and PSM rates reduced when the NeuroSAFE technique is used during RALP. To date, however, there has been no randomised controlled trial (RCT) to substantiate this finding. The NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility study is designed to assess whether it is feasible to randomise men to NeuroSAFE RALP versus a control arm of 'standard of practice' RALP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility study will be a multicentre, single-blinded RCT with patients randomised 1:1 to either NeuroSAFE RALP (intervention) or standard RALP (control). Treatment allocation will occur after trial entry and consent. The primary outcome will be assessed as the successful accrual of 50 men at three sites over 15 months. Secondary outcomes will be used to aid subsequent power calculations for the definitive full-scale RCT and will include rates of NS; PSM; biochemical recurrence; adjuvant treatments; and patient-reported functional outcomes on potency, continence and quality of life.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      NeuroSAFE PROOF has ethical approval (Regional Ethics Committee reference 17/LO/1978). NeuroSAFE PROOF is supported by National Institute for Healthcare Research Research for Patient Benefit funding (NIHR reference PB-PG-1216-20013). Findings will be made available through peer-reviewed publications.

140,Critiquing the Reasons for Making Artificial Moral Agents,"Many industry leaders and academics from the field of machine ethics would have us believe that the inevitability of robots coming to have a larger role in our lives demands that robots be endowed with moral reasoning capabilities. Robots endowed in this way may be referred to as artificial moral agents (AMA). Reasons often given for developing AMAs are: the prevention of harm, the necessity for public trust, the prevention of immoral use, such machines are better moral reasoners than humans, and building these machines would lead to a better understanding of human morality. Although some scholars have challenged the very initiative to develop AMAs, what is currently missing from the debate is a closer examination of the reasons offered by machine ethicists to justify the development of AMAs. This closer examination is especially needed because of the amount of funding currently being allocated to the development of AMAs (from funders like Elon Musk) coupled with the amount of attention researchers and industry leaders receive in the media for their efforts in this direction. The stakes in this debate are high because moral robots would make demands on society; answers to a host of pending questions about what counts as an AMA and whether they are morally responsible for their behavior or not. This paper shifts the burden of proof back to the machine ethicists demanding that they give good reasons to build AMAs. The paper argues that until this is done, the development of commercially available AMAs should not proceed further.",3
141,NeuroVis: Real-Time Neural Information Measurement and Visualization of Embodied Neural Systems,"Understanding the real-time dynamical mechanisms of neural systems remains a significant issue, preventing the development of efficient neural technology and user trust. This is because the mechanisms, involving various neural spatial-temporal ingredients [i.e., neural structure (NS), neural dynamics (ND), neural plasticity (NP), and neural memory (NM)], are too complex to interpret and analyze altogether. While advanced tools have been developed using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), node-link diagram, topography map, and other visualization techniques, they still fail to monitor and visualize all of these neural ingredients online. Accordingly, we propose here for the first time ""NeuroVis,"" real-time neural spatial-temporal information measurement and visualization, as a method/tool to measure temporal neural activities and their propagation throughout the network. By using this neural information along with the connection strength and plasticity, NeuroVis can visualize the NS, ND, NM, and NP via i) spatial 2D position and connection, ii) temporal color gradient, iii) connection thickness, and iv) temporal luminous intensity and change of connection thickness, respectively. This study presents three use cases of NeuroVis to evaluate its performance: i) function approximation using a modular neural network with recurrent and feedforward topologies together with supervised learning, ii) robot locomotion control and learning using the same modular network with reinforcement learning, and iii) robot locomotion control and adaptation using another larger-scale adaptive modular neural network. The use cases demonstrate how NeuroVis tracks and analyzes all neural ingredients of various (embodied) neural systems in real-time under the robot operating system (ROS) framework. To this end, it will offer the opportunity to better understand embodied dynamic neural information processes, boost efficient neural technology development, and enhance user trust.",4
142,Should All Minimal Access Surgery Be Robot-Assisted? A Systematic Review into the Musculoskeletal and Cognitive Demands of Laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Surgeons are among the most at risk of work-related musculoskeletal health decline because of the physical demands of surgery, which is also associated with cognitive fatigue. Minimally invasive surgery offers excellent benefits to patients but the impact of robotic or laparoscopic surgery on surgeon well-being is less well understood. This work examined the musculoskeletal and cognitive demands of robot-assisted versus standard laparoscopic surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for 'Muscle strain' AND 'musculoskeletal fatigue' AND 'occupational diseases' OR 'cognitive fatigue' AND 'mental fatigue' OR 'standard laparoscopic surgery' AND 'robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery'. Primary outcomes measured were electromyographic (EMG) activity for musculoskeletal fatigue and questionnaires (NASA-TLX, SMEQ, or Borg CR-10) for cognitive fatigue. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) Guidelines. The study was preregistered on Prospero ID: CRD42020184881.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two hundred and ninety-eight original titles were identified. Ten studies that were all observational studies were included in the systematic review. EMG activity was consistently lower in robotic than in laparoscopic surgery in the erector spinae and flexor digitorum muscles but higher in the trapezius muscle. This was associated with significantly lower cognitive load in robotic than laparoscopic surgery in 7 of 10 studies.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Evidence suggests a reduction in musculoskeletal demands during robotic surgery in muscles excluding the trapezius, and this is associated with most studies reporting a reduced cognitive load. Robotic surgery appears to have less negative cognitive and musculoskeletal impact on surgeons compared to laparoscopic surgery.",1
143,"Two Hundred Twenty-Six Consecutive Deep Brain Stimulation Electrodes Placed Using an ""Asleep"" Technique and the Neuro|MateTM Robot for the Treatment of Movement Disorders","Background:
        
      
      Robotics in neurosurgery has demonstrated widening indications and rapid growth in recent years. Robotic precision and reproducibility are especially pertinent to the field of functional neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) requires accurate placement of electrodes in order to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects. In addition, asleep techniques demand clear target visualization and immediate on-table verification of accuracy.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To describe the surgical technique of asleep DBS surgery using the Neuro|MateTM Robot (Renishaw plc, Wotton-under-Edge, United Kingdom) and examine the accuracy of DBS lead placement in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the treatment of movement disorders.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A single-center retrospective review of 113 patients who underwent bilateral STN/Zona Incerta electrode placement was performed. Accuracy of implantation was assessed using 5 measurements, Euclidian distance, radial error, depth error, angular error, and shift error.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 226 planned vs actual electrode placements were analyzed. The mean 3-dimensional vector error calculated for 226 trajectories was 0.78 +/- 0.37 mm. The mean radial displacement off planned trajectory was 0.6 +/- 0.33 mm. The mean depth error, angular error, and shift error was 0.4 +/- 0.35 mm, 0.4 degrees, and 0.3 mm, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This report details our institution's method for DBS lead placement in patients under general anaesthesia using anatomical targeting without microelectrode recordings or intraoperative test stimulation for the treatment of movement disorders. This is the largest reported dataset of accuracy results in DBS surgery performed asleep. This novel robot-assisted operative technique results in sub-millimeter accuracy in DBS electrode placement.",0
144,Assessment of Discrepancies Between Follow-up Infarct Volume and 90-Day Outcomes Among Patients With Ischemic Stroke Who Received Endovascular Therapy,"Importance:
        
      
      Some patients have poor outcomes despite small infarcts after endovascular therapy (EVT), while others with large infarcts do well. Understanding why these discrepancies occur may help to optimize EVT outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To validate exploratory findings from the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion with Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial regarding pretreatment, treatment-related, and posttreatment factors associated with discrepancies between follow-up infarct volume (FIV) and 90-day functional outcome.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This cohort study is a post hoc analysis of the Safety and Efficacy of Nerinetide in Subjects Undergoing Endovascular Thrombectomy for Stroke (ESCAPE-NA1) trial, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial conducted from March 2017 to August 2019. Patients who participated in ESCAPE-NA1 and had available 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and 24-hour to 48-hour posttreatment follow-up parenchymal imaging were included.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Small FIV (volume ≤25th percentile) and large FIV (volume ≥75th percentile) on 24-hour computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline factors, outcomes, treatments, and poststroke serious adverse events (SAEs) were compared between discrepant cases (ie, patients with 90-day mRS score ≥3 despite small FIV or those with mRS scores ≤2 despite large FIV) and nondiscrepant cases.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Area under the curve (AUC) and goodness of fit of prespecified logistic models, including pretreatment (eg, age, cancer, vascular risk factors) and treatment-related and posttreatment (eg, SAEs) factors, were compared with stepwise regression-derived models for ability to identify small FIV with higher mRS score and large FIV with lower mRS score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 1091 patients (median [IQR] age, 70.8 [60.8-79.8] years; 549 [49.7%] women; median [IQR] FIV, 24.9 mL [6.6-92.2 mL]), 42 of 287 patients (14.6%) with FIV of 7 mL or less (ie, ≤25th percentile) had an mRS score of at least 3; 65 of 275 patients (23.6%) with FIV of 92 mL or greater (ie, ≥75th percentile) had an mRS score of 2 or less. Prespecified models of pretreatment factors (ie, age, cancer, vascular risk factors) associated with low FIV and higher mRS score performed similarly to models selected by stepwise regression (AUC, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.89-0.95] vs 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95]; P = .42). SAEs, specifically infarct in new territory, recurrent stroke, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure, were associated with low FIV and higher mRS scores; stepwise models also identified 24-hour hemoglobin as treatment-related/posttreatment factor (AUC, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95] vs 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.96]; P = .14). Younger age was associated with high FIV and lower mRS score; stepwise models identified absence of diabetes and higher baseline hemoglobin as additional pretreatment factors (AUC, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.82] vs 0.77 [95% CI, 0.71-0.83]; P = .82). Absence of SAEs, especially stroke progression, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and pneumonia, was associated with high FIV and lower mRS score2; stepwise models also identified 24-hour hemoglobin level, glucose, and diastolic blood pressure as posttreatment factors associated with discrepant cases (AUC, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87] vs 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72-0.86]; P = .92).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      In this study, discrepancies between functional outcome and post-EVT infarct volume were associated with differences in pretreatment factors, such as age and comorbidities, and posttreatment complications related to index stroke evolution, secondary prevention, and quality of stroke unit care. Besides preventing such complications, optimization of blood pressure, glucose levels, and hemoglobin levels are potentially modifiable factors meriting further study.",0
145,NeuroSAFE frozen section during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: peri-operative and histopathological outcomes from the NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility randomized controlled trial,"Objectives:
        
      
      To report on the methods, peri-operative outcomes and histopathological concordance between frozen and final section from the NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility study (NCT03317990).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Between May 2018 and March 2019, 49 patients at two UK centres underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Twenty-five patient were randomized to NeuroSAFE RARP (intervention arm) and 24 to standard RARP (control arm). Frozen section was compared to final paraffin section margin assessment in the 25 patients in the NeuroSAFE arm. Operation timings and complications were collected prospectively in both arms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty neurovascular bundles (NVBs) from 25 patients in the NeuroSAFE arm were analysed. When analysed by each pathological section (n = 250, average five per side), we noted a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 99.2%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.994 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.985 to 1; P ≤0.001). On an NVB basis (n = 50), sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 92.7%, and the AUC was 0.963 (95% CI 0.914 to 1; P ≤0.001). NeuroSAFE RARP lasted a mean of 3 h 16 min (knife to skin to off table, 95% CI 3 h 2 min-3 h 30 min) compared to 2 h 4 min (95% CI 2 h 2 min-2 h 25 min; P ≤0.001) for standard RARP. There was no morbidity associated with the additional length of operating time on in the NeuroSAFE arm.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This feasibility study demonstrates the safety, reproducibility and excellent histopathological concordance of the NeuroSAFE technique in the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial. Although the technique increases the duration of RARP, this does not cause short-term harm. Confirmation of feasibility has led to the opening of the fully powered NeuroSAFE PROOF randomized controlled trial, which is currently under way at four sites in the UK.",2
146,A review of the evolution of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty,"Introduction:
        
      
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently a very successful operation but continues to evolve as we try to perfect techniques and improve outcomes for our patients. Robotic hip surgery (RHS) began with the 'active' ROBODOC system in the 1980s. There were drawbacks associated with the original ROBODOC and most recently, the MAKO robot was introduced with early promising results.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review surrounding this area and discuss the pros and cons of this technique.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature review searching Medline, Embase, Ovidsp, Cochrane library, pubmed database and google scholar was performed searching keywords including: 'Robotic hip surgery', 'Robotic orthopaedic surgery', 'Computer assisted hip surgery', 'robotic arthroplasty', and 'computer assisted orthopaedic surgery'.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic hip surgery aims to tackle the limitations of the human factor in surgery by promising reproducible and reliable methods of component positioning in arthroplasty surgery. However, as orthopaedic surgeons, we must critically appraise all new technology and support the use providing there is sound robust evidence backing it.",1
147,Transoral Robotic Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea-Hypopnoea Syndrome,"Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea (OSAH) syndrome constitutes a major health care problem. Surgical modalities for the treatment of OSAH are regaining momentum in view of the increasing prevalence of OSAH and the low compliance rates associated with continuous positive airway pressure. There are several investigations to complement clinical examination in accurately determining the level of airway collapse to ensure correct patient selection and a targeted surgical approach. The most commonly employed include drug-induced sleep endoscopy and imaging with the tongue base and epiglottis often revealed as the major sites of airway narrowing during sleep. In the continuing search for the optimal approach to address these areas, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has been successfully used for tongue base reduction and epiglottoplasty. With sufficient experience, this technique is safe and well tolerated. Meticulous work-up and careful patient selection are crucial. Multiple studies have demonstrated very good short-term results of TORS for OSAH, with significant reduction in both the Apnoea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS). With the appropriate infrastructure, proctoring, and access to robotic surgical technology, it is possible for these results to be reproduced more widely. Further prospective long-term clinical evaluation will ultimately determine the exact role of TORS in the treatment of OSAH.",0
148,Robotic surgery for colorectal cancer in the Octogenarians,"Background:
        
      
      We evaluated the short-term outcomes of robotic colorectal cancer surgery in octogenarian patients, focussing on postoperative morbidity and survival.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All patients ≥80 years in a prospective colorectal cancer database undergoing robotic curative colorectal cancer resection were included. Patient demographics, intraoperative findings, postoperative and oncological outcomes were recorded. Patients were further subdivided into two groups named: old (OG 80-85 years) and very old (VOG ≥ 86 years).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty-eight consecutive patients were included (median age, 83 years; male, 53.4%; median BMI, 26.5). Median total operative time was 230 min, median blood loss 20 ml, median length of stay 7 days. Major complications were seen in 12% of patients; and the 90-day mortality rate was 1.7%. Complete R0 resection achieved in 93% of cases, average lymph node harvest was 22. Overall and disease-free survival was 81% and 87.3%, respectively (median follow-up 24.5 months). We noticed a trend towards more advanced lesion staging in the VOG, but only N2 stage was significant (p = 0.03). There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival in favour of the OG (p = 0.024).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic surgery is feasible in octogenarian patients undergoing curative colorectal cancer resection and is associated with good post-operative outcomes and overall survival.",9
149,Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion: impact on an established enhanced recovery protocol,"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the impact of the introduction of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) on an established enhanced recovery programme (ERP) and to examine the effect on mortality and morbidity rates, transfusion rates, and length of stay (LOS).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Data on 102 consecutive patients undergoing RARC with full intracorporeal reconstruction were obtained from our prospectively updated institutional database. These data were compared to previously published retrospective results from three separate groups of patients undergoing open radical cystectomy (ORC) at our centre. Our primary focus was perioperative outcomes including transfusion rate, complication rates, 30- and 90-day mortality rates, and LOS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The demographics of the comparative groups showed no significant difference in age, gender distribution, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade. A significant reduction in transfusion rate was seen in RARC vs ORC (P < 0.001). The median LOS for the RARC group was 8 vs 13 days for the ORC group (P < 0.001). There was trend to a lower total complication rate (48% vs 31%). The 30- and 90-day mortality rates were equivalent between the groups (2%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Introduction of RARC and intracorporeal reconstruction represents the single biggest impact on our ERP, with significant reduction in transfusion rates and LOS, and a trend towards a lower complication rate.",2
150,"Preclinical Evaluation of the Versius Surgical System, a New Robot-assisted Surgical Device for Use in Minimal Access Renal and Prostate Surgery","Background:
        
      
      Minimal access surgery (MAS) is well-established in urological surgery. However, MAS is technically demanding and associated with a prolonged learning curve. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has made progress in overcoming these challenges.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new robot-assisted surgical system (the Versius Surgical System; CMR Surgical, Cambridge, UK) for renal and prostate procedures in a preclinical setting, at the IDEAL-D phase 0.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Cadaveric sessions were conducted to evaluate the ability of the system to complete all surgical steps required for a radical nephrectomy, prostatectomy, and pelvic lymph node dissection. A live animal (porcine) model was also used to assess the surgical device in performing radical nephrectomy safely and effectively. Procedures were performed by experienced renal and prostate surgeons, supported by a full operating room team.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Surgical access and reach were evaluated by the lead surgeon using a visual analogue scale. The precise surgical steps conducted to make the assessment that the procedures could be completed fully were recorded, as well as instruments used (including manual laparoscopic instruments) and endoscope angle.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      In total, all 24 procedures were completed successfully in cadavers by eight different lead surgeons. Positioning of the ports and bedside units reflected the lead surgeon's preferred laparoscopic set-up and enabled good surgical access and reach, as quantified by a median visual analogue score of ≥6.5. Radical nephrectomies performed in pigs were all completed successfully, with no device- or non-device-related intraoperative complications recorded. Testing in human cadavers and pig models balances the bias introduced by each model; however, it is impossible to completely replicate the experience and performance of the robot for surgery in live humans.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first preclinical assessment of the Versius Surgical System for renal and prostate procedures. The safety and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated and warrant progressive assessment in a clinical setting utilising the IDEAL-D framework.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this report, we looked at the usability of a new robot-assisted surgical device for renal and prostate surgery by testing the system in cadavers and pigs. We found that a number of different surgeons and operating team personnel were able to use the system to successfully complete the procedures under evaluation. We conclude that the system is ready to be tested in live human studies.",1
151,Safe implementation of minimally invasive pancreas resection: a systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive pancreas resection (MIPR) has been expanding in the past decade. Excellent outcomes have been reported, however, safety concerns exist. The aim of this study was to define prerequisites for performing MIPR with the objective to guide safe implementation of MIPR into clinical practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This systematic review was conducted as part of the 2019 Miami International Evidence-Based Guidelines on Minimally Invasive Pancreas Resection (IG-MIPR). PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for literature concerning the implementation of MIPR between 1946 and November 2018. Quality assessment was according to The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 1150 studies were screened, of which 32 studies with 8519 patients were included in this systematic review. Training programs for minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy, laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy and robotic pancreatoduodenectomy have been described with acceptable outcomes during the learning curve and improved outcomes after training. Learning curve studies have revealed an association between growing experience and improving perioperative outcomes. In addition, the association between higher center volume and lower mortality and morbidity has been reported by several studies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      When embarking on MIPR, it is recommended to participate in a dedicated training program, to assure a sufficient volume, especially when implementing minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy, (20 procedures recommended annually), and prospectively collect and closely monitor outcomes for continuous quality assessment, this can be achieved through institutional databases and participation in national or international registries.",3
152,"Natural history, angiographic presentation and outcomes of anterior cranial fossa dural arteriovenous fistulas","Background:
        
      
      Anterior cranial fossa dural arteriovenous fistulas (ACF-dAVFs) are aggressive vascular lesions. The pattern of venous drainage is the most important determinant of symptoms. Due to the absence of a venous sinus in the anterior cranial fossa, most ACF-dAVFs have some degree of drainage through small cortical veins. We describe the natural history, angiographic presentation and outcomes of the largest cohort of ACF-dAVFs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The CONDOR consortium includes data from 12 international centers. Patients included in the study were diagnosed with an arteriovenous fistula between 1990-2017. ACF-dAVFs were selected from a cohort of 1077 arteriovenous fistulas. The presentation, angioarchitecture and treatment outcomes of ACF-dAVF were extracted and analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      60 ACF-dAVFs were included in the analysis. Most ACF-dAVFs were symptomatic (38/60, 63%). The most common symptomatic presentation was intracranial hemorrhage (22/38, 57%). Most ACF-dAVFs drained through cortical veins (85%, 51/60), which in most instances drained into the superior sagittal sinus (63%, 32/51). The presence of cortical venous drainage predicted symptomatic presentation (OR 9.4, CI 1.98 to 69.1, p=0.01). Microsurgery was the most effective modality of treatment. 56% (19/34) of symptomatic patients who were treated had complete resolution of symptoms. Improvement of symptoms was not observed in untreated symptomatic ACF-dAVFs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Most ACF-dAVFs have a symptomatic presentation. Drainage through cortical veins is a key angiographic feature of ACF-dAVFs that accounts for their malignant course. Microsurgery is the most effective treatment. Due to the high risk of bleeding, closure of ACF-dAVFs is indicated regardless of presentation.",0
153,What Is the Most Effective Management of the Primary Tumor in Men with Invasive Penile Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Available Treatment Options and Their Outcomes,"Context:
        
      
      The primary lesion in penile cancer is managed by surgery or radiation. Surgical options include penile-sparing surgery, amputative surgery, laser excision, and Moh's micrographic surgery. Radiation is applied as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. The treatment aims to completely remove the primary lesion and preserve a sufficient functional penile stump.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess whether the 5-yr recurrence-free rate and other outcomes, such as sexual function, quality of life, urination, and penile preserving length, vary between various treatment options.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      The EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Cochrane HTA, DARE, HEED), Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for publications from 1990 through May 2021. Randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized comparative studies (NRCSs), and case series (CSs) were included.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      The systematic review included 88 studies, involving 9578 men from 16 NRCSs and 72 CSs. The cumulative mean 5-yr recurrence-free rates were 82.0% for penile-sparing surgery, 83.9% for amputative surgery, 78.6% for brachytherapy, 55.2% for EBRT, 69.4% for lasers, and 88.2% for Moh's micrographic surgery, as reported from CSs, and 76.7% for penile-sparing surgery and 93.3% for amputative surgery, as reported from NRCSs. Penile surgery affects sexual function, but amputative surgery causes more appearance concerns. After brachytherapy, 25% of patients reported sexual dysfunction. Both penile-sparing surgery and amputative surgery affect all aspects of psychosocial well-being.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite the poor quality of evidence, data suggest that penile-sparing surgery is not inferior to amputative surgery in terms of recurrence rates in selected patients. Based on the available information, however, broadly applicable recommendations cannot be made; appropriate patient selection accounts for the relative success of all the available methods.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We reviewed the evidence of various techniques to treat penile tumor and assessed their effectiveness in oncologic control and their functional outcomes. Penile-sparing as well as amputative surgery is an effective treatment option, but amputative surgery has a negative impact on sexual function. Penile-sparing surgery and radiotherapy are associated with a higher risk of local recurrence, but preserve sexual function and quality of life better. Laser and Moh's micrographic surgery could be used for smaller lesions.",1
154,Comparison between the difficulty of laparoscopic limited liver resections of tumors located in segment 7 versus segment 8: An international multicenter propensity-score matched study,"Background:
        
      
      Presently, according to different difficulty scoring systems, there is no difference in complexity estimation of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) of segments 7 and 8. However, there is no published data supporting this assumption. To date, no studies have compared the outcomes of laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing resection of the liver segments 7 and 8.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A post hoc analysis of patients undergoing LLR of segments 7 and 8 in 46 centers between 2004 and 2020 was performed. 1:1 Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare isolated LLR of segments 7 and 8. Subset analyses were also performed to compare atypical resections and segmentectomies of 7 and 8.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 2411 patients were identified, and 1691 patients met the inclusion criteria. Comparison after PSM between the entire cohort of segment 7 and segment 8 resections revealed inferior results for segment 7 resection in terms of increased blood loss, blood transfusions, and conversions to open surgery. Subset analyses of only atypical resections similarly demonstrated poorer outcomes for segment 7 in terms of increased blood loss, operation time, blood transfusions, and conversions to open surgery. Conversely, a subgroup analysis of segmentectomies after PSM found better outcomes for segment 7 in terms of a shorter operation time and hospital stay.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Differences in the outcomes of segments 7 and 8 resections suggest a greater difficulty of laparoscopic atypical resection of segment 7 compared to segment 8, and greater difficulty of segmentectomy 8 compared to segmentectomy 7.",9
155,A narrative review on characterization of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19-infected lungs using artificial intelligence,"COVID-19 has infected 77.4 million people worldwide and has caused 1.7 million fatalities as of December 21, 2020. The primary cause of death due to COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARS-CoV-2. Medical imaging provides a non-invasive, touch-free, and relatively safer alternative tool for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings.",0
156,"Study protocol for VIdeo assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy versus conventional Open LobEcTomy for lung cancer, a UK multicentre randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot (the VIOLET study)","Introduction:
        
      
      Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and surgery remains the main treatment for early stage disease. Prior to the introduction of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), lung resection for cancer was undertaken through an open thoracotomy. To date, the evidence base supporting the different surgical approaches is based on non-randomised studies, small randomised trials and is focused mainly on short-term in-hospital outcomes.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      The VIdeo assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy versus conventional Open LobEcTomy for lung cancer study is a UK multicentre parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) with blinding of outcome assessors and participants (to hospital discharge) comparing the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of VATS lobectomy versus open lobectomy for treatment of lung cancer. We will test the hypothesis that VATS lobectomy is superior to open lobectomy with respect to self-reported physical function 5 weeks after randomisation (approximately 1 month after surgery). Secondary outcomes include assessment of efficacy (hospital stay, pain, proportion and time to uptake of chemotherapy), measures of safety (adverse health events), oncological outcomes (proportion of patients upstaged to pathologic N2 (pN2) disease and disease-free survival), overall survival and health related quality of life to 1 year. The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention is integrated into the trial to optimise recruitment.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      This trial has been approved by the UK (Dulwich) National Research Ethics Service Committee London. Findings will be written-up as methodology papers for conference presentation, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Many aspects of the feasibility work will inform surgical RCTs in general and these will be reported at methodology meetings. We will also link with lung cancer clinical studies groups. The patient and public involvement group that works with the Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit at the Brompton Hospital will help identify how we can best publicise the findings.

157,Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines,"Anorectal emergencies comprise a wide variety of diseases that share common symptoms, i.e., anorectal pain or bleeding and might require immediate management. While most of the underlying conditions do not need inpatient management, some of them could be life-threatening and need prompt recognition and treatment. It is well known that an incorrect diagnosis is frequent for anorectal diseases and that a delayed diagnosis is related to an impaired outcome. This paper aims to improve the knowledge and the awareness on this specific topic and to provide a useful tool for every physician dealing with anorectal emergencies.The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES-AAST-WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES-AAST panel of experts was reached. We structured our work into seven main topics to cover the entire management of patients with anorectal emergencies and to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.",0
158,Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: updated clinical practice guidelines,"Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome that is characterised by a high prevalence of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. It is largely caused by inactivating germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDH1, although pathogenic variants in CTNNA1 occur in a minority of families with HDGC. In this Policy Review, we present updated clinical practice guidelines for HDGC from the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC), which recognise the emerging evidence of variability in gastric cancer risk between families with HDGC, the growing capability of endoscopic and histological surveillance in HDGC, and increased experience of managing long-term sequelae of total gastrectomy in young patients. To redress the balance between the accessibility, cost, and acceptance of genetic testing and the increased identification of pathogenic variant carriers, the HDGC genetic testing criteria have been relaxed, mainly through less restrictive age limits. Prophylactic total gastrectomy remains the recommended option for gastric cancer risk management in pathogenic CDH1 variant carriers. However, there is increasing confidence from the IGCLC that endoscopic surveillance in expert centres can be safely offered to patients who wish to postpone surgery, or to those whose risk of developing gastric cancer is not well defined.",0
159,Electrical impedance guides electrode array in cochlear implantation using machine learning and robotic feeder,"Cochlear Implant provides an electronic substitute for hearing to severely or profoundly deaf patients. However, postoperative hearing outcomes significantly depend on the proper placement of electrode array (EA) into scala tympani (ST) during cochlear implant surgery. Due to limited intra-operative methods to access array placement, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between EA complex impedance and different insertion trajectories in a plastic ST model. A prototype system was designed to measure bipolar complex impedance (magnitude and phase) and its resistive and reactive components of electrodes. A 3-DoF actuation system was used as an insertion feeder. 137 insertions were performed from 3 different directions at a speed of 0.08 mm/s. Complex impedance data of 8 electrode pairs were sequentially recorded in each experiment. Machine learning algorithms were employed to classify both the full and partial insertion lengths. Support Vector Machine (SVM) gave the highest 97.1% accuracy for full insertion. When a real-time prediction was tested, Shallow Neural Network (SNN) model performed better than other algorithms using partial insertion data. The highest accuracy was found at 86.1% when 4 time samples and 2 apical electrode pairs were used. Direction prediction using partial data has the potential of online control of the insertion feeder for better EA placement. Accessing the position of the electrode array during the insertion has the potential to optimize its intraoperative placement that will result in improved hearing outcomes.",0
160,Early robot-assisted gait retraining in non-ambulatory patients with stroke: a single blind randomized controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Restoration of walking function is a primary concern of neurorehabilitation with respect to the aspired social and vocational reintegration. To date, the best practice for improving gait early after stroke is still object of debate. On one hand, repetitive task-specific approaches with higher intensities of walking have been observed to result in greater improvements of gait after stroke. Conversely there is some evidence that conventional gait training would be more effective for facilitating walking ability after stroke.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To compare the effects of an early treatment protocol of add-on robot-assisted gait training with add-on conventional overground physiotherapy for improving locomotion in non-ambulatory adult stroke patients.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Single-blind randomized controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Neurorehabilitation hospital.
    


          Population:
        
      
      Seventy-four subacute patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The patients were randomized into two groups. The training program consisted of forty, 2-hour sessions (including 45 minutes basic training, 45 minutes add-on training plus rest periods), 5 days a week, for 8 consecutive weeks. Patients allocated to the add-on robot-assisted gait training were treated by means of the Lokomat. Patients allocated to the add-on conventional overground gait training aimed at improving postural control during gait, body weight transfer, stability during the stance phase, free swing phase, adequate heel contact and gait pattern. Primary outcome was the modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile. Secondary outcomes were the Rivermead Motor Index, the Mobility Milestones and the Hochzirl Walking Aids Profile.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No significant difference was observed between groups with regards to age (P=0.661), time from stroke onset (P=0.413) and the primary outcome (P=0.854) at baseline evaluation. As to the primary outcome, no significant differences were found between groups at the end of the study. As During the 8-week training, within-group comparisons showed significant improvements of mean modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile in both groups (P<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results support the hypothesis that an early treatment protocol of robot-assisted gait retraining is not superior to add-on conventional gait training intervention for improving locomotion in non-ambulatory stroke patients.
    


          Clinical rehabilitation impact:
        
      
      This study might help to better understand the role of robot-assisted gait training in early phase stroke rehabilitation.",2
161,Robotic-assisted laparoscopic vs abdominal and laparoscopic myomectomy: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Herein is presented a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence related to operative outcomes associated with robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy (RLM) compared with abdominal myomectomy (AM) and laparoscopic myomectomy (LM). Outcome measures included estimated blood loss (EBL), blood transfusion, operating time, complications, length of hospital stay (LOHS), and costs. Meta-analysis 1 compared RLM vs AM, and meta-analysis 2 compared RLM vs LM. Studies scored moderately well on the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. No significant differences were found in age, body mass index, or number, diameter, and weight of myomas. In meta-analysis 1, EBL, blood transfusion, and LOHS were significantly lower; risk of complications was similar; and operating time and costs were significantly higher with RLM. In meta-analysis 2, no significant differences were noted in EBL, operating time, complications, and LOHS with RLM; however, blood transfusion risk and costs were higher. It was concluded that insofar as operative outcomes, RLM has significant short-term benefits compared with AM and no benefits compared with LM. Long-term benefits such as recurrence, fertility, and obstetric outcomes remain uncertain.",8
162,Robotic versus conventional laparoscopic liver resections: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Theoretical advantages of robotic surgery compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery include improved instrument dexterity, 3D visualization, and better ergonomics. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine advantages of robotic surgery over laparoscopic surgery in patients undergoing liver resections.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted for studies comparing robotic assisted or totally laparoscopic liver resection. Meta-analysis of intraoperative (operative time, blood loss, transfusion rate, conversion rate), oncological (R0 resection rates), and postoperative (bile leak, surgical site infection, pulmonary complications, 30-day and 90-day mortality, length of stay, 90-day readmission and reoperation rates) outcomes was performed using a random effects model.
    


          Result:
        
      
      Twenty-six non-randomized studies including 2630 patients (950 robotic and 1680 laparoscopic) were included, of which 20% had major robotic liver resection and 14% had major laparoscopic liver resection. Intraoperatively, robotic liver resection was associated with significantly less blood loss (mean: 286 vs 301 mL, p < 0.001) but longer operating time (mean: 281 vs 221 min, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in conversion rates or transfusion rates between robotic liver resection and laparoscopic liver resection. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in overall complications, bile leaks, and length of hospital stay between robotic liver resection and laparoscopic liver resection. However, robotic liver resection was associated with significantly lower readmission rates than laparoscopic liver resection (odds ratio: 0.43, p = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic liver resection appears to offer some advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery, although both techniques appear equivalent. Importantly, the quality of evidence is generally limited to cohort studies and a high-quality randomized trial comparing both techniques is needed.",9
163,Expert Consensus Recommendations for Robotic Surgery Credentialing,"Objective:
        
      
      To define criteria for robotic credentialing using expert consensus.
    


          Background:
        
      
      A recent review of institutional robotic credentialing policies identified significant variability and determined current policies are largely inadequate to ensure surgeon proficiency and may threaten patient safety.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-eight national robotic surgery experts were invited to participate in a consensus conference. After review of available institutional policies and discussion, the group developed a 91 proposed criteria. Using a modified Delphi process the experts were asked to indicate their agreement with the proposed criteria in three electronic survey rounds after the conference. Criteria that achieved 80% or more in agreement (consensus) in all rounds were included in the final list.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All experts agreed that there is a need for standardized robotic surgery credentialing criteria across institutions that promote surgeon proficiency. Forty-nine items reached consensus in the first round, 19 in the second, and 8 in the third for a total of 76 final items. Experts agreed that privileges should be granted based on video review of surgical performance and attainment of clearly defined objective proficiency benchmarks. Parameters for ongoing outcome monitoring were determined and recommendations for technical skills training, proctoring, and performance assessment were defined.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using a systematic approach, detailed credentialing criteria for robotic surgery were defined. implementation of these criteria uniformly across institutions will promote proficiency of robotic surgeons and has the potential to positively impact patient outcomes.",3
164,MSDESIS: Multitask Stereo Disparity Estimation and Surgical Instrument Segmentation,"Reconstructing the 3D geometry of the surgical site and detecting instruments within it are important tasks for surgical navigation systems and robotic surgery automation. Traditional approaches treat each problem in isolation and do not account for the intrinsic relationship between segmentation and stereo matching. In this paper, we present a learning-based framework that jointly estimates disparity and binary tool segmentation masks. The core component of our architecture is a shared feature encoder which allows strong interaction between the aforementioned tasks. Experimentally, we train two variants of our network with different capacities and explore different training schemes including both multi-task and single-task learning. Our results show that supervising the segmentation task improves our network's disparity estimation accuracy. We demonstrate a domain adaptation scheme where we supervise the segmentation task with monocular data and achieve domain adaptation of the adjacent disparity task, reducing disparity End-Point-Error and depth mean absolute error by 77.73% and 61.73% respectively compared to the pre-trained baseline model. Our best overall multi-task model, trained with both disparity and segmentation data in subsequent phases, achieves 89.15% mean Intersection-over-Union in RIS and 3.18 millimetre depth mean absolute error in SCARED test sets. Our proposed multi-task architecture is real-time, able to process ( 1280×1024 ) stereo input and simultaneously estimate disparity maps and segmentation masks at 22 frames per second. The model code and pre-trained models are made available: https://github.com/dimitrisPs/msdesis.",0
165,Spontaneous diaphragmatic rupture following robotic prostatectomy,"Robotic surgery is an established therapy for localised prostate cancer and is replacing conventional laparoscopic prostatectomy in developed countries.

166,Remote Magnetic Navigation for Catheter Ablation in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease: A Review,"In patients with congenital heart disease, challenges to catheter-based arrhythmia interventions are unique and numerous given the complexity of the underlying defects, anatomic and surgical intervention variants including baffles, conduits, patches, and/or shunts. Remote magnetic navigation offers significant advantages in these cases that may present with limited vascular access or difficult access to the target cardiac chambers implicated by the previous surgical interventions. We reviewed the data available on the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of magnetic navigation for the treatment of arrhythmia in congenital heart disease and discussed the specific challenges related to various congenital defects and repair with the potential advantages offered by magnetic navigation in these circumstances.",0
167,Use of a robotic camera holder (FreeHand®) for laparoscopic appendicectomy,"Introduction: Use of a mechanical arm to hold the laparoscopic camera has many advantages. FreeHand® (FreeHand Ltd, Guildford, United Kingdom) is a robotic camera holder which uses head movement and infrared technology. This trial assessed the usefulness of FreeHand® in laparoscopic appendicectomy.Material and methods: This was a single center prospective cohort study on patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy using FreeHand®. Patient demographics, operative details, conversion to human camera holder and surgeon discomfort were recorded. Utilization of assistant time while not assisting was also recorded.Results: Twenty-two participants were included, with a mean age of 32 years and a mean BMI of 25.3. The mean set up time was nine minutes. There were five conversions to a manual camera holder (22.7%). There were 22 lens cleaning episodes with nine (40.9%) not requiring any lens cleaning and six (27.3%) requiring one clean. There were no peri-operative complications. Most surgeons reported minimal or no discomfort. Assistant's time was used for ward work (57%), clerking patients (36%) and for a break (7%).Conclusions: FreeHand® can be safely used in laparoscopic appendicectomy. It provides a stable image, puts the surgeon in control of the surgical field, causes minimal user discomfort, and frees up personnel.",1
168,Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA),"Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are an important cause of morbidity and are frequently associated with poor prognosis, particularly in high-risk patients. The cornerstones in the management of complicated IAIs are timely effective source control with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is important in the management of intra-abdominal infections and must be broad enough to cover all likely organisms because inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is associated with poor patient outcomes and the development of bacterial resistance. The overuse of antimicrobials is widely accepted as a major driver of some emerging infections (such as C. difficile), the selection of resistant pathogens in individual patients, and for the continued development of antimicrobial resistance globally. The growing emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms and the limited development of new agents available to counteract them have caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, especially with regards to Gram-negative bacteria. An international task force from 79 different countries has joined this project by sharing a document on the rational use of antimicrobials for patients with IAIs. The project has been termed AGORA (Antimicrobials: A Global Alliance for Optimizing their Rational Use in Intra-Abdominal Infections). The authors hope that AGORA, involving many of the world's leading experts, can actively raise awareness in health workers and can improve prescribing behavior in treating IAIs.",0
169,Validity assessment of a simulation module for robot-assisted thoracic lobectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Training for robot-assisted thoracic lobectomy remains an issue, prompting the development of virtual reality simulators. Our aim was to assess the construct and face validity of a new thoracic lobectomy module on the RobotiX Mentor, a robotic surgery simulator. We also aimed to determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementation into training.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This prospective, observational, and comparative study recruited novice (n = 16), intermediate (n = 9), and expert (n = 5) participants from King's College London, the 25th European Conference on General Thoracic Surgery, and the Society of Robotic Surgery conference 2018. Each participant completed two familiarization tasks followed by the Guided Robotic Lobectomy module and an evaluation questionnaire. Outcome measures were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Construct validity was demonstrated in 12/21 performance evaluation metrics. Significant differences between groups were found in all metrics including: time taken to complete module, vascular injury, respect for tissue, number of stapler firings, time instruments out of view, number of instrument collisions, and number of movements. Participants deemed aspects of the simulator (mean 3/5) and module (3/5) as realistic and rated the simulator as both acceptable (3.8/5) and feasible (3.8/5) for robotic surgical training.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Face validity, acceptability, and feasibility were established for the thoracic lobectomy module of the RobotiX Mentor simulator. Moderate evidence of construct validity was also demonstrated. With further work, this simulation module could help to reduce the initial part of the learning curve for trainees and decrease the risk of errors during live training.",3

171,Evaluation of a novel flexible snake robot for endoluminal surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Endoluminal therapeutic procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection are increasingly attractive given the shift in surgical paradigm towards minimally invasive surgery. This novel three-channel articulated robot was developed to overcome the limitations of the flexible endoscope which poses a number of challenges to endoluminal surgery. The device enables enhanced movement in a restricted workspace, with improved range of motion and with the accuracy required for endoluminal surgery.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate a novel flexible robot for therapeutic endoluminal surgery.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Bench-top studies.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Research laboratory.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Targeting and navigation tasks of the robot were performed to explore the range of motion and retroflexion capabilities. Complex endoluminal tasks such as endoscopic mucosal resection were also simulated.
    


          Main outcome measurements:
        
      
      Successful completion, accuracy and time to perform the bench-top tasks were the main outcome measures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The robot ranges of movement, retroflexion and navigation capabilities were demonstrated. The device showed significantly greater accuracy of targeting in a retroflexed position compared to a conventional endoscope.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Bench-top study and small study sample.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We were able to demonstrate a number of simulated endoscopy tasks such as navigation, targeting, snaring and retroflexion. The improved accuracy of targeting whilst in a difficult configuration is extremely promising and may facilitate endoluminal surgery which has been notoriously challenging with a conventional endoscope.",1
172,The Influence of Culture on Attitudes Towards Humanoid and Animal-like Robots: An Integrative Review,"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of the present review is to explore the influence of culture on attitudes towards humanoid and animal-like robots.
    


          Design:
        
      
      An integrative review of current evidence.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched from 2000 to 2017. A total of 22 articles met the inclusion criteria and were retrieved and analyzed.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Culture influences attitudes and preferences towards robots, but due to the limitations of the reviewed studies, concrete conclusions cannot be made. More consistent evidence was found with regard to the influence of culture on nonverbal behaviors and communication styles, with people being more accepting of a robot that behaved more closely to their own culture.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The research field of human-robot interaction provides the current evidence on the influence that culture has on attitudes towards humanoid and animal-like robots, but more research that is guided by strong theoretical frameworks is needed.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      With the increased use of humanoid robots in the healthcare system, it is imperative that nurses and other healthcare professionals explore and understand the different factors that can affect the use of robots with patients.",7
173,Propensity Score-Matched Analysis Comparing Robotic and Laparoscopic Right and Extended Right Hepatectomy,"Importance:
        
      
      Laparoscopic and robotic techniques have both been well adopted as safe options in selected patients undergoing hepatectomy. However, it is unknown whether either approach is superior, especially for major hepatectomy such as right hepatectomy or extended right hepatectomy (RH/ERH).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the outcomes of robotic vs laparoscopic RH/ERH.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      In this case-control study, propensity score matching analysis was performed to minimize selection bias. Patients undergoing robotic or laparoscopic RH/EHR at 29 international centers from 2008 to 2020 were included.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Robotic vs laparoscopic RH/ERH.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and short-term perioperative outcomes were collected and analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 989 individuals who met study criteria, 220 underwent robotic and 769 underwent laparoscopic surgery. The median (IQR) age in the robotic RH/ERH group was 61.00 (51.86-69.00) years and in the laparoscopic RH/ERH group was 62.00 (52.03-70.00) years. Propensity score matching resulted in 220 matched pairs for further analysis. Patients' demographics and tumor characteristics were comparable in the matched cohorts. Robotic RH/ERH was associated with a lower open conversion rate (19 of 220 [8.6%] vs 39 of 220 [17.1%]; P = .01) and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (median [IQR], 7.0 [5.0-10.0] days; mean [SD], 9.11 [7.52] days vs median [IQR], 7.0 [5.75-10.0] days; mean [SD], 9.94 [8.99] days; P = .048). On subset analysis of cases performed between 2015 and 2020 after a center's learning curve (50 cases), robotic RH/ERH was associated with a shorter postoperative hospital stay (median [IQR], 6.0 [5.0-9.0] days vs 7.0 [6.0-9.75] days; P = .04) with a similar conversion rate (12 of 220 [7.6%] vs 17 of 220 [10.8%]; P = .46).
    


          Conclusion and relevance:
        
      
      Robotic RH/ERH was associated with a lower open conversion rate and shorter postoperative hospital stay compared with laparoscopic RH/ERH. The difference in open conversion rate was associated with a significant decrease for laparoscopic but not robotic RH/ERH after a center had mounted the learning curve. Use of robotic platform may help to overcome the initial challenges of minimally invasive RH/ERH.",9
174,Transoral robotic surgery for recurrent cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract-Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for recurrent head and neck (H&N) cancer is an emerging but relatively infrequent procedure.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting survival data and functional outcomes for patients undergoing TORS for previously treated H&N cancers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight hundred seventy-eight records were identified, of which eight were eligible for inclusion, covering 161 cases (range 1-64). The pooled rates were as follows: 2-year overall survival 73.8% (4 studies, range 70.6-75.0, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 65.4 to 81.5, [I2 0.0%, P = 1.0]); 2-year disease-free survival 74.8% (4 studies, range 56.2-92.0, 95% CI 63.3 to 84.8, [I2 36.9%, P = .2]); postoperative hemorrhage 9.3% (4 studies, range 3.3-13.3, 95% CI 4.7 to 15.1, [I2 0.0%, P = .5]).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Functional and oncological outcomes are favorable, although the follow-up is limited in the literature. Larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed for definitive conclusions to be drawn.",1
175,Robotic Lateral Pancreaticojejunostomy for Chronic Pancreatitis,"Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) has shown good postoperative outcomes in patients with painful, morphine dependent, chronic pancreatitis (CP). The recent rise of robotic and laparoscopic pancreatic surgery has found benefits such as reduced time to functional recovery. Few studies have reported on the feasibility, technique and outcome of robotic LPJ, especially including transection of the gastroduodenal artery. The present study describes the main steps for robotic LPJ in a patient with painful chronic pancreatitis with a dilated main pancreatic duct. The patient underwent robotic LPJ. The LPJ anastomosis is performed using a running suture technique in a longitudinal side-to-side manner. Routinely, the gastroduodenal artery is transected to drain the entire length of the main pancreatic duct. The patient is in French position; 7 trocars are placed (4 robotic, 2 laparoscopic assistants, 1 liver-retractor). After docking of the robot system, the omental bursa is opened, and the right gastroepiploic artery and vein are ligated at their base at the lower border of the pancreas. Intraoperative ultrasonography is performed in order to determine trajectory of the dilated main pancreatic duct which is opened for its entire length after the gastroduodenal artery has been suture ligated both cranially and caudally from the main pancreatic duct. A Roux limb is created, and a latero-lateral PJ is fashioned using several 3-0 barbed sutures. A stapled jejuno-jejunostomy is created at sufficient distance from the pancreatic anastomosis, aided by a 50 cm suture. The described technique for robotic LPJ is a complex but feasible operation for patients with treatment refractory CP and a dilated main pancreatic duct. Due to its complexity, implementation in high volume centers with extensive experience with CP surgery may improve outcomes.",2
176,Antibiotic Treatment and Appendectomy for Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis in Adults and Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize the current available evidence on nonoperative management (NOM) with antibiotics for uncomplicated appendicitis, both in adults and children.
    


          Summary background data:
        
      
      Although earlier meta-analyses demonstrated that NOM with antibiotics may be an acceptable treatment strategy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, evidence is limited by conflicting results.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE databases for randomized and nonrandomized studies comparing antibiotic therapy (AT) and surgical therapy-appendectomy (ST) for uncomplicated appendicitis. Literature search was completed in August 2018.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty studies comparing AT and ST qualified for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis. In total, 3618 patients were allocated to AT (n = 1743) or ST (n = 1875). Higher complication-free treatment success rate (82.3% vs 67.2%; P < 0.00001) and treatment efficacy based on 1-year follow-up rate (93.1% vs 72.6%; P < 0.00001) were reported for ST. Index admission antibiotic treatment failure and rate of recurrence at 1-year follow-up were reported in 8.5% and 19.2% of patients treated with antibiotics, respectively. Rates of complicated appendicitis with peritonitis identified at the time of surgical operation (AT: 21.7% vs ST: 12.8%; P = 0.07) and surgical complications (AT: 12.8% vs ST: 13.6%; P = 0.66) were equivalent.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Antibiotic therapy could represent a feasible treatment option for image-proven uncomplicated appendicitis, although complication-free treatment success rates are higher with ST. There is also evidence that NOM for uncomplicated appendicitis does not statistically increase the perforation rate in adult and pediatric patients receiving antibiotic treatment. NOM with antibiotics may fail during the primary hospitalization in about 8% of cases, and an additional 20% of patients might need a second hospitalization for recurrent appendicitis.",2
177,Emergency surgery for splenic flexure cancer: results of the SFC Study Group database,"Background:
        
      
      The effectiveness of surgical treatment for splenic flexure carcinomas (SFCs) in emergency settings remains unexplored. This study aims to compare the perioperative and long-term outcomes of different alternatives for emergency SFC resection.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This multicenter retrospective study was based on the SFC Study Group database. For the present analysis, SFC patients were selected if they had received emergency surgical resection with curative intent between 2000 and 2018. Extended right colectomy (ERC), left colectomy (LC), and segmental left colectomy (SLC) were evaluated and compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study sample was composed of 90 SFC patients who underwent emergency ERC (n = 55, 61.1%), LC (n = 18, 20%), or SLC (n = 17, 18.9%). Bowel obstruction was the most frequent indication for surgery (n = 75, 83.3%), and an open approach was chosen in 81.1% of the patients. A higher incidence of postoperative complications was observed in the ERC group (70.9%) than in the LC (44.4%) and SLC groups (47.1%), with a significant procedure-related difference for severe postoperative complications (Dindo-Clavien ≥ III; adjusted odds ratio for ERC vs. LC:7.23; 95% CI 1.51-34.66; p = 0.013). Anastomotic leakage occurred in 8 (11.2%) patients, with no differences between the groups (p = 0.902). R0 resection was achieved in 98.9% of the procedures, and ≥ 12 lymph nodes were retrieved in 92.2% of patients. Overall and disease-free survival rates at 5 years were similar between the groups and were significantly associated with stage pT4 and the presence of synchronous metastases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the emergency setting, ERC and open surgery are the most frequently performed procedures. ERC is associated with increased odds of severe postoperative complications when compared to more conservative SFC resections. Nonetheless, all the alternatives seem to provide similar pathologic and long-term outcomes, supporting the oncological safety of more conservative resections for emergency SFCs.",9
178,A global horizon scan of the future impacts of robotics and autonomous systems on urban ecosystems,"Technology is transforming societies worldwide. A major innovation is the emergence of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), which have the potential to revolutionize cities for both people and nature. Nonetheless, the opportunities and challenges associated with RAS for urban ecosystems have yet to be considered systematically. Here, we report the findings of an online horizon scan involving 170 expert participants from 35 countries. We conclude that RAS are likely to transform land use, transport systems and human-nature interactions. The prioritized opportunities were primarily centred on the deployment of RAS for the monitoring and management of biodiversity and ecosystems. Fewer challenges were prioritized. Those that were emphasized concerns surrounding waste from unrecovered RAS, and the quality and interpretation of RAS-collected data. Although the future impacts of RAS for urban ecosystems are difficult to predict, examining potentially important developments early is essential if we are to avoid detrimental consequences but fully realize the benefits.",3
179,Diagnostic and prognostic factors in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review,"Objectives:
        
      
      As part of the PIONEER Consortium objectives, we have explored which diagnostic and prognostic factors (DPFs) are available in relation to our previously defined clinician and patient-reported outcomes for prostate cancer (PCa).
    


          Design:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review to identify validated and non-validated studies.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched on 21 January 2020.
    


          Eligibility criteria:
        
      
      Only quantitative studies were included. Single studies with fewer than 50 participants, published before 2014 and looking at outcomes which are not prioritised in the PIONEER core outcome set were excluded.
    


          Data extraction and synthesis:
        
      
      After initial screening, we extracted data following the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of prognostic factor studies (CHARMS-PF) criteria and discussed the identified factors with a multidisciplinary expert group. The quality of the included papers was scored for applicability and risk of bias using validated tools such as PROBAST, Quality in Prognostic Studies and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search identified 6604 studies, from which 489 DPFs were included. Sixty-four of those were internally or externally validated. However, only three studies on diagnostic and seven studies on prognostic factors had a low risk of bias and a low risk concerning applicability.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Most of the DPFs identified require additional evaluation and validation in properly designed studies before they can be recommended for use in clinical practice. The PIONEER online search tool for DPFs for PCa will enable researchers to understand the quality of the current research and help them design future studies.

180,Impact of tumor size on the difficulty of laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomies,"Introduction:
        
      
      Tumor size(TS) represents a critical parameter in the risk assessment of laparoscopic liver resections(LLR). Moreover, TS has been rarely related to the extent of liver resection. The aim of this study was to study the relationship between tumor size and difficulty of laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy( L-LLS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The impact of TS cutoffs was investigated by stratifying tumor size at each 10mm-interval. The optimal cut-offs were chosen taking into consideration the number of endpoints which show a statistically significant split around the cut-points of interest and the magnitude of relative risk after correction for multiple risk factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      1910 L-LLS were included. Overall, open conversion and intraoperative blood transfusion were 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. The major morbidity rate was 2.7% and 90-days mortality 0.6%. Three optimal TS cut-offs were identified: 40-mm, 70-mm, and 100-mm. All the selected cut-offs showed a significant discriminative power for the prediction of open conversion, operative time, blood transfusion and need of Pringle manoeuvre. Moreover, 70-mm and 100-mm cut-offs were both discriminative for estimated blood loss and major complications. A stepwise increase in rates of open conversion rate (Z=3.90,p<0.001), operative time (Z=3.84,p<0.001), blood loss (Z=6.50,p<0.001), intraoperative blood transfusion rate (Z=5.15,p<0.001), Pringle manoeuvre use (Z=6.48,p<0.001), major morbidity(Z=2.17,p=0.030) and 30-days readmission (Z=1.99, p=0.047) was registered as the size increased.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      L-LLS for tumours of increasing size was associated with poorer intraoperative and early postoperative outcomes suggesting increasing difficulty of the procedure. We determined 3 optimal TS cutoffs(40-mm, 70-mm and 100-mm) to accurately stratify surgical difficulty after L-LLS.",8
181,Accreditation and certification requirements for hernia centers and surgeons: the ACCESS project,"Introduction:
        
      
      There is a need for hernia centers and specialist hernia surgeons because of the increasing complexity of hernia surgery procedures due to new techniques, more difficult cases and a tailored approach with an increasing public awareness demanding optimal treatment results. Therefore, the requirements for accredited/certified hernia centers and specialist hernia surgeons should be formulated by the international and national hernia societies, while taking account of the respective health care systems.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The European Hernia Society (EHS) has appointed a working group composed of 18 hernia experts from all regions of Europe (ACCESS Group-Hernia Accreditation and Certification of Centers and Surgeons-Working Group) to formulate scientifically based requirements for hernia centers and specialist hernia surgeons while taking into consideration different health care systems. A consensus was reached on the key questions by means of a meeting, a telephone conference and the exchange of contributions. The requirements formulated below were deemed implementable by all participating hernia experts in their respective countries.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ACCESS Group suggests for an adequately equipped hernia center the following requirements: (a) to be accredited/certified by a national or international hernia society, (b) to perform a higher case volume in all types of hernia surgery compared to an average general surgery department in their country, (c) to be staffed by experienced hernia surgeons who are beyond the learning curve for all types of hernia surgery recommended in the guidelines and are responsible for education and training of hernia surgery in their department, (d) to treat hernia patients according to the current guidelines and scientific recommendations, (e) to document each case prospectively in a registry or quality assurance database (f) to perform follow-up for comparison of their own results with benchmark data for continuous improvement of their treatment results and ensuring contribution to research in hernia treatment. To become a specialist hernia surgeon, the ACCESS Group suggests a general surgeon to master the learning curve of all open and laparo-endoscopic hernia procedures recommended in the guidelines, perform a high caseload and additionally to implement and fulfill the other requirements for a hernia center.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Based on the above requirements formulated by the European Hernia Society for accredited/certified hernia centers and hernia specialist surgeons, the national and international hernia societies can now develop their own programs, while taking account of their specific health care systems.",3
182,A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis,"Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the most appropriate diagnostic tool to confirm suspected left colonic diverticulitis. However, the utility of CT imaging goes beyond accurate diagnosis of diverticulitis; the grade of severity on CT imaging may drive treatment planning of patients presenting with acute diverticulitis. The appropriate management of left colon acute diverticulitis remains still debated because of the vast spectrum of clinical presentations and different approaches to treatment proposed. The authors present a new simple classification system based on both CT scan results driving decisions making management of acute diverticulitis that may be universally accepted for day to day practice.",0
183,International multicentre propensity score-matched analysis comparing robotic versus laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive right posterior sectionectomy (RPS) is a technically challenging procedure. This study was designed to determine outcomes following robotic RPS (R-RPS) and laparoscopic RPS (L-RPS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An international multicentre retrospective analysis of patients undergoing R-RPS versus those who had purely L-RPS at 21 centres from 2010 to 2019 was performed. Patient demographics, perioperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were analysed retrospectively from a central database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed, with analysis of 1 : 2 and 1 : 1 matched cohorts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three-hundred and forty patients, including 96 who underwent R-RPS and 244 who had L-RPS, met the study criteria and were included. The median operating time was 295 minutes and there were 25 (7.4 per cent) open conversions. Ninety-seven (28.5 per cent) patients had cirrhosis and 56 (16.5 per cent) patients required blood transfusion. Overall postoperative morbidity rate was 22.1 per cent and major morbidity rate was 6.8 per cent. The median postoperative stay was 6 days. After 1 : 1 matching of 88 R-RPS and L-RPS patients, median (i.q.r.) blood loss (200 (100-400) versus 450 (200-900) ml, respectively; P < 0.001), major blood loss (> 500 ml; P = 0.001), need for intraoperative blood transfusion (10.2 versus 23.9 per cent, respectively; P = 0.014), and open conversion rate (2.3 versus 11.4 per cent, respectively; P = 0.016) were lower in the R-RPS group. Similar results were found in the 1 : 2 matched groups (66 R-RPS versus 132 L-RPS patients).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      R-RPS and L-RPS can be performed in expert centres with good outcomes in well selected patients. R-RPS was associated with reduced blood loss and lower open conversion rates than L-RPS.",5
184,Alignment in total knee arthroplasty,"Dissatisfaction following total knee arthroplasty is a well-documented phenomenon. Although many factors have been implicated, including modifiable and nonmodifiable patient factors, emphasis over the past decade has been on implant alignment and stability as both a cause of, and a solution to, this problem. Several alignment targets have evolved with a proliferation of techniques following the introduction of computer and robotic-assisted surgery. Mechanical alignment targets may achieve mechanically-sound alignment while ignoring the soft tissue envelope; kinematic alignment respects the soft tissue envelope while ignoring the mechanical environment. Functional alignment is proposed as a hybrid technique to allow mechanically-sound, soft tissue-friendly alignment targets to be identified and achieved.

185,"Identifying key outcome metrics in pancreatic surgery, and how to optimally achieve them","Background:
        
      
      Indicators of effectiveness and quality of care are of greatest importance in gauging the direct benefit of a new surgical technique, such as minimally-invasive pancreatic resections, when being compared with established approaches.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Current expert opinion on minimally-invasive pancreatic resection (MIPR) was presented at the first MIPR state of the art conference during 12th world congress of the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Studies exploring outcome of the minimally-invasive approach, alone or compared with open surgery, should consider all the necessary indicators of quality ensuring a high level of clinical care. Such studies should be implemented in a context that guarantees the correct indication for surgery, lower mortality rates, a low burden of post-operative morbidity through early recognition of adverse events and prevention of predictable complications, high standards of oncological ""radicality"", prompt recovery with access to adjuvant therapy as soon as possible, and reduction of health-care related costs.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Only by integrating MIPR with the outcome-improving effect of a dedicated pancreatic team will it be possible to assess more precisely the putative benefits of this minimally-invasive approach.",0
186,Robotics in neurointerventional surgery: a systematic review of the literature,"Background:
        
      
      Robotically performed neurointerventional surgery has the potential to reduce occupational hazards to staff, perform intervention with greater precision, and could be a viable solution for teleoperated neurointerventional procedures.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the indication, robotic systems used, efficacy, safety, and the degree of manual assistance required for robotically performed neurointervention.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review of the literature up to, and including, articles published on April 12, 2021. Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane register databases were searched using medical subject heading terms to identify reports of robotically performed neurointervention, including diagnostic cerebral angiography and carotid artery intervention.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 8 articles treating 81 patients were included. Only one case report used a robotic system for intracranial intervention, the remaining indications being cerebral angiography and carotid artery intervention. Only one study performed a comparison of robotic and manual procedures. Across all studies, the technical success rate was 96% and the clinical success rate was 100%. All cases required a degree of manual assistance. No studies had clearly defined patient selection criteria, reference standards, or index tests, preventing meaningful statistical analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Given the clinical success, it is plausible that robotically performed neurointerventional procedures will eventually benefit patients and reduce occupational hazards for staff; however, there is no high-level efficacy and safety evidence to support this assertion. Limitations of current robotic systems and the challenges that must be overcome to realize the potential for remote teleoperated neurointervention require further investigation.",1
187,Is robotic lobectomy cheaper? A micro-cost analysis,"Higher capital costs and operating room costs associated with Lobectomy via Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS) have previously been suggested as the principal contributors to the elevated overall cost. This study uses a micro-costing approach to a previous analysis of clinical outcomes of RATS, Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) and Open Lobectomy to evaluate the most significant cost drivers for the higher cost of robot-assisted lobectomy. A micro-costing model was developed to reflect the pathway of patients from day of surgery through the first 30 days following lobectomy. Costs were provided for RATS, VATS and Open approaches. Sensitivity analysis was performed specifically in the area of staff costs. A threshold sensitivity analysis of the overall cost components was also performed. Total cost per case for the RATS approach was €13,321 for the VATS approach €11,567, and for the Open approach €12,582. The overall cost differences were driven primarily by the elevated consumable costs associated with RATS Lobectomy. Capital costs account for a relatively small proportion of the per-case cost difference. This study presents a detailed analysis of the cost drivers for lobectomy, modelled for the three primary surgical approaches. We believe this is a useful tool for surgeons, hospital management, and service commissioning agencies to accurately and comprehensively determine where cost savings can be applied in their programme to improve the cost-effectiveness of RATS lobectomy.",3
188,"Comparison of robotic and manual implantation of intracerebral electrodes: a single-centre, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial","There has been a significant rise in robotic trajectory guidance devices that have been utilised for stereotactic neurosurgical procedures. These devices have significant costs and associated learning curves. Previous studies reporting devices usage have not undertaken prospective parallel-group comparisons before their introduction, so the comparative differences are unknown. We study the difference in stereoelectroencephalography electrode implantation time between a robotic trajectory guidance device (iSYS1) and manual frameless implantation (PAD) in patients with drug-refractory focal epilepsy through a single-blinded randomised control parallel-group investigation of SEEG electrode implantation, concordant with CONSORT statement. Thirty-two patients (18 male) completed the trial. The iSYS1 returned significantly shorter median operative time for intracranial bolt insertion, 6.36 min (95% CI 5.72-7.07) versus 9.06 min (95% CI 8.16-10.06), p = 0.0001. The PAD group had a better median target point accuracy 1.58 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.82) versus 1.16 mm (95% CI 1.01-1.33), p = 0.004. The mean electrode implantation angle error was 2.13° for the iSYS1 group and 1.71° for the PAD groups (p = 0.023). There was no statistically significant difference for any other outcome.

189,"The TransEnterix European Patient Registry for Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Procedures in Urology, Abdominal, Thoracic, and Gynecologic Surgery (""TRUST"")","Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic surgery was first introduced in the mid-1980s, and at the end of the '90s, the da Vinci® System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, California) was introduced in Europe and held a monopoly for years afterward. In 2016, Senhance™ digital laparoscopic platform (TransEnterix Inc., Morrisville, North Carolina) came to the market. This new platform is based on laparoscopic movements and is designed for laparoscopic surgeons. This study shows the surgical outcomes of patients after different visceral, colorectal, gynecological, and urological surgical procedures done with the Senhance™ digital laparoscopic platform with a focus on safety.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The study population consists of 871 patients who underwent robotic surgery with the Senhance™ platform. The most common procedures were hernia repairs (unilateral and bilateral), cholecystectomies, and prostatectomies. The procedures were performed in five centers in Europe between February 2017 and July 2020 by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.
    


          Results:
        
      
      220 (25.3 %) out of 871 patients had a unilateral hernia repair, 70 (8.0%) a bilateral hernia repair, 159 (18.3%) underwent a cholecystectomy, and 168 (19.3%) a prostatectomy. The other procedures included visceral, colorectal, and gynecological surgery procedures. The median docking time was 7.46 minutes for the four most common procedures. The duration of surgery varied from 32 to 313 minutes, the average time was 114.31 minutes. Adverse events were rare overall. There were 48 (5.5 %) adverse events out of 871 patients, 24 of them (2.8 % of all cases) were severe. Out of all 24 severe adverse events, five events (20.8%) were likely related to the robot, 17 events (70.8%) were unlikely related to the robot, and two events (8.3%) could not be categorized. Regarding complications following unilateral hernia repairs, data from 212 patients was available. Thirteen (6.1%) complications occurred, and six of those (2.8%) were serious. Out of 68 patients with a bilateral hernia repair, six patients (8.8%) developed complications, three of which were severe (4.4%). The complication rate was 2.8% in the patients following a cholecystectomy (4/144); two of them serious. After prostatectomy, six out of 141 patients (4.3 %) had complications; one serious (0.7%) No mortality was observed. Data about unplanned conversions to laparoscopic surgery could be collected from 761 patients which is a rate of 3.7%. There were 12 conversions out of 760 procedures to open surgery (1.6%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our series shows these procedures are safe and reproducible. The findings suggest that the surgical results after robotic surgery with the Senhance™ system are promising. Long-term data regarding complication rates should be the subject of future studies.",3
190,European association for endoscopic surgery (EAES) consensus statement on single-incision endoscopic surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Laparoscopic surgery changed the management of numerous surgical conditions. It was associated with many advantages over open surgery, such as decreased postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter hospital stay and excellent cosmesis. Since two decades single-incision endoscopic surgery (SIES) was introduced to the surgical community. SIES could possibly result in even better postoperative outcomes than multi-port laparoscopic surgery, especially concerning cosmetic outcomes and pain. However, the single-incision surgical procedure is associated with quite some challenges.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An expert panel of surgeons has been selected and invited to participate in the preparation of the material for a consensus meeting on the topic SIES, which was held during the EAES congress in Frankfurt, June 16, 2017. The material presented during the consensus meeting was based on evidence identified through a systematic search of literature according to a pre-specified protocol. Three main topics with respect to SIES have been identified by the panel: (1) General, (2) Organ specific, (3) New development. Within each of these topics, subcategories have been defined. Evidence was graded according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence. Recommendations were made according to the GRADE criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In general, there is a lack of high level evidence and a lack of long-term follow-up in the field of single-incision endoscopic surgery. In selected patients, the single-incision approach seems to be safe and effective in terms of perioperative morbidity. Satisfaction with cosmesis has been established to be the main advantage of the single-incision approach. Less pain after single-incision approach compared to conventional laparoscopy seems to be considered an advantage, although it has not been consistently demonstrated across studies.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Considering the increased direct costs (devices, instruments and operating time) of the SIES procedure and the prolonged learning curve, wider acceptance of the procedure should be supported only after demonstration of clear benefits.",0
191,Anaesthetic management for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: the first UK national survey of current practice,"Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is the most common robotic surgical procedure, but there are little published data to inform anaesthetic practice. We aimed to characterise the range of anaesthetic practice for RALP in the United Kingdom through a national survey. We conducted an online national survey to determine current anaesthetic practice for RALP. The survey was distributed to all NHS hospitals within the UK that perform RALP. Thirty-four (79%) of 43 hospitals responded to the survey. Fourteen (41%) centres routinely provide spinal anaesthesia and 79% of these use diamorphine as their intrathecal opioid of choice. Thirty-one (91%) centres administer intravenous strong opioids intraoperatively, and a wide range of non-opioid analgesic agents are also administered. Five (15%) centres reported that they discharge a minority of patients on the day of surgery. High-volume centres are more likely to have a formalised enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway and to provide ambulatory surgery for selected patients. This represents the first UK national survey of anaesthetic practice for RALP. The results of the survey revealed significant variation in anaesthetic practice implying a lack of consensus on best perioperative management.",2
192,WSES/GAIS/SIS-E/WSIS/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections,"Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and have been reported as major contributors to non-trauma deaths in hospitals worldwide. The cornerstones of effective treatment of IAIs include early recognition, adequate source control, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prompt physiologic stabilization using a critical care environment, combined with an optimal surgical approach. Together, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery (GAIS), the Surgical Infection Society-Europe (SIS-E), the World Surgical Infection Society (WSIS), and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) have jointly completed an international multi-society document in order to facilitate clinical management of patients with IAIs worldwide building evidence-based clinical pathways for the most common IAIs. An extensive non-systematic review was conducted using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases, limited to the English language. The resulting information was shared by an international task force from 46 countries with different clinical backgrounds. The aim of the document is to promote global standards of care in IAIs providing guidance to clinicians by describing reasonable approaches to the management of IAIs.",0
193,First-in-Human Robot-Assisted Subretinal Drug Delivery Under Local Anesthesia,"Purpose:
        
      
      To report the results of a first-in-human study using a robotic device to assist subretinal drug delivery in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery for macular hemorrhage.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Double-armed, randomized controlled surgical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03052881).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study was performed at the Oxford Eye Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom. In total, 12 participants were recruited-6 in the robot-assisted and 6 in the control manual surgery arm according to the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects presented with acute loss of vision owing to a subfoveal hemorrhage secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration. After standard vitrectomy, intraoperative optical coherence tomography-guided subretinal injection of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was performed by either robot-assisted or conventional manual technique under local anesthesia. The robotic part of the procedure involved advancement of a cannula through the retina and stabilizing it during foot-controlled injection of up to 100 µL of TPA solution. We assessed surgical success, duration of surgery, adverse events, and tolerability of surgery under local anesthesia.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The procedure was well tolerated by all participants and safely performed in all cases. Total duration of surgery, time taken to complete the injection, and retinal microtrauma were similar between the groups and not clinically significant. Subretinal hemorrhage was successfully displaced at 1 month postintervention, except for 1 control subject, and the median gain in visual acuity was similar in both arms.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This first-in-human study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of high-precision robot-assisted subretinal drug delivery as part of the surgical management of submacular hemorrhage, simulating its potential future application in gene or cell therapy.",0
194,The Influence of Distance and Lateral Offset of Follow Me Robots on User Perception,"Robots that are designed to work in close proximity to humans are required to move and act in a way that ensures social acceptance by their users. Hence, a robot's proximal behavior toward a human is a main concern, especially in human-robot interaction that relies on relatively close proximity. This study investigated how the distance and lateral offset of ""Follow Me"" robots influences how they are perceived by humans. To this end, a Follow Me robot was built and tested in a user study for a number of subjective variables. A total of 18 participants interacted with the robot, with the robot's lateral offset and distance varied in a within-subject design. After each interaction, participants were asked to rate the movement of the robot on the dimensions of comfort, expectancy conformity, human likeness, safety, trust, and unobtrusiveness. Results show that users generally prefer robot following distances in the social space, without a lateral offset. However, we found a main influence of affinity for technology, as those participants with a high affinity for technology preferred closer following distances than participants with low affinity for technology. The results of this study show the importance of user-adaptiveness in human-robot-interaction.",4
195,Introduction of robot-assisted radical cystectomy within an established enhanced recovery programme,"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe the implementation phase of a robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) programme including side-effect profiles and impact on length of stay (LOS).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      In all, 114 consecutive patients (82% male) underwent RARC and urinary diversion between April 2013 and December 2015 [ileal conduit (97 patients) and orthotopic neobladder (17)]. Surgery was performed by two surgeons within a designated regional cancer centre. No exclusion criteria were applied. All patients were managed on the Exeter Enhanced Recovery Pathway (ERP) in a unit where embedded enhanced recovery practice was already established. Data were collected prospectively on the national cystectomy registry - the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Complex Operations Dataset.
    


          Results:
        
      
      RARC was technically feasible in all but one case. The mean operating time was 3-5 h with an overall transfusion rate of 8.8%. There were higher-grade complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV) in 18.4% of patients, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9%. The median (range) LOS after RARC was 7 (3-68) days, with a re-admission rate of 18.4%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present series shows that RARC can be safely implemented in a unit experienced in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Case-selection in this setting is not deemed necessary. There are benefits in terms of lower transfusion rates and reduced LOS. The side-effect profile appears to differ from that of open RC, and despite the fact that complication rate is equivalent; 'technical' complications are over-represented in the RAS group. As such, they should improve with experience, recognition, and modification of surgical technique. ERPs can be safely applied to all patients undergoing RARC to maximise the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.",2
196,Autonomous surgery in the era of robotic urology: friend or foe of the future surgeon?,"Despite advances in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) in the past two decades, control of the robotic system currently remains under the command of a human surgeon. Historically, urology has pioneered new surgical techniques and technologies. Now, autonomous RAS is on the horizon and the first data from clinical trials of autonomous RAS in urology are being published. Automation takes control away from the surgeon but promises standardization of techniques, increased efficiency, potentially reduced complication rates and new ways of integrating intra-operative imaging. Preclinical and clinical evidence is emerging that supports the use of autonomous robotic-assisted urological surgery. Use of autonomous technologies in the operating theatre will directly affect the role of the urological surgeon. Integration of autonomous RAS can be viewed as a positive aid, but it might also be perceived as a threat to the future urological surgeon.",3
197,da Vinci robot-assisted keyhole neurosurgery: a cadaver study on feasibility and safety,"The goal of this cadaver study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of da Vinci robot-assisted keyhole neurosurgery. Several keyhole craniotomies were fashioned including supraorbital subfrontal, retrosigmoid and supracerebellar infratentorial. In each case, a simple durotomy was performed, and the flap was retracted. The da Vinci surgical system was then used to perform arachnoid dissection towards the deep-seated intracranial cisterns. It was not possible to simultaneously pass the 12-mm endoscope and instruments through the keyhole craniotomy in any of the approaches performed, limiting visualization. The articulated instruments provided greater dexterity than existing tools, but the instrument arms could not be placed in parallel through the keyhole craniotomy and, therefore, could not be advanced to the deep cisterns without significant clashing. The da Vinci console offered considerable ergonomic advantages over the existing operating room arrangement, allowing the operating surgeon to remain non-sterile and seated comfortably throughout the procedure. However, the lack of haptic feedback was a notable limitation. In conclusion, while robotic platforms have the potential to greatly enhance the performance of transcranial approaches, there is strong justification for research into next-generation robots, better suited to keyhole neurosurgery.",1
198,Robot-assisted salvage seminal vesicle excision for isolated recurrence after low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy,"Objectives:
        
      
      To report clinical and functional outcomes for patients who have undergone salvage robot-assisted seminal vesicle excision (RA-SVE) for the focal treatment of isolated seminal vesical (SV) recurrence after treatment for prostate cancer by low-dose-rate brachytherapy.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDR-PB) underwent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) of the prostate and 11 C-Choline or 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, followed by targeted transperineal biopsy of the prostate and SVs. Isolated SV recurrence were identified in 17 (0.38%) LDR-PB patients. These 17 patients were offered RA-SVE.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median total operative time was 90 min and blood loss 50 mL with no postoperative transfusions required. The median hospital stay was 1 day. No intra- or postoperative complications were documented. Continence status was unaffected, no patient required urinary pads. Postoperative pathology confirmed SV invasion in all specimens. Surgical margins were positive in seven (41%) patients. All patients had at least one positive imaging study, although three (18%) mp-MRI and five (29%) PET/CT assessments were negative. One (6%) pre-SVE biopsy was also negative but with positive imaging. Salvage SVE failure, defined as three consecutive PSA rises or the need for further treatment, occurred in six patients of whom three had a positive margin. Overall failure-free survival rates were 86%, 67%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 3 years after SVE, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Salvage RA-SVE appears to be a safe focal treatment, with very low morbidity, for patients with localised SV recurrence after LDR-PB. It permits deferral of androgen deprivation therapy in selected patients. Bilateral SVE is mandatory. This surgical option should be considered in patients with isolated prostate cancer recurrence to the SV.",1
199,A Developmental Cognitive Architecture for Trust and Theory of Mind in Humanoid Robots,"As artificial systems are starting to be widely deployed in real-world settings, it becomes critical to provide them with the ability to discriminate between different informants and to learn from reliable sources. Moreover, equipping an artificial agent to infer beliefs may improve the collaboration between humans and machines in several ways. In this article, we propose a hybrid cognitive architecture, called Thrive, with the purpose of unifying in a computational model recent discoveries regarding the underlying mechanism involved in trust. The model is based on biological observations that confirmed the role of the midbrain in trial-and-error learning, and on developmental studies that indicate how essential is a theory of mind in order to build empathetic trust. Thrive is build on top of an actor-critic framework that is used to stabilize the weights of two self-organizing maps. A Bayesian network embeds prior knowledge into an intrinsic environment, providing a measure of cost that is used to boostrap learning without an external reward signal. Following a developmental robotics approach, we embodied the model in the iCub humanoid robot and we replicated two psychological experiments. The results are in line with real data, and shed some light on the mechanisms involved in trust-based learning in children and robots.",4
200,Fear of innovation: public's perception of robotic surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic surgery is used in several surgical procedures with limited evidence of clinical benefit. In some jurisdictions, the demand for robotic surgery may have been fueled by public perception of this novel technology. Therefore, we sought to investigate the public's perception of robotic surgery.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a series of vignette-associated questions designed to examine the public's perception of robotic surgery. Eligible participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk's system and randomized to one of two pairs of vignettes: laparoscopic surgery compared to (1) robotic surgery, or (2) ""novel surgical technology"" (without using the term ""robotic""). Outcomes of interest were anticipated postoperative outcomes using the surgical fear questionnaire, procedure preference, perception of error, trust, and competency of the surgeon.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survey included 362 respondents; 64.1% were male with median age of 53 years. There were no differences in the distribution of responses of the questionnaire based on use of the term ""robotic"" or ""novel surgical technology""; therefore, the two cohorts were combined to examine perception of robotic compared to laparoscopic surgery. More respondents feared outcomes of robotic surgery than laparoscopic surgery (78.2% vs 14.9%, p < 0.001). Participants preferred laparoscopic to robotic surgery (64.4% vs 35.6%, p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The public fears recovery after robotic surgery and prefers laparoscopic surgery. The propagation of robotic surgery is unlikely based on public demand and may be more related to institutional or surgeon perceptions. Surgeons who provide robotic surgery should ensure their patients are comfortable with and understand this technology.",3
201,Effect of Robot-Assisted Radical Cystectomy With Intracorporeal Urinary Diversion vs Open Radical Cystectomy on 90-Day Morbidity and Mortality Among Patients With Bladder Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance:
        
      
      Robot-assisted radical cystectomy is being performed with increasing frequency, but it is unclear whether total intracorporeal surgery improves recovery compared with open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To compare recovery and morbidity after robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal reconstruction vs open radical cystectomy.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Randomized clinical trial of patients with nonmetastatic bladder cancer recruited at 9 sites in the UK, from March 2017-March 2020. Follow-up was conducted at 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months, with final follow-up on September 23, 2021.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants were randomized to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal reconstruction (n = 169) or open radical cystectomy (n = 169).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital within 90 days of surgery. There were 20 secondary outcomes, including complications, quality of life, disability, stamina, activity levels, and survival. Analyses were adjusted for the type of diversion and center.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 338 randomized participants, 317 underwent radical cystectomy (mean age, 69 years; 67 women [21%]; 107 [34%] received neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 282 [89%] underwent ileal conduit reconstruction); the primary outcome was analyzed in 305 (96%). The median number of days alive and out of the hospital within 90 days of surgery was 82 (IQR, 76-84) for patients undergoing robotic surgery vs 80 (IQR, 72-83) for open surgery (adjusted difference, 2.2 days [95% CI, 0.50-3.85]; P = .01). Thromboembolic complications (1.9% vs 8.3%; difference, -6.5% [95% CI, -11.4% to -1.4%]) and wound complications (5.6% vs 16.0%; difference, -11.7% [95% CI, -18.6% to -4.6%]) were less common with robotic surgery than open surgery. Participants undergoing open surgery reported worse quality of life vs robotic surgery at 5 weeks (difference in mean European Quality of Life 5-Dimension, 5-Level instrument scores, -0.07 [95% CI, -0.11 to -0.03]; P = .003) and greater disability at 5 weeks (difference in World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 scores, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.15-0.73]; P = .003) and at 12 weeks (difference in WHODAS 2.0 scores, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.09-0.68]; P = .01); the differences were not significant after 12 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in cancer recurrence (29/161 [18%] vs 25/156 [16%] after robotic and open surgery, respectively) and overall mortality (23/161 [14.3%] vs 23/156 [14.7%]), respectively) at median follow-up of 18.4 months (IQR, 12.8-21.1).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Among patients with nonmetastatic bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, treatment with robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion vs open radical cystectomy resulted in a statistically significant increase in days alive and out of the hospital over 90 days. However, the clinical importance of these findings remains uncertain.

202,Development and evaluation of design guidelines for cognitive ergonomics in human-robot collaborative assembly systems,"Industry 4.0 is the concept used to summarize the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is profoundly changing the manufacturing systems and business models all over the world. Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.",1
203,"Ventilation and outcomes following robotic-assisted abdominal surgery: an international, multicentre observational study","Background:
        
      
      International data on the epidemiology, ventilation practice, and outcomes in patients undergoing abdominal robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) are lacking. The aim of the study was to assess the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), and to describe ventilator management after abdominal RAS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an international, multicentre, prospective study in 34 centres in nine countries. Patients ≥18 yr of age undergoing abdominal RAS were enrolled between April 2017 and March 2019. The Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) score was used to stratify for higher risk of PPCs (≥26). The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs. Secondary endpoints included the preoperative risk for PPCs and ventilator management.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1167 subjects screened, 905 abdominal RAS patients were included. Overall, 590 (65.2%) patients were at increased risk for PPCs. Meanwhile, 172 (19%) patients sustained PPCs, which occurred more frequently in 132 (22.4%) patients at increased risk, compared with 40 (12.7%) patients at lower risk of PPCs (absolute risk difference: 12.2% [95% confidence intervals (CI), 6.8-17.6%]; P<0.001). Plateau and driving pressures were higher in patients at increased risk, compared with patients at low risk of PPCs, but no ventilatory variables were independently associated with increased occurrence of PPCs. Development of PPCs was associated with a longer hospital stay.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      One in five patients developed one or more PPCs (chiefly unplanned oxygen requirement), which was associated with a longer hospital stay. No ventilatory variables were independently associated with PPCs.

205,When Does Da Vanci Robotic Surgical Systems Come Into Play?,"The emergent of medical science and technology has risen the minimally invasive surgery. Da Vinci Robotic Surgical Systems (RSS) is the trend at present. Compared with the past surgical methods, many studies related to RSS tend to explore postoperative outcomes and quality of life or compare the advantages and disadvantages than the other surgery. Few studies to understand the patients' willing who use RSS. This study mainly explores the patients' willingness and adopts the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the theoretical foundation, and appended the trust concept to discuss. The study was a retrospective study and used a structured questionnaire to conduct a survey. The subjects included the patients with single-disease who had used RSS in a Medical Center of Southern Taiwan but excluded the patients with multiple disorder. This study conducted SPSS 22.0 and Smart PLS 2.0 software for statistical analysis, which included descriptive statistical analysis and applied Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis to test the research model and to examine the established hypotheses. A total of 136 cases were collected in this study. Study validation was tested. Trust positively affects Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.550) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.300). Perceived Ease of Use positively affects Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.188). Perceived Usefulness positively affects Attitude Toward Using (β = 0.589. Attitude Toward Using positively affects Behavioral Intention (β = 0.446. The relationship between perceived Ease of Use and Attitude toward Using was insignificant. Additionally, the relationship between Perceived Usefulness and Behavioral Intention was insignificant. In the research results, we found that patients are mostly in the middle and high age groups, and if the patient himself feels that RSS is extremely helpful to his illness, the intensity of his choice of intention will be high. In comparison, the information related to RSS has been clearly known, it does not directly affect the selection intention. According to age, most of the choices of RSS is based on safety and risk considerations, and it is beneficial to the patient himself, but RSS is also more expensive. We recommended that the government consider ββ reimbursing the RSS process in health insurance programs to meet the needs and expectations of patients.",4
206,Delayed presentation of postcaesarean section vesicouterine fistula repaired robotically,"A premenopausal patient in her late forties presented with a 15-year history of urinary incontinence starting shortly after a caesarean section performed for her fourth delivery and more recently associated episodic light haematuria and passage of clots per vagina. The haematuria was intermittent over several months and associated with per-vaginal bleeding. She had symptomatic anaemia. Flexible cystoscopy and MRI showed a vesicouterine fistula. She underwent a robotic-assisted hysterectomy and multi-layered repair of the bladder with omental interposition. She remained in the hospital for 4 days, though recovered well and underwent catheter removal at 14 days following a normal cystogram. At 3 months, she was well with no incontinence or urinary symptoms. This case demonstrates the need for vigilance in assessing patients with persistent incontinence, particularly in the context of prior caesarean section. It highlights the feasibility of robotic surgery for correcting these defects in a society where minimally invasive surgery is becoming the norm, and cosmesis is a priority for patients.",0
207,The effect of facial features on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness in social robots,"As the nature of human-robot relationships have become increasingly bound to shift from supervisor-machine to friend-companion, people have exhibited an increasing interest in making social judgments toward such anthropomorphic objects, such as trustworthiness. However, the facial features of social robots and their potential effect on anthropomorphic trustworthiness are seldom analyzed and discussed comprehensively. This study examined whether the trustworthiness perception toward a social robot shared similarity with baby schema features on the human face. It also explored the effects of different combinations of baby schema facial features, especially the positions and sizes of the eyes and mouth, on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness. A 5-way mixed experiment (N = 270) was conducted accordingly. The results indicated that people would experience a high level of facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness toward robots with baby schema features (i.e., large eyes, with medium vertical and horizontal positions of the eyes and mouth). This paper contributes to the literature on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness in human-robot interaction and provides suggestions for social robot design.",4

The experiments are to test and evaluate different transparency levels and combinations of information in different channels of the in-vehicle robot, based on a driving simulator to collect subjective and objective data, which focuses on users' safety, usability, trust, and emotion dimensions under driving conditions. The results show that appropriate transparency expression is able to improve drivers' driving control and subjective evaluation and that drivers need a different amount of transparency information in different types of tasks.",4

210,"Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy After Focal Therapy: Oncological, Functional Outcomes and Predictors of Recurrence","There are few data on the outcomes and toxicity of radical prostatectomy (RP) among men experiencing local recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) following focal therapy (FT). To characterise perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes after salvage robot-assisted RP (S-RALP) and determine the risk factors for S-RALP failure, we conducted a multicentre cohort study of 82 patients undergoing S-RALP after FT. All had histological confirmation of PC recurrence, with metastatic disease excluded using pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, a bone scan, and/or positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Progression-free survival was 74%, 48%, and 36% at 12, 24, and 36mo after surgery, respectively. The 12-mo continence rate was 83%. There were no intraoperative complications and no major postoperative complications. On multivariable analysis, only infield recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-12.85; p=0.03) and pT3b stage (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.53-16.39; p=0.008) were independent predictors of recurrence. This study represents the largest series of salvage surgery after FT and shows that this approach is safe with no increase in toxicity when compared to primary RALP. Men identified as having infield recurrence after FT appear to have phenotypically aggressive disease and should be counselled regarding the potential need for a multimodal therapeutic approach. PATIENT SUMMARY: Robotic surgery after focal therapy for prostate cancer is safe and achieves postoperative continence results similar to those for robotic radical prostatectomy in treatment-naïve patients. However, if the cancer recurrence is within the previously treated field, the oncological prognosis seems to be worse.",0
211,Robotic Thyroid Surgery: Current Perspectives and Future Considerations,"Robotic transaxillary thyroidectomy, pioneered in South Korea, is firmly established throughout the Far East but remains controversial in Western practice. This relates to important population differences (anthropometry and culture) compounded by the smaller mean size of thyroid nodules operated on in South Korea due to a national thyroid cancer screening programme. There is now level 2 evidence (including from Western World centres) to support the safety, feasibility, and equivalence of the robotic approach to its open counterpart in terms of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism, haemorrhage, and oncological outcomes for differentiated thyroid cancer. Moreover, robotic thyroidectomy has been shown to be superior to open surgery for certain patient-reported outcome measures, namely scar cosmesis and pain. Downsides include its high cost, longer operative time, and risk of complications not encountered in open thyroidectomy (brachial plexus neurapraxia). Careful patient selection is paramount as this procedure is not for every patient, surgeon, or hospital. It should only be undertaken by high-volume surgeons operating as part of a multidisciplinary robotic team in specialised centres. Novel robotic approaches utilising the retroauricular and transoral routes for thyroidectomy have recently been described but further studies are required to establish their respective role in modern thyroid surgery.",2

      A cohort study of 629 593 men who underwent RP for localized prostate cancer at 449 hospitals in the USA from 2003 to 2013, using the Premier Hospital Database.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      RARP was ascertained through a review of the hospital charge description master for robotic supplies.
    


          Outcome measures and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Outcomes were 90-d postoperative complications (Clavien), blood product transfusions, operating room time (ORT), length of stay (LOS), and direct hospital costs. Propensity-weighted regression analyses accounting for clustering by hospitals and survey weighting ensured nationally representative estimates.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      RARP utilization rapidly increased from 1.8% in 2003 to 85% in 2013 (p<0.001). RARP patients (n=311 135) were less likely to experience any complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.68, p<0.001) or prolonged LOS (OR 0.28, p<0.001), or to receive blood products (OR 0.33, p=0.002) compared to ORP patients (n=318 458). The adjusted mean ORT was 131min longer for RARP (p=0.002). The 90-d direct hospital costs were higher for RARP (+$4528, p<0.001), primarily attributed to operating room and supplies costs. Costs were no longer signficantly different between ORP and RARP among the highest-volume surgeons (≥104 cases/yr; +$1990, p=0.40) and highest-volume hospitals (≥318 cases/yr; +$1225, p=0.39). Limitations include the lack of oncologic characteristics and the retrospective nature of the study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our contemporary analysis reveals that RARP confers a perioperative morbidity advantage at higher cost. In the absence of large randomized trials because of the widespread adoption of RARP, this retrospective study represents the best available evidence for the morbidity and cost profile of RARP versus ORP.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this large study of men with prostate cancer who underwent either open or robotic radical prostatectomy, we found that robotic surgery has a better morbidity profile but costs more.",5
213,Augmented-reality integrated robotics in neurosurgery: are we there yet?,"Surgical robots have captured the interest-if not the widespread acceptance-of spinal neurosurgeons. But successful innovation, scientific or commercial, requires the majority to adopt a new practice. ""Faster, better, cheaper"" products should in theory conquer the market, but often fail. The psychology of change is complex, and the ""follow the leader"" mentality, common in the field today, lends little trust to the process of disseminating new technology. Beyond product quality, timing has proven to be a key factor in the inception, design, and execution of new technologies. Although the first robotic surgery was performed in 1985, scant progress was seen until the era of minimally invasive surgery. This movement increased neurosurgeons' dependence on navigation and fluoroscopy, intensifying the drive for enhanced precision. Outside the field of medicine, various technology companies have made great progress in popularizing co-robots (""cobots""), augmented reality, and processor chips. This has helped to ease practicing surgeons into familiarity with and acceptance of these technologies. The adoption among neurosurgeons in training is a ""follow the leader"" phenomenon, wherein new surgeons tend to adopt the technology used during residency. In neurosurgery today, robots are limited to computers functioning between the surgeon and patient. Their functions are confined to establishing a trajectory for navigation, with task execution solely in the surgeon's hands. In this review, the authors discuss significant untapped technologies waiting to be used for more meaningful applications. They explore the history and current manifestations of various modern technologies, and project what innovations may lie ahead.",0
214,Robot-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy: Results from the EUROCRINE Surgical Registry,"Background:
        
      
      Adrenalectomy is routinely performed via the minimally invasive approach. Safety of adrenalectomy using the robot-assisted technique has been widely demonstrated by several series, but the literature is scarce regarding the comparison of conventional laparoscopic versus robot-assisted approach. We decided to carry out a multicenter study to compare clinical and surgical outcomes between laparoscopic and robotic adrenalectomy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a retrospective case-control study, including data from centers affiliated to the Surgical Registry EUROCRINE. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for adrenal tumors and registered between 2015 and 2018 were included. Robot-assisted versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy was compared. All comparisons were carried out in terms of complication rate, conversion rate and duration of stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,005 patients from 46 clinics underwent robotic or conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Median age was 55 (interquartile range: 45-65) years. Robotic adrenalectomy was performed in 189 (18.8%) patients. According to Clavien-Dindo classification, complication rate was lower in the robotic surgery group (1.6% vs 16.5%, P < .001). Laparoscopic surgery and active hormonal status were significantly correlated with complications, both in univariate and multivariate analysis. There was no significant difference between laparoscopic and robotic surgery groups, in terms of conversion rate (2.1% vs 0.5%, respectively, P = .147). Duration of stay was shorter in the robotic adrenalectomy group (82.1% vs 28.8%, P < .001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Analysis of the EUROCRINE database supports that robotic adrenalectomy resulted in a lower complication rate and shorter duration of stay, compared with laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Granular data to support this is warranted.",9
215,Minimally invasive surgery for pancreatic cancer,"Introduction: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for pancreatic cancer has become very popular in modern pancreatic surgery. Evidence of the benefits of an MI approach are increasing thanks to prospective studies and randomized controlled studies.Areas covered: Agreement is lacking regarding the oncological feasibility of MIS for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we performed a systematic review focusing on MIS for cancer of the head, body or tail of the pancreas. A total of 5237 studies were identified. After paper screening, 44 studies (22 on MI-pancreaticoduodenectomy and 22 on MI-distal pancreatectomy) met the eligibility criteria for the present review. The mean morbidity and mortality rates after MIPD were 31% and 4.9%, while overall complication and mortality rates were 32,5% and 1%. Median overall survival after MIPD and MIDP was 21.9 and 29.8 months, respectively. Both surgical and oncological outcomes were comparable to the open approach.Expert opinion: MIS offers advantages to the surgeon thanks to the high definition of the surgical field and the freedom of fine movement of the robot but should be considered only in selected patients and in high volume centers. Further studies are needed to prove the intraoperative and postoperative advantages of MIS compared to open surgery.",3
216,MEG-BMI to Control Phantom Limb Pain,"A brachial plexus root avulsion (BPRA) causes intractable pain in the insensible affected hands. Such pain is partly due to phantom limb pain, which is neuropathic pain occurring after the amputation of a limb and partial or complete deafferentation. Previous studies suggested that the pain was attributable to maladaptive plasticity of the sensorimotor cortex. However, there is little evidence to demonstrate the causal links between the pain and the cortical representation, and how much cortical factors affect the pain. Here, we applied lesioning of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZotomy) and training with a brain-machine interface (BMI) based on real-time magnetoencephalography signals to reconstruct affected hand movements with a robotic hand. The DREZotomy successfully reduced the shooting pain after BPRA, but a part of the pain remained. The BMI training successfully induced some plastic changes in the sensorimotor representation of the phantom hand movements and helped control the remaining pain. When the patient tried to control the robotic hand by moving their phantom hand through association with the representation of the intact hand, this especially decreased the pain while decreasing the classification accuracy of the phantom hand movements. These results strongly suggested that pain after the BPRA was partly attributable to cortical representation of phantom hand movements and that the BMI training controlled the pain by inducing appropriate cortical reorganization. For the treatment of chronic pain, we need to know how to modulate the cortical representation by novel methods.",6
217,"Combined effects of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation and transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on robot-assisted gait training in patients with chronic brain stroke: A pilot, single blind, randomized controlled trial","Background:
        
      
      Preliminary evidence showed additional effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the damaged cerebral hemisphere combined with cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation during robot-assisted gait training in chronic stroke patients. This is consistent with the neural organization of locomotion involving cortical and spinal control. The cerebellum is crucial for locomotor control, in particular for avoidance of obstacles, and adaptation to novel conditions during walking. Despite its key role in gait control, to date the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation of the cerebellum have not been investigated on brain stroke patients treated with robot-assisted gait training.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the effects of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation combined with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on robot-assisted gait training in patients with chronic brain stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      After balanced randomization, 20 chronic stroke patients received ten, 20-minute robot-assisted gait training sessions (five days a week, for two consecutive weeks) combined with central nervous system stimulation. Group 1 underwent on-line cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the contralesional cerebellar hemisphere + cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation. Group 2 received on-line anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the damaged cerebral hemisphere + cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation. The primary outcome was the 6-minute walk test performed before, after, and at follow-up at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The significant differences in the 6-minute walk test noted between groups at the first post-treatment evaluation (p = 0.041) were not maintained at either the 2-week (P = 0.650) or the 4-week (P = 0.545) follow-up evaluations.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the contralesional cerebellar hemisphere in combination with cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation might be useful to boost the effects of robot-assisted gait training in chronic brain stroke patients with walking impairment.",6
218,Exploring the differential effects of trust violations in human-human and human-robot interactions,"There is sparse research directly investigating the effects of trust manipulations in human-human and human-robot interactions. Moreover, studies on human-human versus human-robot trust have leveraged unusual or low vulnerability contexts to investigate such effects and have focused mostly on robot performance. In the present research, we seek to remedy these limitations and compare trust in human-human versus human-robot collaborations in an augmented and adapted version of the Trust Game. We used a mixed factorial design to examine the effects of trust and trust violations on human-human and human-robot interactions over time with an emphasis on anthropomorphic robots in a social context. We found consistent and significant effects of partner behavior. Specifically, partner distrust behaviors led to participants' lower levels of trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors over time compared to partner trust behaviors. We found no significant effect of partnering with a human versus an anthropomorphic robot over time across the three dependent variables, supporting the computers as social actors (CASA; Nass and Moon, 2000) paradigm. This study demonstrated that there may be instances where the effects of trust violations from an anthropomorphized robot partner are not meaningfully different from those of a human partner in a social context.",4
219,"Design of a Robotic Coach for Motor, Social and Cognitive Skills Training Toward Applications With ASD Children","Socially assistive robots may help the treatment of autism spectrum disorder(ASD), through games using dyadic interactions to train social skills. Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems.",4
220,Experience with detrusorotomy in children by open and robotic approach,"Purpose:
        
      
      To present the author's experience with detrusorotomy (DM) for refractory detrusor overactivity (RDO) with open and robotic approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Children who underwent DM for RDO in a single surgeon series since 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Those who completed the defined strict bladder cycling regime postoperatively were included in this report excluding those who failed the bladder cycling regime.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten children (M7: F3) were included in this report, six open and four robotic. All procedures were completed with no conversion to open in the robotic group. There were no intra or postoperative complications from the procedures. Duration of procedure was lower in robotic group (125 min) vs the open group at (208 min). Hospital stay was also lower in the robotic group (2.7 days) compared to the open group (5.6 days). All children in open group had concomitant Mitrofanoff channel created for bladder drainage. One child in robotic group had concomitant Mitrofanoff channel during DM. Median follow-up is longer at 54 months (31-82) in open group compared to 14 months (5-21). All children are clinically well with safe upper tracts on US scan in both series. Estimated % change in bladder capacity is similar in both groups at 140 (90-200) and 126 (80-200) for open and robotic groups, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      DM as an extension of medical treatment for RDO can be performed safely and is effective in children. Preliminary experience with robotic approach to DM is promising with reduced duration of procedure and hospital stay.",5
221,Robotic hand augmentation drives changes in neural body representation,"Humans have long been fascinated by the opportunities afforded through augmentation. This vision not only depends on technological innovations but also critically relies on our brain's ability to learn, adapt, and interface with augmentation devices. Here, we investigated whether successful motor augmentation with an extra robotic thumb can be achieved and what its implications are on the neural representation and function of the biological hand. Able-bodied participants were trained to use an extra robotic thumb (called the Third Thumb) over 5 days, including both lab-based and unstructured daily use. We challenged participants to complete normally bimanual tasks using only the augmented hand and examined their ability to develop hand-robot interactions. Participants were tested on a variety of behavioral and brain imaging tests, designed to interrogate the augmented hand's representation before and after the training. Training improved Third Thumb motor control, dexterity, and hand-robot coordination, even when cognitive load was increased or when vision was occluded. It also resulted in increased sense of embodiment over the Third Thumb. Consequently, augmentation influenced key aspects of hand representation and motor control. Third Thumb usage weakened natural kinematic synergies of the biological hand. Furthermore, brain decoding revealed a mild collapse of the augmented hand's motor representation after training, even while the Third Thumb was not worn. Together, our findings demonstrate that motor augmentation can be readily achieved, with potential for flexible use, reduced cognitive reliance, and increased sense of embodiment. Yet, augmentation may incur changes to the biological hand representation. Such neurocognitive consequences are crucial for successful implementation of future augmentation technologies.",4
222,How to report educational videos in robotic surgery: an international multidisciplinary consensus statement,"The swift endorsement of the robotic surgical platform indicates that it might prevail as the preferred technique for many complex abdominal and pelvic operations. Nonetheless, use of the surgical robotic system introduces further layers of complexity into the operating theatre necessitating new training models. Instructive videos with relevant exposition could be optimal for early training in robotic surgery and the aim of this study was to develop consensus guidelines on how to report a robotic surgery video for educational purposes to achieve high quality educational video outputs that could enhance surgical training. A steering group prepared a Delphi survey of 46 statements, which was distributed and voted on utilising an electronic survey tool. The selection of committee members was designed to include representative surgical trainers worldwide across different specialties, including lower and upper gastrointestinal surgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology. 36 consensus statements were approved and classified in seven categories: author's information and video introduction, case presentation, demonstration of the surgical procedure, outcomes of the procedure, associated educational content, review of surgical videos quality and use of surgical videos in educational curricula. Consensus guidelines on how to report robotic surgery videos for educational purposes have been elaborated utilising Delphi methodology. We recommend that adherence to the guidelines presented could support advancing the educational quality of video outputs when designed for training.",3
223,Do Privacy Concerns About Social Robots Affect Use Intentions? Evidence From an Experimental Vignette Study,"While the privacy implications of social robots have been increasingly discussed and privacy-sensitive robotics is becoming a research field within human-robot interaction, little empirical research has investigated privacy concerns about robots and the effect they have on behavioral intentions. To address this gap, we present the results of an experimental vignette study that includes antecedents from the privacy, robotics, technology adoption, and trust literature. Using linear regression analysis, with the privacy-invasiveness of a fictional but realistic robot as the key manipulation, we show that privacy concerns affect use intention significantly and negatively. Compared with earlier work done through a survey, where we found a robot privacy paradox, the experimental vignette approach allows for a more realistic and tangible assessment of respondents' concerns and behavioral intentions, showing how potential robot users take into account privacy as consideration for future behavior. We contextualize our findings within broader debates on privacy and data protection with smart technologies.",4
224,Peri-operative outcomes and complications after laparoscopic vs robot-assisted dismembered pyeloplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      To analyse the current difference between dismembered robot-assisted pyeloplasty (RAP) and laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) in the treatment of pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction as of 26 June 2017, focusing on operating time, length of hospital stay, complication rate, and success rate.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases, consulted experts, reviewed reference lists, used the 'related articles' PubMed feature, and reviewed scientific meeting abstracts for eligible articles published between 1993 and 26 June 2017. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess study quality. Subgroup analyses were performed regarding patient age, single or multisurgeon experience, presence of complex renal anatomy, study quality, Clavien-Dindo grades, and length of follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 4101 identified articles, 17 studies meeting our eligibility criteria were included for data extraction. All were observational studies, with 10 deemed to be of low quality. Meta-analysis showed that RAP resulted in a 27-min shorter operating time (weighted mean difference [WMD] -26.71 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] -44.42 to -9.00; P = 0.003) and a 1.2-day shorter length of hospital stay (WMD -1.21 days, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.57; P = 0.003). The quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated as very low. Significant heterogeneity was found when analysing operating time (P < 0.001) and length of hospital stay (P < 0.001), which could not be fully explained through subgroup analyses. We also identified other potentially significant sources of bias for which we could not adjust our analysis. RAP was also associated with a lower complication rate (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84; P = 0.005) and higher success rate (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.88; P = 0.008); however, whether statistical advantages for these two outcomes translated into clinically significant advantages was unclear. The quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated as low.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      For patients with PUJ obstruction, our meta-analyses show that RAP is advantageous concerning operating time, length of hospital stay, complication rate and success rate. Our conclusions, however, are weakened by poor quality of evidence and significant study heterogeneity. In addition, whether the statistical significance observed in the present meta-analysis translates into clinical significance is an important question. Further high-quality studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, are necessary to strengthen conclusions.",1
225,Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy: A Single-Center Analysis of Outcome With Experience and Systematic Review of the Literature,"Background:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to analyze the learning curve for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) in our series and review the literature on learning curves for LDP and robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Learning curve analysis was performed by split group and cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis of blood loss, operative time, and length of stay. The systematic review identified studies analyzing changes in outcome with experience.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 25 resections were performed. CUSUM analysis of operative time found learning curves of 10 cases for LDP and splenectomy and 11 for LDP with splenic preservation. CUSUM analysis of blood loss showed approximately 6 cases. In the literature, values of 10 cases of LDP and approximately 7 RDP were found.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Low numbers of LDP are required to reach proficiency in the hands of expert laparoscopic surgeons. Our results correspond with numbers quoted in the literature.",9
226,HoloMentor: A Novel Mixed Reality Surgical Anatomy Curriculum for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,"Objectives:
        
      
      The disruption to surgical training and medical education caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for realistic, reliable, and engaging educational opportunities available outside of the operating theatre and accessible for trainees of all levels. This article presents the design and development of a virtual reality curriculum which simulates the surgical mentorship experience outside of the operating theatre, with a focus on surgical anatomy and surgical decision-making.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This was a multi-institutional study between London's King's College and Imperial College. The index procedure selected for the module was robotic radical prostatectomy. For each stage of the surgical procedure, subject-matter experts (N = 3) at King's College London, identified (1) the critical surgical-decision making points, (2) critical anatomical landmarks, and (3) tips and techniques for overcoming intraoperative challenges. Content validity was determined by an independent panel of subject-matter experts (N = 8) at Imperial College, London, using Fleiss' kappa statistic. The experts' teaching points were combined with operative footage and illustrative animations, and projected onto a virtual reality headset. The module was piloted to surgical science students (N = 15). Quantitative analysis compared participants' confidence regarding their anatomical knowledge before and after taking the module. Qualitative data were gathered from students regarding their views on using the virtual reality model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Multi-rater agreement between experts was above the 70.0% threshold for all steps of the procedure. Seventy-three percentage of pilot study participants ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that they achieved a better understanding of surgical anatomy and the rationale behind each procedural step. This was reflected in an increase in the median knowledge score after trialing the curriculum (p < 0.001). 100% of subject-matter experts and 93.3% of participants ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that virtual mentorship would be useful for future surgical training.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrated that virtual surgical mentorship could be a feasible and cost-effective alternative to traditional training methods with the potential to improve technical skills, such as operative proficiency and nontechnical skills such as decision-making and situational judgement.",3
227,Robot assisted training for the upper limb after stroke (RATULS): a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Loss of arm function is a common problem after stroke. Robot-assisted training might improve arm function and activities of daily living. We compared the clinical effectiveness of robot-assisted training using the MIT-Manus robotic gym with an enhanced upper limb therapy (EULT) programme based on repetitive functional task practice and with usual care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      RATULS was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial done at four UK centres. Stroke patients aged at least 18 years with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation, between 1 week and 5 years after their first stroke, were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive robot-assisted training, EULT, or usual care. Robot-assisted training and EULT were provided for 45 min, three times per week for 12 weeks. Randomisation was internet-based using permuted block sequences. Treatment allocation was masked from outcome assessors but not from participants or therapists. The primary outcome was upper limb function success (defined using the Action Research Arm Test [ARAT]) at 3 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN69371850.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between April 14, 2014, and April 30, 2018, 770 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either robot-assisted training (n=257), EULT (n=259), or usual care (n=254). The primary outcome of ARAT success was achieved by 103 (44%) of 232 patients in the robot-assisted training group, 118 (50%) of 234 in the EULT group, and 85 (42%) of 203 in the usual care group. Compared with usual care, robot-assisted training (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·17 [98·3% CI 0·70-1·96]) and EULT (aOR 1·51 [0·90-2·51]) did not improve upper limb function; the effects of robot-assisted training did not differ from EULT (aOR 0·78 [0·48-1·27]). More participants in the robot-assisted training group (39 [15%] of 257) and EULT group (33 [13%] of 259) had serious adverse events than in the usual care group (20 [8%] of 254), but none were attributable to the intervention.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Robot-assisted training and EULT did not improve upper limb function after stroke compared with usual care for patients with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation. These results do not support the use of robot-assisted training as provided in this trial in routine clinical practice.

228,"Robotic Pyeloplasty in Children: A ""Barbed"" Shortcut","Introduction:
        
      
      Dismembered pyeloplasty remains the gold standard for the treatment of pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO). Robotic approach to this procedure has proven its efficacy and is gaining popularity. The introduction of barbed sutures such as ""V-Loc™"" (Covidien) has provided an addition to the sutures available for pyeloplasty. This work provides our experience with the V-Loc suture for closure of pelvis in children for robotic pyeloplasty (RP).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A review of 10 pediatric RP (da Vinci Robotic System) during which the V-Loc suture was used was performed. Comparison was made with 15 cases in which 5-0 Vicryl® suture was used as an alternative. Overall median age was 4 (range 9 months to 16 years), M:F = 14:9. All had confirmed PUJO on renal ultrasound and mercaptoacetyltriglycine (mertiatide) (MAG-3). RP was done in the standard Anderson-Hynes manner with the placement of a multilength JJ ureteral stent intraoperatively. Patients had removal of the JJ stent 6 weeks postoperatively followed by renal ultrasound 3-4 months later.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-five RPs have been performed between May 2013 and November 2015, of which 10 have had closure of the pelvis performed using the V-Loc suture and 15 with Vicryl. One patient (6.67%) in the Vicryl group underwent redo-pyeloplasty secondary to a stent-related complication. The entire V-Loc group made an eventful initial recovery; however, four (40%) developed worsening hydronephrosis and drainage on ultrasound and MAG-3 after stent removal, despite remaining completely asymptomatic. These four required either restenting and observation (n = 1) or redo-pyeloplasty (n = 3). Histology demonstrated a ""plaque-like"" inflammatory reaction at the pelvic suture line.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Closure of the pelvis using V-Loc suture material during RP can lead to a significant hydronephrosis requiring further procedures, including redo-pyeloplasty. These children can be asymptomatic and so extra vigilance on postoperative follow-up is essential.",1
229,"Positive Surgical Margins Rate of Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in a Contemporary, Unselected Cohort","Purpose:
        
      
      Our aim was to report the positive surgical margin (PSM) rate of Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RS-RARP) in an unselected, real-life cohort of patients treated at a fellowship-training urological department.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Demographic, clinical and pathological data of 529 consecutive patients who underwent RS-RARP between January 2017 and December 2020 were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively in a hospital-approved audit in a European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section (ERUS)-approved fellowship program. Overall PSM rates were reported for the entire cohort and for pT2 and pT3 patients separately. We defined clinically significant PSM as any length of >3 mm or multiple PSMs regardless of length.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median patient age was 64 years. More than 97% of the patients had intermediate or high-risk disease. The pathological stages were T2 (66.5%) and T3 (33.5%). Overall PSM was reported in 13.3% of pT2 patients and 28.9% of pT3 patients. Clinically significant PSM was reported in 43 patients (8.1%), and most of them (27 patients) had pT3 disease. Only 2.6% positive margins were reported at the apex and 0.7% on the anterior surface and bladder neck. Immediate continence (defined as no pads or 1 safety pad a day) rate was 65%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PSM rates of RS-RARP are acceptable and are higher in pT3 disease compared to pT2.",2
230,An intuitive surgical handle design for robotic neurosurgery,"Purpose:
        
      
      The expanded endoscopic endonasal approach, a representative example of keyhole brain surgery, allows access to the pituitary gland and surrounding areas through the nasal and sphenoid cavities. Manipulating rigid instruments through these constrained spaces makes this approach technically challenging, and thus, a handheld robotic instrument could expand the surgeon's capabilities. In this study, we present an intuitive handle prototype for such a robotic instrument.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We have designed and fabricated a surgical instrument handle prototype that maps the surgeon's wrist directly to the robot joints. To alleviate the surgeon's wrist of any excessive strain and fatigue, the tool is mounted on the surgeon's forearm, making it parallel with the instrument's shaft. To evaluate the handle's performance and limitations, we constructed a surgical task simulator and compared our novel handle with a standard neurosurgical tool, with the tasks being performed by a consultant neurosurgeon.
    


          Results:
        
      
      While using the proposed handle, the surgeon's average success rate was [Formula: see text], compared to [Formula: see text] when using a conventional tool. Additionally, the surgeon's body posture while using the suggested prototype was deemed acceptable by the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment ergonomic survey, while early results indicate the absence of a learning curve.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Based on these preliminary results, the proposed handle prototype could offer an improvement over current neurosurgical tools and procedural ergonomics. By redirecting forces applied during the procedure to the forearm of the surgeon, and allowing for intuitive surgeon wrist to robot-joints movement mapping without compromising the robotic end effector's expanded workspace, we believe that this handle could prove a substantial step toward improved neurosurgical instrumentation.",1
231,"Clinical Outcome of ""Asleep"" Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson Disease Using Robot-Assisted Delivery and Anatomic Targeting of the Subthalamic Nucleus: A Series of 152 Patients","Background:
        
      
      Recent advances in methods used for deep brain stimulation (DBS) include subthalamic nucleus electrode implantation in the ""asleep"" patient without the traditional use of microelectrode recordings or intraoperative test stimulation.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To examine the clinical outcome of patients who have undergone ""asleep"" DBS for the treatment of Parkinson disease using robot-assisted electrode delivery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a retrospective review of clinical outcomes of 152 consecutive patients. Their outcomes at 1 yr postimplantation are reported; these include Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment, Tinetti Mobility Test, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 quality of life assessment, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety. We also report on a new parietal trajectory for electrode implantation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 152 patients underwent assessment at 1 yr. UPDRS III improved from 39 to 20.5 (47%, P < .001). The total UPDRS score improved from 67.6 to 36.4 (46%, P < .001). UPDRS II scores improved from 18.9 to 10.5 (44%, P < .001) and UPDRS IV scores improved from 7.1 to 3.6 (49%, P < .001). There was a significant reduction in levodopa equivalent daily dose after surgery (mean: 35%, P < .001). PDQ-39 summary index improved by a mean of 7.1 points. There was no significant difference found in clinical outcomes between the frontal and parietal approaches.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      ""Asleep"" robot-assisted DBS of the subthalamic nucleus demonstrates comparable outcomes with traditional techniques in the treatment of Parkinson disease.",2
232,Outcomes of the RAFT trial: robotic surgery after focal therapy,"Objectives:
        
      
      To report toxicity of treatment observed in men participating in the Robotic surgery After Focal Therapy (RAFT) clinical trial.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Men were eligible for this prospective single group interventional study if they had histologically confirmed recurrent/residual prostate adenocarcinoma following primary FT. The short-form Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) measured prior to salvage robotic prostatectomy (S-RARP) and 3-monthly post-operatively together with Clavien-Dindo complications (I-IV). Secondary outcomes included biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCFS) following surgery and need for salvage treatment after surgery. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03011606.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-four men were recruited between February 2016 and September 2018. 1 patient withdrew from the trial after consenting and before S-RARP. 23 men completed 12-month post S-RARP follow-up. Median EPIC-26 urinary continence scores initially deteriorated after 3 months (82.4 vs 100) but there was no statistically significant difference from baseline at 12 months (100 vs 100, P = 0.31). Median lower urinary tract symptom scores improved after 12 months compared to baseline (93.8 vs 87.5, P = 0.01). At 12 months, 19/23 (83%) were pad-free and 22/23 (96%) required 0/1 pads. Median sexual function subscale scores deteriorated and remained low at 12 months (22.2 vs 58.3, P < 0.001). Utilising a minimally important difference of nine points, at 12 months after surgery 17/23 (74%) reported urinary continence to be 'better' or 'not different' to pre-operative baseline. The corresponding figure for sexual function (utilising a minimally important difference of 12 points) was 7/23 (30%). There was no statistically significant difference on median bowel/hormonal subscale scores. Only a single patient had a post-operative complication (Clavien-Dindo Grade I). BCFS at 12 months after surgery was 82.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.1-93.1%) while 4/23 (17%) received salvage radiation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The RAFT clinical trial suggests toxicity of surgery after FT is low, with good urinary function outcomes, albeit sexual function deteriorated overall. Oncological outcomes at 12 months appear acceptable.",2
233,Timing of neck dissection in association with transoral surgery: A systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to present our evaluation of the importance of timing (early vs synchronous vs delayed) in conjunction with transoral laser surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Articles addressing surgical management via transoral laser surgery for HNSCC were included for review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-six articles fulfilled our criteria. The overall 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was 75.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.3-83.9) and locoregional control was 87.3% (95% CI, 82.3-92.1), respectively. In the synchronous neck dissection group, the mean locoregional control was 89.9% (95% CI, 84.8-95.1) versus 84.5% (95% CI, 56.2-112.7) for the delayed neck dissection group. From studies in which complications were explicitly given, a bleeding rate of 5.3% (95% CI, 3.6-6.9) was established. There were 11.1% of patients who underwent a tracheostomy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is no evidence to indicate that timing of neck dissection after transoral laser surgery for HNSCC has any effect on overall survival (OS). © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2016 © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 1020-1032, 2017.",1
234,Artificial proprioceptive feedback for myoelectric control,"The typical control of myoelectric interfaces, whether in laboratory settings or real-life prosthetic applications, largely relies on visual feedback because proprioceptive signals from the controlling muscles are either not available or very noisy. We conducted a set of experiments to test whether artificial proprioceptive feedback, delivered noninvasively to another limb, can improve control of a two-dimensional myoelectrically-controlled computer interface. In these experiments, participants were required to reach a target with a visual cursor that was controlled by electromyogram signals recorded from muscles of the left hand, while they were provided with an additional proprioceptive feedback on their right arm by moving it with a robotic manipulandum. Provision of additional artificial proprioceptive feedback improved the angular accuracy of their movements when compared to using visual feedback alone but did not increase the overall accuracy quantified with the average distance between the cursor and the target. The advantages conferred by proprioception were present only when the proprioceptive feedback had similar orientation to the visual feedback in the task space and not when it was mirrored, demonstrating the importance of congruency in feedback modalities for multi-sensory integration. Our results reveal the ability of the human motor system to learn new inter-limb sensory-motor associations; the motor system can utilize task-related sensory feedback, even when it is available on a limb distinct from the one being actuated. In addition, the proposed task structure provides a flexible test paradigm by which the effectiveness of various sensory feedback and multi-sensory integration for myoelectric prosthesis control can be evaluated.",4
235,Standardized technique for single-docking robotic rectal surgery,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this technical note is to describe our standardized technique for rectal surgery using a single-docking totally robotic approach.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The data related to patients who underwent single-docking robotic rectal surgery were analysed for the feasibility of this approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This technique was used in 124 consecutive patients who underwent rectal resection since July 2013. Male to female ratio of patients was 2:1 while median age was 67 years (range 24-92). The median operating time was 240 min (range 105-456), whilst blood loss was 10 ml (range 0-200). There was no evidence of intra-operative complications or conversions to either a laparoscopic or an open procedure. The median length of stay was 7 days (range 3-48).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A single-docking technique for robotic rectal surgery is safe and feasible. It can be considered as standard approach for pelvic robotic surgery.",9
236,Do People Trust in Robot-Assisted Surgery? Evidence from Europe,"(1) Background: The goal of the paper was to establish the factors that influence how people feel about having a medical operation performed on them by a robot. (2) Methods: Data were obtained from a 2017 Flash Eurobarometer (number 460) of the European Commission with 27,901 citizens aged 15 years and over in the 28 countries of the European Union. Logistic regression (odds ratios, OR) to model the predictors of trust in robot-assisted surgery was calculated through motivational factors, using experience and sociodemographic independent variables. (3) Results: The results obtained indicate that, as the experience of using robots increases, the predictive coefficients related to information, attitude, and perception of robots become more negative. Furthermore, sociodemographic variables played an important predictive role. The effect of experience on trust in robots for surgical interventions was greater among men, people between 40 and 54 years old, and those with higher educational levels. (4) Conclusions: The results show that trust in robots goes beyond rational decision-making, since the final decision about whether it should be a robot that performs a complex procedure like a surgical intervention depends almost exclusively on the patient's wishes.",3
237,Trust Dynamics and Verbal Assurances in Human Robot Physical Collaboration,"Trust is the foundation of successful human collaboration. This has also been found to be true for human-robot collaboration, where trust has also influence on over- and under-reliance issues. Correspondingly, the study of trust in robots is usually concerned with the detection of the current level of the human collaborator trust, aiming at keeping it within certain limits to avoid undesired consequences, which is known as trust calibration. However, while there is intensive research on human-robot trust, there is a lack of knowledge about the factors that affect it in synchronous and co-located teamwork. Particularly, there is hardly any knowledge about how these factors impact the dynamics of trust during the collaboration. These factors along with trust evolvement characteristics are prerequisites for a computational model that allows robots to adapt their behavior dynamically based on the current human trust level, which in turn is needed to enable a dynamic and spontaneous cooperation. To address this, we conducted a two-phase lab experiment in a mixed-reality environment, in which thirty-two participants collaborated with a virtual CoBot on disassembling traction batteries in a recycling context. In the first phase, we explored the (dynamics of) relevant trust factors during physical human-robot collaboration. In the second phase, we investigated the impact of robot's reliability and feedback on human trust in robots. Results manifest stronger trust dynamics while dissipating than while accumulating and highlight different relevant factors as more interactions occur. Besides, the factors that show relevance as trust accumulates differ from those appear as trust dissipates. We detected four factors while trust accumulates (perceived reliability, perceived dependability, perceived predictability, and faith) which do not appear while it dissipates. This points to an interesting conclusion that depending on the stage of the collaboration and the direction of trust evolvement, different factors might shape trust. Further, the robot's feedback accuracy has a conditional effect on trust depending on the robot's reliability level. It preserves human trust when a failure is expected but does not affect it when the robot works reliably. This provides a hint to designers on when assurances are necessary and when they are redundant.",4
238,"Non-invasive sensor methods used in monitoring newborn babies after birth, a clinical perspective","Background:
        
      
      Reducing the global new-born mortality is a paramount challenge for humanity. There are approximately 786,323 live births in the UK each year according to the office for National Statistics; around 10% of these newborn infants require assistance during this transition after birth. Each year around, globally around 2.5 million newborns die within their first month. The main causes are complications due to prematurity and during delivery. To act in a timely manner and prevent further damage, health professionals should rely on accurate monitoring of the main vital signs heart rate and respiratory rate.
    


          Aims:
        
      
      To present a clinical perspective on innovative, non-invasive methods to monitor heart rate and respiratory rate in babies highlighting their advantages and limitations in comparison with well-established methods.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the data collected in our recently published systematic review we highlight the barriers and facilitators for the novel sensor devices in obtaining reliable heart rate measurements. Details about difficulties related to the application of sensors and interfaces, time to display, and user feedback are explored. We also provide a unique overview of using a non-invasive respiratory rate monitoring method by extracting RR from the pulse oximetry trace of newborn babies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Novel sensors to monitor heart rate offer the advantages of minimally obtrusive technologies but have limitations due to movement artefact, bad sensor coupling, intermittent measurement, and poor-quality recordings compared to gold standard well established methods. Respiratory rate can be derived accurately from pleth recordings in infants.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Some limitations have been identified in current methods to monitor heart rate and respiratory rate in newborn babies. Novel minimally invasive sensors have advantages that may help clinical practice. Further research studies are needed to assess whether they are sufficiently accurate, practical, and reliable to be suitable for clinical use.",0
239,The Developing Human Connectome Project Neonatal Data Release,"The Developing Human Connectome Project has created a large open science resource which provides researchers with data for investigating typical and atypical brain development across the perinatal period. It has collected 1228 multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain datasets from 1173 fetal and/or neonatal participants, together with collateral demographic, clinical, family, neurocognitive and genomic data from 1173 participants, together with collateral demographic, clinical, family, neurocognitive and genomic data. All subjects were studied in utero and/or soon after birth on a single MRI scanner using specially developed scanning sequences which included novel motion-tolerant imaging methods. Imaging data are complemented by rich demographic, clinical, neurodevelopmental, and genomic information. The project is now releasing a large set of neonatal data; fetal data will be described and released separately. This release includes scans from 783 infants of whom: 583 were healthy infants born at term; as well as preterm infants; and infants at high risk of atypical neurocognitive development. Many infants were imaged more than once to provide longitudinal data, and the total number of datasets being released is 887. We now describe the dHCP image acquisition and processing protocols, summarize the available imaging and collateral data, and provide information on how the data can be accessed.",7
240,Prospective Longitudinal Health-related Quality of Life Analysis of the Finnish Arm of the PRIAS Active Surveillance Cohort: 11 Years of Follow-up,"Background:
        
      
      Living with an untreated cancer may alter quality of life (QoL) in the long term.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To prospectively study long-term changes in general, mental, and physical QoL in a contemporary active surveillance (AS) patient cohort with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      The study population consisted of patients enrolled in the PRIAS trial in Helsinki University Hospital (n = 348). The RAND-36 questionnaire was used to assess general QoL at the start of AS and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 years during follow-up. Patients who had undergone robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP; n = 88) also received the questionnaire after treatment.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Changes over time were analysed using multilevel mixed-effects regression models, and reported as the mean and95% confidence interval. A rule of 0.5 × standard deviation was used to estimate changes of clinical importance.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Median follow-up until the end of AS or last follow-up was 7.2 (range 0.3-12.7) yr. A decrease was observed in six of eight QoL subdomains at 7 yr. However, all scores were above age-stratified reference values. There was no difference between the group who continued AS throughout the study period and the group who discontinued AS and underwent RALP. More than half of the study cohort discontinued AS (n = 198; 57%), 135 men (68%) because of events specified in the protocol and only seven (3.5%) because of anxiety. Metastatic disease developed in six patients (1.7%), and two cases (0.6%) of PCa-related death were recorded among 348 patients in more than 12 yr of overall follow-up. The lack of a randomised control population is a limitation of the study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Contemporary protocolised AS does not impair general QoL. Men undergoing a treatment change (RALP) did not experience a decrease in QoL before or after their treatment change.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Active surveillance is a safe treatment option for men with low-risk prostate cancer. We show that this follow-up strategy does not cause a decline in patients' general quality of life.",2
241,Tadalafil 5 mg Alone or in Combination with Tamsulosin 0.4 mg for the Management of Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Erectile Dysfunction: Results of a Prospective Observational Trial,"Tadalafil 5 mg represents the standard for men with Erectile dysfunction (ED) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). We carried out an observational trial aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of Tadalafil compared with Tadalafil plus Tamsulosin. Seventy-five patients complaining of ED and LUTS were treated for 12-weeks with Tadalafil plus placebo (TAD+PLA-group) or with combination therapy tadalafil plus tamsulosin (TAD+TAM-group). Efficacy variables were: International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and safety assessments. Data were evaluated using paired samples T-test (baseline vs. 12-weeks) and analysis of variance (Δgroup-TAD+PLA vs. Δgroup-TAD+TAM). At baseline, both groups presented similar characteristics and symptoms scores (all: p > 0.05). From baseline to 12-weeks, all the subjects showed a significant improvement of IIEF, total-IPSS, storage-IPSS, Qmax (all: p < 0.001). Conversely, a significant improvement of voiding-IPSS was observed in TAD+TAM-group (-3.5 points, p < 0.001). Indeed, TAD+PLA-group showed a not significant improvement of voiding-IPSS (-2.0 points, p = 0.074). When we compared between-groups differences at 12-weeks, IIEF (p = 0.255), total-IPSS (p = 0.084) and storage-IPSS (p = 0.08) did not show any statistically significant differences, whereas, voiding-IPSS and Qmax were significantly better in TAD+TAM-group (p = 0.006 and p = 0.027, respectively). No severe treatment adverse events (TAEs) were reported in both groups. Tadalafil achieved the same improvements of IIEF, total-IPSS, storage-IPSS when compared to combination therapy. Instead, Qmax and voiding-IPSS were better managed with combination therapy, without change of TAEs.",2
242,Cardiopulmonary reserve as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing correlates with length of stay and predicts complications after radical cystectomy,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate whether poor preoperative cardiopulmonary reserve and comorbid state dictate high-risk status and can predict complications in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      In all, 105 consecutive patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC; stage T1-T3) undergoing robot-assisted (38 patients) or open (67) RC in a single UK centre underwent preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Prospective primary outcome variables were all-cause complications and postoperative length of stay (LOS). Binary logistic regression analysis identified potential predictive factor(s) and the predictive accuracy of CPET for all-cause complications was examined using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Correlations analysis employed Spearman's rank correlation and group comparison, the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test. Any relationships were confirmed using the Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio estimate, Kaplan-Meier analysis and the chi-squared test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The anaerobic threshold (AT) was negatively (r = -206, P = 0.035), and the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO₂) positively (r = 0.324, P = 0.001) correlated with complications and LOS. Logistic regression analysis identified low AT (<11 mL/kg/min), high VE/VC0₂ (≥33) and hypertension as significant factors, such that, in their presence patients were 5.55-times more likely to have complications at 90 days postoperatively [P = 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-13.9]. ROC analysis showed a high significance (area under the curve 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.87; P < 0.001). In addition, based on CPET criteria >50% of patients presenting for RC had significant heart failure, whereas preoperatively only very few (2%) had this diagnosis. Analysis using the Mann-Whitney test showed that a VE/VCO₂ ≥33 was the most significant determinant of LOS (P = 0.004). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in this group had an additional median LOS of 4 days (P = 0.008). Finally, patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 3 (ASA 3) and those on long-term β-blocker therapy were found to be at particular risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and death after RC with odds ratios of 4.0 (95% CI 1.05-15.2; P = 0.042) and 6.3 (95% CI 1.60-24.8; P = 0.008).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve and hypertension are at higher risk of postoperative complications and have increased LOS after RC. Heart failure is known to be a significant determinant of perioperative death and is significantly under diagnosed in this patient group.",5
243,"Real-world experience with cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a final, pooled analysis of the compassionate use programme and early access programme","Background:
        
      
      Cabazitaxel is a second-generation taxane approved for use in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with docetaxel. Early access programmes were established to allow eligible patients with mCRPC access to cabazitaxel before regulatory approval.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The primary objective was to allow access to cabazitaxel before commercial availability for patients with mCRPC whose disease had progressed during or after chemotherapy with docetaxel; the secondary objective was overall safety. Patients received cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, with daily oral 10 mg prednisone/prednisolone. G-CSF was administered per ASCO guidelines.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 1432 patients received cabazitaxel across 41 countries between 2010 and 2014 (median 6.0 treatment cycles [range 1-49]). The most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) possibly related to treatment were diarrhoea (33.3%), fatigue (25.4%) and anaemia (23.7%); the most frequently occurring possibly related Grade 3/4 TEAEs were neutropenia (18.7%) and febrile neutropenia (6.9%). G-CSF was administered in ≥ 1 cycle in 64% of patients (10.1% therapeutic use; 57.8% prophylactic use; 9.7% both uses).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The safety profile of cabazitaxel in this pooled analysis of two cabazitaxel early access programmes was manageable and consistent with previous Phase III trials (TROPIC, PROSELICA).",2
244,Child health technology: shaping the future of paediatrics and child health and improving NHS productivity,"In the last decade, technology has revolutionised the way we deliver healthcare. Smartphones, tablets, personal computers and bespoke devices have provided patients with the means to access health information, manage their healthcare and communicate with health professionals remotely. Advances in technology have the potential to change how acute and long-term conditions are diagnosed and managed and how illness is prevented using technological advances in artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, robotics, 3D printing, new materials, biosensor technologies and data analytics. In the future, predictive analytics will help with earlier disease diagnosis in at-risk populations.Historically, development of child health innovation and technology has taken place in a relatively emergent manner with little formal coordination. The aim is to move away from the traditional approach of repurposing adult technologies to provide a large-scale and coordinated approach for the development of bespoke health technology for children that is anatomically, physiologically and developmentally appropriate, versatile and that has been designed with children and young people. The challenge for the National Health Service alongside healthcare systems across the world is to deliver increasingly complex healthcare at lower cost and with better quality of life and greater efficiency.",0
245,Information Fusion in Autonomous Vehicle Using Artificial Neural Group Key Synchronization,"Information fusion in automated vehicle for various datatypes emanating from many resources is the foundation for making choices in intelligent transportation autonomous cars. To facilitate data sharing, a variety of communication methods have been integrated to build a diverse V2X infrastructure. However, information fusion security frameworks are currently intended for specific application instances, that are insufficient to fulfill the overall requirements of Mutual Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS). In this work, a data fusion security infrastructure has been developed with varying degrees of trust. Furthermore, in the V2X heterogeneous networks, this paper offers an efficient and effective information fusion security mechanism for multiple sources and multiple type data sharing. An area-based PKI architecture with speed provided by a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is given in especially for artificial neural synchronization-based quick group key exchange. A parametric test is performed to ensure that the proposed data fusion trust solution meets the stringent delay requirements of V2X systems. The efficiency of the suggested method is tested, and the results show that it surpasses similar strategies already in use.",1
246,"Intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy in sequential treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis: To be, or not to be, that is the question A cohort study","Background:
        
      
      Choledocholithiasis occurs in 10-15% of patients with cholecystolithiasis. Despite the existence of many therapeutic options for the treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis, a sequential treatment in which pre-operative ERCP is combined with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), is the most commonly accepted strategy. However, use of IOC in the ""splitting treatment"" of cholecystocholedocholithiasis is controversial. The aim of the present study is to investigate the utility of IOC in detecting residual stones in patients undergoing LC in the sequential treatment of common biliary duct or gallbladder stones.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were recruited retrospectively among those who underwent IOC during LC, performed as second stage in the sequential treatment for cholecystocholedocholithiasis between 2010 and 2016. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from CPT codes at Ospedale Monaldi A.O.R.N dei Colli Naples, Italy. Data obtained from all pre-operative ERCP analyses were recorded, including cholangiogram findings and performance of sphincterotomy. Statistical analysis was carried out using the IBM SPSS Statistic 19.0 software package.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between January 2010 and December 2016 575 patients (343 males, 242 females) underwent IOC during LC for symptomatic cholecystitis due to cholelithiasis. Among patients accrued for the study, 143 underwent preoperative ERCP for suspicion of common biliary duct stones. At the time of pre-operative ERCP, 123 were found to have common biliary duct stones while 20 (15%) presented negative ERCP. Complete removal of stones was accomplished in 119 patients. Among these patients, 13 had residual common biliary duct stones diagnosed by IOC (11%). Two patients underwent laparoscopic bile duct revision and, last, two patients were referred for ERCP at a later point. It is of note that all patients who presented residual stones by IOC had undergone pre-operative sphincterotomy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study demonstrates that IOC is particularly effective in detecting residual stones in patients undergoing LC in sequential treatment of common biliary duct and/or gallbladder stones, and may be used on a routine basis in the sequential treatment of cholecystocholedocholithiasis.",0
247,Targeted tDCS selectively improves motor adaptation with the proximal and distal upper limb,"Background:
        
      
      The cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1) are crucial to coordinated and accurate movements of the upper limbs. There is also appreciable evidence that these two structures exert somewhat divergent influences upon proximal versus distal upper limb control. Here, we aimed to differentially regulate the contribution of the cerebellum and M1 to proximal and distal effectors during motor adaptation, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). For this, we employed tasks that promote similar motor demands, but isolate whole arm from hand/finger movements, in order to functionally segregate the hierarchy of upper limb control.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Both young and older adults took part in a visuomotor rotation task; where they adapted to a 60° visuomotor rotation using either a hand-held joystick (requiring finger/hand movements) or a 2D robotic manipulandum (requiring whole-arm reaching movements), while M1, cerebellar or sham tDCS was applied.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that cerebellar stimulation improved adaptation performance when arm movements were required to complete the task, while in contrast stimulation of M1 enhanced adaptation during hand and finger movements only. This double-dissociation was replicated in an independent group of older adults, demonstrating that the behaviour remains intact in ageing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results suggest that stimulation of distinct motor areas can selectively improve motor adaptation in the proximal and distal upper limb. This also highlights new ways in which tDCS might be best applied to achieve reliable rehabilitation of upper limb motor deficits.",6
248,"PEOPLE: PatiEnt prOstate samPLes for rEsearch, a tissue collection pathway utilizing magnetic resonance imaging data to target tumor and benign tissue in fresh radical prostatectomy specimens","Background:
        
      
      Over 1 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year worldwide, with a wide range of research programs requiring access to patient tissue samples for development of improved diagnoses and treatments. A random sampling of prostate tissue is sufficient for certain research studies; however, there is growing research need to target areas of the aggressive tumor as fresh tissue. Here we set out to develop a new pathway ""PEOPLE: PatiEnt prOstate samPLes for rEsearch"" to collect high-quality fresh tissue for research use, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to target areas of tumor and benign tissue.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prostate tissue was sampled following robotic radical prostatectomy, using MRI data to target areas of benign and tumor tissue. Initially, 25 cases were sampled using MRI information from clinical notes. A further 59 cases were sampled using an optimized method that included specific MRI measurements of tumor location along with additional exclusion criteria. All cases were reviewed in batches with detailed clinical and histopathological data recorded. For one subset of samples, DNA was extracted and underwent quality control. Ex vivo culture was carried out using the gelatin sponge method for an additional subset.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Tumor was successfully fully or partially targeted in 64% of the initial cohort and 70% of the optimized cohort. DNA of high quality and concentration was isolated from 39 tumor samples, and ex vivo culture was successfully carried out in three cases with tissue morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis remaining comparable before and after 72 hours culture.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Here we report initial data from the PEOPLE pathway; using a method for targeting areas of tumor within prostate samples using MRI. This method operates alongside the standard clinical pathway and minimizes additional input from surgical, radiological, and pathological teams, while preserving surgical margins and diagnostic tissue.",0
249,Through the HoloLens™ looking glass: augmented reality for extremity reconstruction surgery using 3D vascular models with perforating vessels,"Precision and planning are key to reconstructive surgery. Augmented reality (AR) can bring the information within preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging to life, allowing the surgeon to 'see through' the patient's skin and appreciate the underlying anatomy without making a single incision. This work has demonstrated that AR can assist the accurate identification, dissection and execution of vascular pedunculated flaps during reconstructive surgery. Separate volumes of osseous, vascular, skin, soft tissue structures and relevant vascular perforators were delineated from preoperative CTA scans to generate three-dimensional images using two complementary segmentation software packages. These were converted to polygonal models and rendered by means of a custom application within the HoloLens™ stereo head-mounted display. Intraoperatively, the models were registered manually to their respective subjects by the operating surgeon using a combination of tracked hand gestures and voice commands; AR was used to aid navigation and accurate dissection. Identification of the subsurface location of vascular perforators through AR overlay was compared to the positions obtained by audible Doppler ultrasound. Through a preliminary HoloLens-assisted case series, the operating surgeon was able to demonstrate precise and efficient localisation of perforating vessels.",0
250,Excitatory versus inhibitory feedback in Bayesian formulations of scene construction,"The selective attention for identification model (SAIM) is an established model of selective visual attention. SAIM implements translation-invariant object recognition, in scenes with multiple objects, using the parallel distributed processing (PDP) paradigm. Here, we show that SAIM can be formulated as Bayesian inference. Crucially, SAIM uses excitatory feedback to combine top-down information (i.e. object knowledge) with bottom-up sensory information. By contrast, predictive coding implementations of Bayesian inference use inhibitory feedback. By formulating SAIM as a predictive coding scheme, we created a new version of SAIM that uses inhibitory feedback. Simulation studies showed that both types of architectures can reproduce the response time costs induced by multiple objects-as found in visual search experiments. However, due to the different nature of the feedback, the two SAIM schemes make distinct predictions about the motifs of microcircuits mediating the effects of top-down afferents. We discuss empirical (neuroimaging) methods to test the predictions of the two inference architectures.",4
251,Ballistocardiogram artifact correction taking into account physiological signal preservation in simultaneous EEG-fMRI,"The ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact is currently one of the most challenging in the EEG acquired concurrently with fMRI, with correction invariably yielding residual artifacts and/or deterioration of the physiological signals of interest. In this paper, we propose a family of methods whereby the EEG is decomposed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a novel approach for the selection of BCG-related independent components (ICs) is used (PROJection onto Independent Components, PROJIC). Three ICA-based strategies for BCG artifact correction are then explored: 1) BCG-related ICs are removed from the back-reconstruction of the EEG (PROJIC); and 2-3) BCG-related ICs are corrected for the artifact occurrences using an Optimal Basis Set (OBS) or Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS) framework, before back-projecting all ICs onto EEG space (PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS, respectively). A novel evaluation pipeline is also proposed to assess the methods performance, which takes into account not only artifact but also physiological signal removal, allowing for a flexible weighting of the importance given to physiological signal preservation. This evaluation is used for the group-level parameter optimization of each algorithm on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquired using two different setups at 3T and 7T. Comparison with state-of-the-art BCG correction methods showed that PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS outperformed the others when priority was given to artifact removal or physiological signal preservation, respectively, while both PROJIC-AAS and AAS were in general the best choices for intermediate trade-offs. The impact of the BCG correction on the quality of event-related potentials (ERPs) of interest was assessed in terms of the relative reduction of the standard error (SE) across trials: 26/66%, 32/62% and 18/61% were achieved by, respectively, PROJIC, PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS, for data collected at 3T/7T. Although more significant improvements were achieved at 7T, the results were qualitatively comparable for both setups, which indicate the wide applicability of the proposed methodologies and recommendations.",0
252,Surgical therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy/bladder outflow obstruction,"Monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with endoscopic electrocautery remains the gold standard surgical technique for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) by which all new procedures are compared. We reviewed the current literature, and international urological guidelines and consensus opinion on various surgical options for BPH and present a brief overview of alternative techniques including bipolar TURP, transurethral incision of the prostate, transurethral vaporization of the prostate, laser prostatectomy (with holmium, thulium and potassium titanyl phosphate greenlight lasers) and open prostatectomy (with mention of new techniques including laparoscopic and robotic prostatectomy). Emerging, experimental and less established techniques are also described including endoscopic heat generation (transurethral microwave thermotherapy, radiofrequency transurethral needle ablation of the prostate, high intensity focused ultrasound, hot water induced thermotherapy, pulsed electromagnetic radiofrequency), injection therapy (transurethral ethanol ablation and botulinum toxin) and mechanical devices (intraprostatic stents and urethral lift devices). Despite a plethora of surgical options, none have realistically improved outcomes in the long-term compared with TURP. Improvements have been made on improving surgical morbidity and time in hospital. Questions remain in this area, including what specific elements of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) result in damage to the urinary tract, how does BPH contribute to BOO and how much prostate volume reduction is necessary to relieve BOO or lower urinary tract symptoms. Given these unanswered questions and the multitude of procedures available, it is clear that appropriate counselling is necessary in all men who undergo BPH surgery.",1
253,Patterns of practice for adaptive and real-time radiation therapy (POP-ART RT) part I: Intra-fraction breathing motion management,"Purpose:
        
      
      The POP-ART RT study aims to determine to what extent and how intra-fractional real-time respiratory motion management (RRMM) and plan adaptation for inter-fractional anatomical changes (ART), are used in clinical practice and to understand barriers to implementation. Here we report on part I: RRMM.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A questionnaire was distributed worldwide to assess current clinical practice, wishes for expansion or new implementation and barriers to implementation. RRMM was defined as inspiration/expiration gating in free-breathing or breath-hold, or tracking where the target and the beam are continuously realigned.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The questionnaire was completed by 200 centres from 41 countries. RRMM was used by 68% of respondents ('users') for a median (range) of 2 (1-6) tumour sites. Eighty-one percent of users applied inspiration breath-hold in at least one tumour site (breast: 96%). External marker was used to guide RRMM by 61% of users. KV/MV imaging was frequently used for liver and pancreas (with fiducials) and for lung (with or without fiducials). Tracking was mainly performed on robotic linacs with hybrid internal-external monitoring. For breast and lung, approximately 75% of respondents used or wished to implement RRMM, which was lower for liver (44%) and pancreas (27%). Seventy-one percent of respondents wished to implement RRMM for a new tumour site. Main barriers were human/financial resources and capacity on the machine.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Sixty-eight percent of respondents used RRMM and 71% wished to implement RRMM for a new tumour site. The main barriers to implementation were human/financial resources and capacity on treatment machines.",0
254,Consequences of converting graded to action potentials upon neural information coding and energy efficiency,"Information is encoded in neural circuits using both graded and action potentials, converting between them within single neurons and successive processing layers. This conversion is accompanied by information loss and a drop in energy efficiency. We investigate the biophysical causes of this loss of information and efficiency by comparing spiking neuron models, containing stochastic voltage-gated Na(+) and K(+) channels, with generator potential and graded potential models lacking voltage-gated Na(+) channels. We identify three causes of information loss in the generator potential that are the by-product of action potential generation: (1) the voltage-gated Na(+) channels necessary for action potential generation increase intrinsic noise and (2) introduce non-linearities, and (3) the finite duration of the action potential creates a 'footprint' in the generator potential that obscures incoming signals. These three processes reduce information rates by ∼50% in generator potentials, to ∼3 times that of spike trains. Both generator potentials and graded potentials consume almost an order of magnitude less energy per second than spike trains. Because of the lower information rates of generator potentials they are substantially less energy efficient than graded potentials. However, both are an order of magnitude more efficient than spike trains due to the higher energy costs and low information content of spikes, emphasizing that there is a two-fold cost of converting analogue to digital; information loss and cost inflation.",4
255,Systematic review: Radiological and histological evidence of cochlear implant insertion trauma in adult patients,"Introduction:
        
      
      Cochlear implantation (CI) has developed from its origins in the 1980s. Initially, CI was for profound bilateral hearing impairment. However, candidacy for CI have become more widespread in recent years with unilateral implantation and an emphasis on hearing preservation. Evidence supports full electrode insertion in an atraumatic fashion into the scala tympani (ST) provides optimal hearing outcomes. The main aim of this systematic review was to elucidate the degree of trauma associated with CI insertion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was undertaken using PubMed Medline. A grading system described by Eshraghi was used to classify cochlear trauma. Both radiological and histological studies were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty one papers were identified which were relevant to our search. In total, 653 implants were inserted and 115 (17.6%) showed evidence of trauma. The cochleas with trauma had basilar membrane elevation in 5.2%, ruptured in 5.2%, the electrode passed from the ST to the SV in 84.4% and there was grade 4 trauma in 5.2%. The studies used a variety of histological and radiological methods to assess for evidence of trauma in both cadaveric temporal bones and live recipients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Minimizing cochlear trauma during implant insertion is important to preserve residual hearing and optimize audiological performance. An overall 17.6% trauma rate suggests that CI insertion could be improved with more accurate and consistent electrode insertion such as in the form of robotic guidance. The correlation of cochlea trauma with post-operative hearing has yet to be determined.",1
256,Defining Factors Associated with High-quality Surgery Following Radical Cystectomy: Analysis of the British Association of Urological Surgeons Cystectomy Audit,"Background:
        
      
      Radical cystectomy (RC) is associated with high morbidity.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate healthcare and surgical factors associated with high-quality RC surgery.
    


          Design setting and participants:
        
      
      Patients within the prospective British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) registry between 2014 and 2017 were included in this study.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      High-quality surgery was defined using pathological (absence of positive surgical margins and a minimum of a level I lymph node dissection template with a minimum yield of ten or more lymph nodes), recovery (length of stay ≤10 d), and technical (intraoperative blood loss <500 ml for open and <300 ml for minimally invasive RC) variables. A multilevel hierarchical mixed-effect logistic regression model was utilised to determine the factors associated with the receipt of high-quality surgery and index admission mortality.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      A total of 4654 patients with a median age of 70.0 yr underwent RC by 152 surgeons at 78 UK hospitals. The median surgeon and hospital operating volumes were 23.0 and 47.0 cases, respectively. A total of 914 patients (19.6%) received high-quality surgery. The minimum annual surgeon volume and hospital volume of ≥20 RCs/surgeon/yr and ≥68 RCs/hospital/yr, respectively, were the thresholds determined to achieve better rates of high-quality RC. The mixed-effect logistic regression model found that recent surgery (odds ratio [OR]: 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.34, p < 0.001), laparoscopic/robotic RC (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.45-2.37, p < 0.001), and higher annual surgeon operating volume (23.1-33.0 cases [OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.16-2.05, p = 0.003]; ≥33.1 cases [OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.18-2.29, p = 0.003]) were independently associated with high-quality surgery. High-quality surgery was an independent predictor of lower index admission mortality (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16-0.87, p = 0.021).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We report that annual surgeon operating volume and use of minimally invasive RC were predictors of high-quality surgery. Patients receiving high-quality surgery were independently associated with lower index admission mortality. Our results support the role of centralisation of complex oncology and implementation of a quality assurance programme to improve the delivery of care.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this registry study of patients treated with surgical excision of the urinary bladder for bladder cancer, we report that patients treated by a surgeon with a higher annual operative volume and a minimally invasive approach were associated with the receipt of high-quality surgery. Patients treated with high-quality surgery were more likely to be discharged alive following surgery.",5
257,The Endourological Society Inaugural Census Report,"The Endourological Society, the premier urologic society encompassing endourology, robotics, and focal surgery, is composed of a diverse group of >1300 urologists. However, limited information has been collected about society members. Recognizing this need, a survey was initiated to capture data regarding current member practices, as well as help the Society shape the future direction of the organization. Presented herein is the inaugural Endourological Society census report as the beginning of a continued effort for global improvement in the field of endourology. Using a REDCap® database, an email survey was circulated to the membership of the Endourological Society from May through June 2021. Twenty questions were posed, categorizing member data in terms of epidemiology/demographics, practice patterns, member opinions, and future educational preferences. Responses were received from 534 members, representing 40.3% of membership. Data demonstrated that the average age, gender, race, and ethnicity of the typical Society member respondent is a 48-year-old Caucasian male working in the United States, with a mean of 25 years in practice. Retrograde endoscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy were identified as the most common practice skills, and 50% of members are involved in robotics. Importantly, the census confirmed that the World Congress of Endourology and Technology remains popular with Society members as a means of educational advancement. To sustain and advance the Society, information is required to understand the career interests and future educational desires of its members. This inaugural census provides crucial data regarding its membership and how the Society can achieve continued success and adjust its focus. Future census efforts will expand on the initial findings and stratify the data to elucidate changes in the needs of the Society as a whole. Circulating an annual census will allow for continued improvements in the field of endourology and, ultimately, better care for urologic patients.",0
258,Photoswitchable gating of non-equilibrium enzymatic feedback in chemically communicating polymersome nanoreactors,"The circadian rhythm generates out-of-equilibrium metabolite oscillations that are controlled by feedback loops under light/dark cycles. Here we describe a non-equilibrium nanosystem comprising a binary population of enzyme-containing polymersomes capable of light-gated chemical communication, controllable feedback and coupling to macroscopic oscillations. The populations consist of esterase-containing polymersomes functionalized with photo-responsive donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASA) and light-insensitive semipermeable urease-loaded polymersomes. The DASA-polymersome membrane becomes permeable under green light, switching on esterase activity and decreasing the pH, which in turn initiates the production of alkali in the urease-containing population. A pH-sensitive pigment that absorbs green light when protonated provides a negative feedback loop for deactivating the DASA-polymersomes. Simultaneously, increased alkali production deprotonates the pigment, reactivating esterase activity by opening the membrane gate. We utilize light-mediated fluctuations of pH to perform non-equilibrium communication between the nanoreactors and use the feedback loops to induce work as chemomechanical swelling/deswelling oscillations in a crosslinked hydrogel. We envision possible applications in artificial organelles, protocells and soft robotics.",4
259,Two-Year Outcomes After Aquablation Compared to TURP: Efficacy and Ejaculatory Improvements Sustained,"Introduction:
        
      
      To compare 2-year safety and efficacy outcomes after Aquablation or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      One hundred eighty-one patients with BPH were assigned at random (2:1 ratio) to either Aquablation or TURP. Patients and follow-up assessors were blinded to treatment. Assessments included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Male Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ), International Index of Erectile Function and uroflow. The focus of analysis was 2-year outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 2 years, IPSS scores improved by 14.7 points in the Aquablation group and 14.9 points in TURP (p = .8304, 95% CI for difference - 2.1 to 2.6 points). Two-year improvements in maximum flow rate (Qmax) were large in both groups at 11.2 and 8.6 cc/s for Aquablation and TURP, respectively (p = 0.1880, 95% CI for difference - 1.3 to 6.4). Sexual function as assessed by MSHQ was stable in the Aquablation group and decreased slightly in the TURP group. At 2 years, PSA was reduced significantly in both groups by 0.7 and 1.2 points, respectively; the reduction was similar across groups (p = 0.1816). Surgical retreatment rates after 12 months for Aquablation were 1.7% and 0% for TURP. Over 2 years, surgical BPH retreatment rates were 4.3% and 1.5% (p = 0.4219), respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Two-year efficacy outcomes after TURP and Aquablation were similar, and the rate of surgical retreatment was low and similar to TURP.

260,Open Partial Nephrectomy with Zero Ischaemia Using a Supra 12th Rib Miniflank Incision: A Minimally Invasive Open Approach for Small Renal Masses,"Introduction:
        
      
      To assess a minimally invasive open technique for partial nephrectomy with zero ischaemia time.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A review was performed in a prospectively maintained database of a single surgeon series of all patients undergoing partial nephrectomy using a supra 12th rib miniflank incision with zero ischaemia. Data of seventy one patients who underwent a partial nephrectomy over an 82-month period were analyzed. Data analyzed included operative time, estimated blood loss, pre and postoperative renal function, complications, final pathological characteristics, and tumour size.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy one partial nephrectomies were performed from February 2009 to October 2015. None were converted to radical nephrectomy. Mean operative time was 72 minutes (range 30-250), and mean estimated blood loss was 608 mls (range 100-2500) with one patient receiving blood transfusion. The mean pre and postoperative haemoglobin levels were 144 and 112 g/l. The mean pre and postoperative creatinine levels were 82 and 103 Umol/L. There were 8 Clavian-Dindo Grade 2 complications and 1 major complication (Clavian IIIa). Histology confirmed 24 benign lesions and 47 malignant lesions, 46 cT1a lesions, 24 cT1b lesions, and 1 cT2 lesion. Median follow-up was 38 months with no local recurrence or progression of disease with 5 patients having a positive margin (7%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results demonstrate that a supra 12th miniflank incision open partial nephrectomy with zero ischaemic time for SRMs has satisfactory outcomes with preservation of renal function. A minimally invasive open partial nephrectomy remains an important option for units that cannot offer patients a laparoscopic or a robotic procedure.",9
261,Surgical training fit for the future: the need for a change,"Postgraduate training in surgical specialties is one of the longest training programmes in the medical field. Most of the surgical training programmes require 5-6 years of postgraduate training to become qualified. This is usually followed by 1-2 years of fellowship training in a subspecialised interest. This has been the case for the last 20-30 years with no significant change. The surgical practice is transforming quickly due to the advances in medical technology. This transformation is not matched in the postgraduate training, there is minimal exposure to the new technological advances in early years of postgraduate training. The current postgraduate training in surgical specialties is not fit for the future. Early exposure to robotic and artificial intelligence technologies is required. To achieve this, a significant transformation of surgical training is necessary, which requires a new vision and involves significant investment. We discuss the need for this transformation in the postgraduate surgical specialties training and analyse the threats and opportunities in relation to this transformation.",1
262,Use and evaluation of assistive technologies for upper limb function in tetraplegia,"Context:
        
      
      More than half of all spinal cord injuries (SCI) occur at the cervical level leading to loss of upper limb function, restricted activity and reduced independence. Several technologies have been developed to assist with upper limb functions in the SCI population.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      There is no clear clinical consensus on the effectiveness of the current assistive technologies for the cervical SCI population, hence this study reviews the literature in the years between 1999 and 2019.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was performed on the state-of-the-art assistive technology that supports and improves the function of impaired upper limbs in cervical SCI populations. Combinations of terms, covering assistive technology, SCI, and upper limb, were used in the search, which resulted in a total of 1770 articles. Data extractions were performed on the selected studies which involved summarizing details on the assistive technologies, characteristics of study participants, outcome measures, and improved upper limb functions when using the device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 24 articles were found and grouped into five categories, including neuroprostheses (invasive and non-invasive), orthotic devices, hybrid systems, robots, and arm supports. Only a few selected studies comprehensively reported characteristics of the participants. There was a wide range of outcome measures and all studies reported improvements in upper limb function with the devices.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study highlighted that assistive technologies can improve functions of the upper limbs in SCI patients. It was challenging to draw generalizable conclusions because of factors, such as heterogeneity of recruited participants, a wide range of outcome measures, and the different technologies employed.",1
263,"Sparrowhawk movement, calling, and presence of dead conspecifics differentially impact blue tit ( Cyanistes caeruleus) vocal and behavioral mobbing responses","Abstract:
        
      
      Many animals alter their anti-predator behavior in accordance to the threat level of a predator. While much research has examined variation in mobbing responses to different predators, few studies have investigated how anti-predator behavior is affected by changes in a predator's own state or behavior. We examined the effect of sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) behavior on the mobbing response of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) using robotic taxidermy sparrowhawks. We manipulated whether the simulated predator moved its head, produced vocalizations, or held a taxidermy blue tit in its talons. When any sparrowhawk model was present, blue tits decreased foraging and increased anti-predator behavior and vocalizations. Additionally, each manipulation of the model predator's state (moving, vocalizing, or the presence of a dead conspecific) impacted different types of blue tit anti-predator behavior and vocalizations. These results indicate that different components of mobbing vary according to the specific state of a given predator-beyond its presence or absence-and suggest that each might play a different role in the overall mobbing response. Last, our results indicate that using more life-like predator stimuli-those featuring simple head movements and audio playback of vocalizations-changes how prey respond to the predator; these 'robo-raptor' models provide a powerful tool to provide increased realism in simulated predator encounters without sacrificing experimental control.
    


          Significance statement:
        
      
      Anti-predatory behavior is often modulated by the threat level posed by a particular predator. While much research has tested how different types of predators change prey behavior, few experiments have examined how predator behavior affects anti-predatory responses of prey. By experimentally manipulating robotic predators, we show that blue tits not only respond to the presence of a sparrowhawk, by decreasing feeding and increasing anti-predator behavior and vocalizations, but that they vary specific anti-predator behaviors when encountering differently behaving predators (moving, vocalizing, or those with captured prey), suggesting that prey pay attention to their predators' state and behavior.",4
264,Surgical data science - from concepts toward clinical translation,"Recent developments in data science in general and machine learning in particular have transformed the way experts envision the future of surgery. Surgical Data Science (SDS) is a new research field that aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare through the capture, organization, analysis and modeling of data. While an increasing number of data-driven approaches and clinical applications have been studied in the fields of radiological and clinical data science, translational success stories are still lacking in surgery. In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.",0
265,An in vitro analysis of medial structures and a medial soft tissue reconstruction in a constrained condylar total knee arthroplasty,"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to quantify the medial soft tissue contributions to stability following constrained condylar (CC) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and determine whether a medial reconstruction could restore stability to a soft tissue-deficient, CC-TKA knee.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight cadaveric knees were mounted in a robotic system and tested at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion with ±50 N anterior-posterior force, ±8 Nm varus-valgus, and ±5 Nm internal-external torque. The deep and superficial medial collateral ligaments (dMCL, sMCL) and posteromedial capsule (PMC) were transected and their relative contributions to stabilising the applied loads were quantified. After complete medial soft tissue transection, a reconstruction using a semitendinosus tendon graft was performed, and the effect on kinematic behaviour under equivocal conditions was measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the CC-TKA knee, the sMCL was the major medial restraint in anterior drawer, internal-external, and valgus rotation. No significant differences were found between the rotational laxities of the reconstructed knee to the pre-deficient state for the arc of motion examined. The relative contribution of the reconstruction was higher in valgus rotation at 60° than the sMCL; otherwise, the contribution of the reconstruction was similar to that of the sMCL.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is contention whether a CC-TKA can function with medial deficiency or more constraint is required. This work has shown that a CC-TKA may not provide enough stability with an absent sMCL. However, in such cases, combining the CC-TKA with a medial soft tissue reconstruction may be considered as an alternative to a hinged implant.",8
266,Hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic renal disease: Challenges of interventional treatment,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide, recognized as the fourth most common cause of cancer related death. Many risk factors, leading to liver cirrhosis and associated HCC, have been recognized, among them viral hepatitis infections play an important role worldwide. Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those on maintenance dialysis, show a higher prevalence of viral hepatitis than the general population what increases the risk of HCC onset. In addition, renal dysfunction may have a negative prognostic impact on both immediate and long-term outcomes after malignancy treatment. Several interventional procedures for the treatment of HCC are currently available: thermal ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, liver surgery or even liver transplantation. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system provides an evidence-based treatment algorithm to address different categories of patients to the most-effective treatment in consideration of the extension of disease, liver function and performance status. Liver resection and transplantation are usually reserved to patients with early stage HCC and acceptable performance status, while the other treatments are more indicated in case of impaired liver function or locally advanced or unresectable tumors. However, there is no validated treatment algorithm for HCC in CKD patients, mainly due to the rarity of reports in this cohort of patients. Hereby we discuss the available evidences on interventional HCC treatments in CKD patients, and briefly report up-to-date pharmacological therapy for HCC patients affected by viral hepatitis.",0
267,Rapid Detection of Emerging Pathogens and Loss of Microbial Diversity Associated with Severe Lung Disease in Cystic Fibrosis,"Respiratory infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) is polymicrobial, but standard sputum microbiology does not account for the lung microbiome or detect changes in microbial diversity associated with disease. As a clinically applicable CF microbiome surveillance scheme, total sputum nucleic acids isolated by a standard high-throughput robotic method for accredited viral diagnosis were profiled for bacterial diversity using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) PCR. Conventional culture and RISA were performed on 200 paired sputum samples from 93 CF adults; pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was applied to 59 patients to systematically determine bacterial diversity. Compared to the microbiology data, RISA profiles clustered into two groups: the emerging nonfermenting Gram-negative organisms (eNFGN) and Pseudomonas groups. Patients who were culture positive for Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Ralstonia clustered within the eNFGN group. Pseudomonas group RISA profiles were associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture-positive patients. Sequence analysis confirmed the abundance of eNFGN genera and Pseudomonas within these respective groups. Low bacterial diversity was associated with severe lung disease (P < 0.001) and the presence of Burkholderia (P < 0.001). An absence of Streptococcus (P < 0.05) occurred in individuals with lung function in the lowest quartile. In summary, nucleic acids isolated from CF sputum can serve as a single template for both molecular virology and bacteriology, with a RISA PCR rapidly detecting the presence of dominant eNFGN pathogens or P. aeruginosa missed by culture (11% of cases). We provide guidance for how this straightforward CF microbiota profiling scheme may be adopted by clinical laboratories.",0
268,Standardised approach to laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: a prospective multi-centre analysis,"Purpose:
        
      
      Two non-inferiority randomised control trials have questioned the utility of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer by failing to prove that pathological markers of high-quality surgery are equivalent to those achieved by open technique. We present short- and long-term post-operative outcomes from the largest single surgeon series of consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer. We describe the standardised laparoscopic technique developed by the principal surgeon, and the short-term outcomes from three surgeons who were trained in and subsequently adopted the same approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prospectively acquired data from consecutive patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer by the principal surgeon at the minimally invasive colorectal unit in Portsmouth between 2006 and 2014 were analysed along with data acquired between 2010 and 2017 from surgeons at three further international centres. Endpoints were overall and disease-free survival at 5 years, and early post-operative clinical and pathological outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Two hundred sixty-three consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic TME surgery by the principal surgeon. At 5 years, overall survival was 82.9% (Dukes' A = 94.4%; B = 81.6%; C = 73.7%); disease-free survival was 84.0% (Dukes' A = 93.3%; B = 86.8%; C = 72.6%). Post-operative length of stay, lymph node harvest, mean operating time, rate of conversion, major morbidity and 30-day mortality were not significantly different between the principal surgeon and those he had trained when subsequently in independent practices.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Laparoscopic TME produces excellent long-term survival outcomes for patients with rectal cancer. A standardised approach has the potential to improve outcomes by setting benchmarks for surgical quality, and providing a step-by-step method for surgical training.",9
269,"Comparative Effectiveness Analyses of Salvage Prostatectomy and Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes Following Focal or Whole-Gland Ablative Therapy (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound, Cryotherapy or Electroporation) for Localised Prostate Cancer","Aims:
        
      
      Ablative therapy, such as focal therapy, cryotherapy or electroporation, aims to treat clinically significant prostate cancer with reduced treatment-related toxicity. Up to a third of patients may require further local salvage treatment after ablative therapy failure. Limited descriptive, but no comparative, evidence exists between different salvage treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare oncological and functional outcomes after salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (SRARP) and salvage radiotherapy (SRT).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively on 100 consecutive SRARP cases and 100 consecutive SRT cases after ablative therapy failure in a high-volume tertiary centre.
    


          Results:
        
      
      High-risk patients were over-represented in the SRARP group (66.0%) compared with the SRT group (48.0%) (P = 0.013). The median (interquartile range) follow-up after SRARP was 16.5 (10.0-30.0) months and 37.0 (18.5-64.0) months after SRT. SRT appeared to confer greater biochemical recurrence-free survival at 1, 2 and 3 years compared with SRARP in high-risk patients (year 3: 86.3% versus 66.0%), but biochemical recurrence-free survival was similar for intermediate-risk patients (year 3: 90.0% versus 75.6%). There was no statistical difference in pad-free continence at 12 and 24 months between SRARP (77.2 and 84.7%) and SRT (75.0 and 74.0%) (P = 0.724, 0.114). Erectile function was more likely to be preserved in men who underwent SRT. After SRT, cumulative bowel and urinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity grade I were 25.0 and 45.0%, grade II were 11.0 and 11.0% and grade III or IV complications were 4.0 and 5.0%, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We report the first comparative analyses of salvage prostatectomy and radiotherapy following ablative therapy. Men with high-risk disease appear to have superior oncological outcomes after SRT; however, treatment allocation does not appear to influence oncological outcomes for men with intermediate-risk disease. Treatment allocation was associated with a different spectrum of toxicity profile. Our data may inform shared decision-making when considering salvage treatment following focal or whole-gland ablative therapy.",2
270,Clinical outcomes of kinematic alignment versus mechanical alignment in total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review,"Although mechanical alignment (MA) has traditionally been considered the gold standard, the optimal alignment strategy for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still debated.Kinematic alignment (KA) aims to restore native alignment by respecting the three axes of rotation of the knee and thereby producing knee motion more akin to the native knee.Designer surgeon case series and case control studies have demonstrated excellent subjective and objective clinical outcomes as well as survivorship for KA TKA with up to 10 years follow up, but these results have not been reproduced in high-quality randomized clinical trials.Gait analyses have demonstrated differences in parameters such as knee adduction, extension and external rotation moments, the relevance of which needs further evaluation.Objective improvements in soft tissue balance using KA have not been shown to result in improvements in patient-reported outcomes measures.Technologies that permit accurate reproduction of implant positioning and objective measurement of soft tissue balance, such as robotic-assisted TKA and compartmental pressure sensors, may play an important role in improving our understanding of the optimum alignment strategy and implant position.

271,Training value of laparoscopic colorectal videos on the World Wide Web: a pilot study on the educational quality of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy videos,"Introduction:
        
      
      Instructive laparoscopy videos with appropriate exposition could be ideal for initial training in laparoscopic surgery, but unfortunately there are no guidelines for annotating these videos or agreed methods to measure the educational content and the safety of the procedure presented. Aim of this study is to systematically search the World Wide Web to determine the availability of laparoscopic colorectal surgery videos and to objectively establish their potential training value.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A search for laparoscopic right hemicolectomy videos was performed on the three most used English language web search engines Google.com, Bing.com, and Yahoo.com; moreover, a survey among 25 local trainees was performed to identify additional websites for inclusion. All laparoscopic right hemicolectomy videos with an English language title were included. Videos of open surgery, single incision laparoscopic surgery, robotic, and hand-assisted surgery were excluded. The safety of the demonstrated procedure was assessed with a validated competency assessment tool specifically designed for laparoscopic colorectal surgery and data on the educational content of the video were extracted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one websites were identified and 182 surgical videos were included. One hundred and seventy-three videos (95%) detailed the year of publication; this demonstrated a significant increase in the number of videos published per year from 2009. Characteristics of the patient were rarely presented, only 10 videos (5.4%) reported operating time and only 6 videos (3.2%) reported 30-day morbidity; 34 videos (18.6%) underwent a peer-review process prior to publication. Formal case presentation, the presence of audio narration, the use of diagrams, and snapshots and a step-by-step approach are all characteristics of peer-reviewed videos but no significant difference was found in the safety of the procedure.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Laparoscopic videos can be a useful adjunct to operative training. There is a large and increasing amount of material available for free on the internet, but this is currently unregulated.",3
272,Impact of operation duration on postoperative outcomes of minimally-invasive right colectomy,"Aim:
        
      
      Operation time (OT) is a key operational factor influencing surgical outcomes. The present study aimed to analyse whether OT impacts on short-term outcomes of minimally-invasive right colectomies by assessing the role of surgical approach (robotic [RRC] or laparoscopic right colectomy [LRC]), and type of ileocolic anastomosis (i.e., intracorporal [IA] or extra-corporal anastomosis [EA]).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective analysis of the Minimally-invasivE surgery for oncological Right ColectomY (MERCY) Study Group database, which included adult patients with nonmetastatic right colon adenocarcinoma operated on by oncological RRC or LRC between January 2014 and December 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study sample was composed of 1549 patients who were divided into three groups according to the OT quartiles: (1) First quartile, <135 min (n = 386); (2) Second and third quartiles, 135-199 min (n = 731); and (3) Fourth quartile ≥200 min (n = 432). The majority (62.7%) were LRC-EA, followed by LRC-IA (24.3%), RRC-IA (11.1%), and RRC-EA (1.9%). Independent predictors of an OT ≥ 200 min included male gender, age, obesity, diabetes, use of indocyanine green fluorescence, and IA confection. An OT ≥ 200 min was significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative noninfective complications (AOR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.15-2.13; p = 0.004), whereas the surgical approach and the type of anastomosis had no impact on postoperative morbidity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Prolonged OT is independently associated with increased odds of postoperative noninfective complications in oncological minimally-invasive right colectomy.",9
273,Implementation of the Exeter enhanced recovery programme for patients undergoing radical cystectomy,"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe our experience with the implementation and refinement of an enhanced recovery programme (ERP) for radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion. To assess the impact on length of stay (LOS), complication and readmission rates.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      In all, 165 consecutive patients undergoing open RC (ORC) and urinary diversion between January 2008 and April 2013 were entered into an ERP. A retrospective case note review was undertaken. Outcomes recorded included LOS, time to mobilisation, complication rates within the first 30 days (Clavien-Dindo classification) and readmissions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients were successfully entered into the ERP. As enhanced recovery principles became embedded in the unit, LOS reduced from a mean of 14 days over the initial year of the ERP to a mean of 9.2 days. The complication rate was 6.6% for Clavien ≥3, and 43.5% for Clavien ≤2. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.2%. The 30-day readmission rate was 13.9%. In the most contemporary subset of 52 patients: the median time after ORC to sit out of bed, mobilise and open bowels was day 1, 2 and 6, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The ERP described for patients undergoing ORC appears to be safe. Benefits include early feeding, mobilisation and hospital discharge. The ERP will continue to develop with the incorporation of advancing evidence and technology, in particular the introduction of robot-assisted RC.",2
274,Laparoscopic intragastric resection of gastric synovial sarcoma: report of the first ever case with video demonstration,"Background:
        
      
      Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare soft tissue tumor. Among different anatomical locations where it can be found, gastric localization is a very uncommon one. Based on soft tissue sarcoma guidelines, complete tumor excision is considered the main treatment approach. Depending on size and localization of the tumor, both wedge and major gastric resections have been performed in the past for the treatment of this condition.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      We present the case of a 43-year-old woman who underwent a laparoscopic intragastric excision of a gastric 10-mm SS located nearby the esophagogastric junction. Pathology examination confirmed the presence of a SS. The resected specimen confirmed margin-free excision of a monophasic spindle cell neoplasm invading the submucosa and presenting the rearrangement of SS18 gene at fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). No adjuvant treatment was offered, and 18 months after surgery, the patient was alive and disease free.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This represents the first case reported in literature of a laparoscopic intragastric resection for a gastric SS. This approach allowed to obtain a full thickness radical tumor resection with the advantages of minimally invasive and organ preserving surgery.",3
275,Resting state MEG oscillations show long-range temporal correlations of phase synchrony that break down during finger movement,"The capacity of the human brain to interpret and respond to multiple temporal scales in its surroundings suggests that its internal interactions must also be able to operate over a broad temporal range. In this paper, we utilize a recently introduced method for characterizing the rate of change of the phase difference between MEG signals and use it to study the temporal structure of the phase interactions between MEG recordings from the left and right motor cortices during rest and during a finger-tapping task. We use the Hilbert transform to estimate moment-to-moment fluctuations of the phase difference between signals. After confirming the presence of scale-invariance we estimate the Hurst exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). An exponent of >0.5 is indicative of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the signal. We find that LRTCs are present in the α/μ and β frequency bands of resting state MEG data. We demonstrate that finger movement disrupts LRTCs correlations, producing a phase relationship with a structure similar to that of Gaussian white noise. The results are validated by applying the same analysis to data with Gaussian white noise phase difference, recordings from an empty scanner and phase-shuffled time series. We interpret the findings through comparison of the results with those we obtained from an earlier study during which we adopted this method to characterize phase relationships within a Kuramoto model of oscillators in its sub-critical, critical, and super-critical synchronization states. We find that the resting state MEG from left and right motor cortices shows moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase difference with a similar temporal structure to that of a system of Kuramoto oscillators just prior to its critical level of coupling, and that finger tapping moves the system away from this pre-critical state toward a more random state.",4
276,Defining Global Benchmarks for Laparoscopic Liver Resections: An International Multicenter Study,"Objective:
        
      
      To establish global benchmark outcomes indicators after laparoscopic liver resections (L-LR).
    


          Background:
        
      
      There is limited published data to date on the best achievable outcomes after L-LR.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a post hoc analysis of a multicenter database of 11,983 patients undergoing L-LR in 45 international centers in 4 continents between 2015 and 2020. Three specific procedures: left lateral sectionectomy (LLS), left hepatectomy (LH), and right hepatectomy (RH) were selected to represent the 3 difficulty levels of L-LR. Fifteen outcome indicators were selected to establish benchmark cutoffs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were 3519 L-LR (LLS, LH, RH) of which 1258 L-LR (40.6%) cases performed in 34 benchmark expert centers qualified as low-risk benchmark cases. These included 659 LLS (52.4%), 306 LH (24.3%), and 293 RH (23.3%). The benchmark outcomes established for operation time, open conversion rate, blood loss ≥500 mL, blood transfusion rate, postoperative morbidity, major morbidity, and 90-day mortality after LLS, LH, and RH were 209.5, 302, and 426 minutes; 2.1%, 13.4%, and 13.0%; 3.2%, 20%, and 47.1%; 0%, 7.1%, and 10.5%; 11.1%, 20%, and 50%; 0%, 7.1%, and 20%; and 0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study established the first global benchmark outcomes for L-LR in a large-scale international patient cohort. It provides an up-to-date reference regarding the ""best achievable"" results for L-LR for which centers adopting L-LR can use as a comparison to enable an objective assessment of performance gaps and learning curves.",9
277,Surgical management of head and neck cancers: implications for dental practitioners,"Surgery remains an important, often primary, treatment modality in the management of head and neck cancers (HNCs). Malignant disease of the oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx may all be treated by surgery alone, or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.Recent decades have seen significant advances in the surgical management of HNC. Refinement of surgical technique (particularly in microvascular surgery), improved training standards, advances in peri-operative care and more recent innovations, including transoral robotic surgery, have resulted in better survival and quality of life outcomes.This paper provides the dental practitioner with an overview of common surgical procedures used in the management of HNC, with an emphasis on the management of squamous cell cancers affecting the oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. Throughout, there is an emphasis on the implications for the dental team of cancer and its surgical management, at each of these anatomical sites.",0
278,Biomechanical Assessment of a Distally Fixed Lateral Extra-articular Augmentation Procedure in the Treatment of Anterolateral Rotational Laxity of the Knee,"Background:
        
      
      Most lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) procedures rely on passing a strip of the iliotibial band (ITB) under the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament and fixing it proximally to the femur. The Ellison procedure is a distally fixed lateral extra-articular augmentation procedure with no proximal fixation of the ITB. It has the potential advantages of maintaining a dynamic element of control of knee rotation and avoiding the possibility of overconstraint.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      The modified Ellison procedure would restore native knee kinematics after sectioning of the anterolateral capsule, and closure of the ITB defect would decrease rotational laxity of the knee.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Controlled laboratory study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested in a 6 degrees of freedom robotic system through 0° to 90° of knee flexion to assess anteroposterior, internal rotation (IR), and external rotation laxities. A simulated pivot shift (SPS) was performed at 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45° of flexion. Kinematic testing was performed in the intact knee and anterolateral capsule-injured knee and after the modified Ellison procedure, with and without closure of the ITB defect. A novel pulley system was used to load the ITB at 30 N for all testing states. Statistical analysis used repeated measures analyses of variance and paired t tests with Bonferroni adjustments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sectioning of the anterolateral capsule increased anterior drawer and IR during isolated displacement and with the SPS (mean increase, 2° of IR; P < .05). The modified Ellison procedure reduced both isolated and coupled IR as compared with the sectioned state (P < .05). During isolated testing, IR was reduced close to that of the intact state with the modified Ellison procedure, except at 30° of knee flexion, when it was slightly overconstrained. During the SPS, IR with the closed modified Ellison was less than that in the intact state at 15° and 30° of flexion. No significant differences in knee kinematics were seen between the ITB defect open and closed.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A distally fixed lateral augmentation procedure can closely restore knee laxities to native values in an anterolateral capsule-sectioned knee. Although the modified Ellison did result in overconstraint to isolated IR and coupled IR during SPS, this occurred only in the early range of knee flexion. Closure of the ITB defect had no effect on knee kinematics.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      A distally fixed lateral extra-articular augmentation procedure provides an alternative to a proximally fixed LET and can reduce anterolateral laxity in the anterolateral capsule-injured knee and restore kinematics close to the intact state.",8
279,Calibration of arterial spin labeling data-potential pitfalls in post-processing,"Purpose:
        
      
      To assess the impact of the different post-processing options in the calibration of arterial spin labeling (ASL) data on perfusion quantification and its reproducibility.
    


          Theory and methods:
        
      
      Absolute quantification of perfusion measurements is one of the promises of ASL techniques. However, it is highly dependent on a calibration procedure that involves a complex processing pipeline for which no standardized procedure has been fully established. In this work, we systematically compare the main ASL calibration methods as well as various post-processing calibration options, using 2 data sets acquired with the most common sequences, pulsed ASL and pseudo-continuous ASL.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significant and sometimes large discrepancies in ASL perfusion quantification were obtained when using different post-processing calibration options. Nevertheless, when using a set of theoretically based and carefully chosen options, only small differences were observed for both reference tissue and voxelwise methods. The voxelwise and white matter reference tissue methods were less sensitive to post-processing options than the cerebrospinal fluid reference tissue method. However, white matter reference tissue calibration also produced poorer reproducibility results. Moreover, it may also not be an appropriate reference in case of white matter pathology.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Poor post-processing calibration options can lead to large errors in perfusion quantification, and a complete description of the calibration procedure should therefore be reported in ASL studies. Overall, our results further support the voxelwise calibration method proposed by the ASL white paper, particularly given the advantage of being relatively simple to implement and intrinsically correcting for the coil sensitivity profile.",0
280,Association of Residents' Neural Signatures With Stress Resilience During Surgery,"Importance:
        
      
      Intraoperative stressors may compound cognitive load, prompting performance decline and threatening patient safety. However, not all surgeons cope equally well with stress, and the disparity between performance stability and decline under high cognitive demand may be characterized by differences in activation within brain areas associated with attention and concentration such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare PFC activation between surgeons demonstrating stable performance under temporal stress with those exhibiting stress-related performance decline.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Cohort study conducted from July 2015 to September 2016 at the Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, England. One hundred two surgical residents (postgraduate year 1 and greater) were invited to participate, of which 33 agreed to partake.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Participants performed a laparoscopic suturing task under 2 conditions: self-paced (SP; without time-per-knot restrictions), and time pressure (TP; 2-minute per knot time restriction).
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      A composite deterioration score was computed based on between-condition differences in task performance metrics (task progression score [arbitrary units], error score [millimeters], leak volume [milliliters], and knot tensile strength [newtons]). Based on the composite score, quartiles were computed reflecting performance stability (quartile 1 [Q1]) and decline (quartile 4 [Q4]). Changes in PFC oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (HbO2) measured at 24 different locations using functional near-infrared spectroscopy were compared between Q1 and Q4. Secondary outcomes included subjective workload (Surgical Task Load Index) and heart rate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 33 participants, the median age was 33 years, the range was 29 to 56 years, and 27 were men (82%). The Q1 residents demonstrated task-induced increases in HbO2 across the bilateral ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and right dorsolateral PFC in the SP condition and in the VLPFC in the TP condition. In contrast, Q4 residents demonstrated decreases in HbO2 in both conditions. The magnitude of PFC activation (change in HbO2) was significantly greater in Q1 than Q4 across the bilateral VLPFC during both SP (mean [SD] left VLPFC: Q1, 0.44 [1.30] μM; Q4, -0.21 [2.05] μM; P < .001; right VLPFC: Q1, 0.46 [1.12] μM; Q4, -0.15 [2.14] μM; P < .001) and TP (mean [SD] left VLPFC: Q1, 0.44 [1.36] μM; Q4, -0.03 [1.83] μM; P = .001; right VLPFC: Q1, 0.49 [1.70] μM; Q4, -0.32 [2.00] μM; P < .001) conditions. There were no significant between-group differences in Surgical Task Load Index or heart rate in either condition.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Performance stability within TP is associated with sustained prefrontal activation indicative of preserved attention and concentration, whereas performance decline is associated with prefrontal deactivation that may represent task disengagement.",4
281,Cam Osteochondroplasty for Femoroacetabular Impingement Increases Microinstability in Deep Flexion: A Cadaveric Study,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this in vitro cadaveric study was to examine the contributions of each surgical stage during cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) surgery (i.e., intact-cam hip, T-capsulotomy, cam resection, and capsular repair) toward hip range of motion, translation, and microinstability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve cadaveric cam hips were denuded to the capsule and mounted onto a robotic tester. The hips were positioned in several flexion positions-full extension, neutral (0°), 30° of flexion, and 90° of flexion-and performed internal-external rotations to 5 Nm of torque in each position. The hips underwent a series of surgical stages (T-capsulotomy, cam resection, and capsular repair) and were retested after each stage. Changes in range of motion, translation, and microinstability (overall translation normalized by femoral head radius) were measured after each stage.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Regarding range of motion, cam resection increased internal rotation at 90° of flexion (change in internal rotation = +6°, P = .001) but did not affect external rotation. Capsular repair restrained external rotation compared with the cam resection stage (change in external rotation = -8° to -4°, P ≤ .04). In terms of translation, the hip translated after cam resection at 90° of flexion in the medial-lateral plane (change in translation = +1.9 mm, P = .04) relative to the intact and capsulotomy stages. Regarding microinstability, capsulotomy increased microinstability in 30° of flexion (change in microinstability [ΔM] = +0.05, P = .003), but microinstability did not further increase after cam resection. At 90° of flexion, microinstability did not increase after capsulotomy (ΔM = +0.03, P = .2) but substantially increased after cam resection (ΔM = +0.08, P = .03), accounting for a 31% change with respect to the intact stage.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Cam resection increased microinstability by 31% during deep hip flexion relative to the intact hip. This finding suggests that iatrogenic microinstability may be due to separation of the labral seal and resected contour of the femoral head.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      Our in vitro study showed that, at time zero and prior to postoperative recovery, excessive motion after cam resection could disrupt the labral seal. Complete cam resection should be performed cautiously to avoid disruption of the labral seal and postoperative microinstability.",3
282,Dissociable Learning Processes Underlie Human Pain Conditioning,"Pavlovian conditioning underlies many aspects of pain behavior, including fear and threat detection [1], escape and avoidance learning [2], and endogenous analgesia [3]. Although a central role for the amygdala is well established [4], both human and animal studies implicate other brain regions in learning, notably ventral striatum and cerebellum [5]. It remains unclear whether these regions make different contributions to a single aversive learning process or represent independent learning mechanisms that interact to generate the expression of pain-related behavior. We designed a human parallel aversive conditioning paradigm in which different Pavlovian visual cues probabilistically predicted thermal pain primarily to either the left or right arm and studied the acquisition of conditioned Pavlovian responses using combined physiological recordings and fMRI. Using computational modeling based on reinforcement learning theory, we found that conditioning involves two distinct types of learning process. First, a non-specific ""preparatory"" system learns aversive facial expressions and autonomic responses such as skin conductance. The associated learning signals-the learned associability and prediction error-were correlated with fMRI brain responses in amygdala-striatal regions, corresponding to the classic aversive (fear) learning circuit. Second, a specific lateralized system learns ""consummatory"" limb-withdrawal responses, detectable with electromyography of the arm to which pain is predicted. Its related learned associability was correlated with responses in ipsilateral cerebellar cortex, suggesting a novel computational role for the cerebellum in pain. In conclusion, our results show that the overall phenotype of conditioned pain behavior depends on two dissociable reinforcement learning circuits.",4
283,Organisation of Prostate Cancer Services in the English National Health Service,"Aims:
        
      
      The National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA) started in April 2013 with the aim of assessing the process of care and its outcomes in men diagnosed with prostate cancer in England and Wales. One of the key aims of the audit was to assess the configuration and availability of specialist prostate cancer services in England.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In 2014, the NPCA undertook an organisational survey of all 143 acute National Health Service (NHS) Trusts and 48 specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) hubs cross England. Questionnaires established the availability and location of core diagnostic, treatment and patient-centred support services for the management of non-metastatic prostate cancer in addition to specific diagnostic and treatment procedures that reflect the continuing evolution of prostate cancer management, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and stereotactic body radiotherapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The survey received a 100% response rate. The results showed considerable geographical variation with respect to the availability of core treatment modalities, the size of the target population and catchment areas served by specialist MDT hubs, as well as in the uptake of additional procedures and services. Specifically there are gaps in the availability of core radiotherapy procedures; high dose rate and low dose rate brachytherapy are available in 44% and 75% of specialist MDTs, respectively. By comparison, there seems to be a relative 'over-penetration' of surgical innovation, with 67% of specialist MDTs providing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and 21% HIFU. There is also evidence of increased centralisation of core surgical procedures and regional inequity in the availability of surgical innovation across England.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The organisational survey of the NPCA has provided a comprehensive assessment of the structure and function of specialist MDTs in England and the availability of prostate cancer procedures and services. As part of the prospective audit, the NPCA will assess the effect of the availability of prostate cancer services on access regionally and subsequent outcomes of care according to evidence-based guidelines.",2
284,Adapting a drug screening platform to discover associations of molecular targeted radiosensitizers with genomic biomarkers,"Large collections of annotated cancer cell lines are powerful tools for precisely matching targeted drugs with genomic alterations that can be tested as biomarkers in the clinic. Whether these screening platforms, which utilize short-term cell survival to assess drug responses, can be applied to precision radiation medicine is not established. To this end, 32 cancer cell lines were screened using 18 targeted therapeutic agents with known or putative radiosensitizing properties (227 combinations). The cell number remaining after drug exposure with or without radiation was assessed by nonclonogenic assays. We derived short-term radiosensitization factors (SRF2Gy) and calculated clonogenic survival assay-based dose enhancement factors (DEFSF0.1). Radiosensitization was characterized by SRF2Gy values of mostly ∼1.05 to 1.2 and significantly correlated with drug-induced changes in apoptosis and senescence frequencies. SRF2Gy was significantly correlated with DEFSF0.1, with a respective sensitivity and specificity of 91.7% and 81.5% for a 3-day endpoint, and 82.8% and 84.2% for a robotic 5-day assay. KRAS mutations (codons 12/13) were found to be a biomarker of radiosensitization by midostaurin in lung cancer, which was pronounced under conditions that enriched for stem cell-like cells. In conclusion, although short-term proliferation/survival assays cannot replace the gold-standard clonogenic survival assay for measuring cellular radiosensitivity, they capture with high accuracy the relative change in radiosensitivity that is caused by a radiosensitzing targeted agent.
    


          Implications:
        
      
      This study supports a paradigm shift regarding the utility of short-term assays for precision radiation medicine, which should facilitate the identification of genomic biomarkers to guide the testing of novel drug/radiation combinations.",0
285,Simulation training in upper tract endourology: myth or reality?,"Surgeons training in the twenty-first century are subject to a myriad of pressures, as has always been the case within surgical training. These include reduced hours available for training and increased threat of litigation against their operating practice. The Halstedian approach of ""see one, do one, teach one"" has been replaced within surgical training and simulation has become established to enable urology trainees to develop technical and non-technical skills away from the operating room. With the primary focus as patient safety and increasing operating skill, ""simulation training"" encompasses several modalities. These include wet-lab cadaveric and animal models, dry lab, high fidelity, low-fidelity and virtual reality (VR). These can be used to practice generic surgical skills, such as laparoscopic suturing or knot tying on a robotic console. Beyond this there is potential for simulation training courses and full-immersion simulation to address non-technical skills and team aspects within the operating room. To incorporate simulators into training, models must be carefully designed and evaluated according to certain considerations, ensuring that they address parameters such as face, content and construct validity. This review aimed to provide an overview of simulation platforms available within endourology, considering ureterorenoscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy and the status of their validation.",3
286,Self-assembling peptide haemostatic gel reduces incidence of pelvic collection after total mesorectal excision: Prospective cohort study,"Background:
        
      
      Pelvic surgery has the potential to leave behind a large raw surface, which can bleed and ooze postoperatively. The adoption of precision surgical approach for rectal cancers has led to reduction in blood loss. We aimed to assess 1) the feasibility and 2) the safety of using a self-assembling peptide (SAP) haemostatic agent (PuraStat®) after rectal cancer surgery to reduce the incidence of pelvic collections.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This prospective cohort pilot study compared the results of 25 consecutive cases of total mesorectal excision (TME) with use of 5-10 ml of SAP, and 25 consecutive cases without PuraStat® application (CON, control group). The groups were compared for complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III and IV classification), postoperative drain output and length of hospital stay (LOS). Statistical analysis was carried out using paired samples T test and Fisher's exact test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifty patients (SAP = 25, CON = 25) were enrolled into this study. Mean drain outputs (ml) on day 1, day 2 and day 3 were 60 ± 18, 89 ± 42 and 64 ± 45 in SAP group, and 102 ± 31, 95 ± 52, 66 ± 37 in CON group. This was significantly better for SAP group in day one after surgery. The mean LOS was shorter in SAP group (5.7 versus 7.4 days in CON, p 0.04). Clavien-Dindo III & IV complications were seen in two and five cases respectively (p 0.18). R0 resection rate (p 0.32) and lymph node harvest (p 0.13) were similar in both groups. There were no complications seen in relation to the application of the SAP.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These initial data suggest that SAP is a safe product, and feasible to apply in the pelvis after TME surgery. It appears to shorten the LOS and reduce the postoperative drain output and may reduce the incidence of Clavien-Dindo grade III & IV complications.",9
287,A systematic review of the literature assessing operative blood loss and postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery,"Purpose:
        
      
      There is no consensus in the literature regarding the association between operative blood loss and postoperative outcomes in colorectal surgery, despite evidence suggesting a link. Therefore, this systematic review assesses the association between operative blood loss, perioperative and long-term outcomes after colorectal surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and Cochrane was performed to identify studies reporting on operative blood loss in colorectal surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The review included forty-nine studies reporting on 61,312 participants, with a mean age ranging from 53.4 to 78.1 years. The included studies demonstrated that major operative blood loss was found to be a risk factor for mortality, anastomotic leak, presacral abscess, and postoperative ileus, leading to an increased duration of hospital stay. In the long term, the studies suggest that significant blood loss was an independent risk factor for future small bowel obstruction due to colorectal cancer recurrence and adhesions. Studies found that survival was significantly reduced, whilst the risk of colorectal cancer recurrence was increased. Reoperation and cancer-specific survival were not associated with major blood loss.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results of this systematic review suggest that major operative blood loss increases the risk of perioperative adverse events and has short and long-term repercussions on postoperative outcomes. Laparoscopic and robotic surgery, vessel ligation technology and anaesthetic considerations are essential for reducing blood loss and improving outcomes. This review highlights the need for further high quality, prospective, multicentre trials with a greater number of participants, and accurate and standardised methods of measuring operative blood loss.",5
288,The Future of Rectal Cancer Surgery: A Narrative Review of an International Symposium,"Surgery remains the mainstay of curative treatment for primary rectal cancer. For mid and low rectal tumors, optimal oncologic surgery requires total mesorectal excision (TME) to ensure the tumor and locoregional lymph nodes are removed. Adequacy of surgery is directly linked to survival outcomes and, in particular, local recurrence. From a technical perspective, the more distal the tumor, the more challenging the surgery and consequently, the risk for oncologically incomplete surgery is higher. TME can be performed by an open, laparoscopic, robotic or transanal approach. There is a lack of consensus on the ""gold standard"" approach with each of these options offering specific advantages. The International Symposium on the Future of Rectal Cancer Surgery was convened to discuss the current challenges and future pathways of the 4 approaches for TME. This article reviews the findings and discussion from an expert, international panel.",3
289,[Current practice patterns of perioperative cystectomy management in Germany: a questionnaire survey],"Objective:
        
      
       Radical cystectomy (RCX) is the standard treatment for muscle-invasive and treatment-refractory non-invasive bladder cancer, but that is associated with high morbidity. We now survey current practice patterns on perioperative management among German urological departments of all sizes METHODS: Members of the German Association of Urology and the German Society of Residents in Urology (GeSRU) were contacted by email and asked to answer a 24-item online questionnaire covering clinically relevant aspects of current guidelines and controversies.
    


          Results:
        
      
       Responses were obtained from at least 19 % of all German urological centers. About 60 % performed preoperative staging using CT urography and chest CT. The most common perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was a third generation cephalosporin combined with metronidazole (46 %), administered for a median of 5 days. Stentograms for ileal conduit and neobladder are routinely performed in 38 % and 55 % of patients, respectively. Ureteral stents were usually removed 11 - 12 days after the procedure (ileal conduit and neobladder). Based on the surrogate parameters of preoperative bowel preparation, postoperative start of oral nutrition and use of nasogastric tube, fast-track concepts such as ERAS were not generally established (< 50 %). Robot-assisted cystectomy appears to be performed in 15 % of German urological centers and was associated with the number of performed cystectomies (p < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
       Most aspects of perioperative management in cystectomy patients - staging diagnostics, use of antibiotics, stent removal - are performed in accordance with current guidelines. Other clinical questions such as stent imaging before removal and fast track concepts are handled heterogeneously. Guideline-adherence was not associated with hospital size or number of procedures performed.",1
290,Inference of brain networks with approximate Bayesian computation - assessing face validity with an example application in Parkinsonism,"This paper describes and validates a novel framework using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm for parameter estimation and model selection in models of mesoscale brain network activity. We provide a proof of principle, first pass validation of this framework using a set of neural mass models of the cortico-basal ganglia thalamic circuit inverted upon spectral features from experimental, in vivo recordings. This optimization scheme relaxes an assumption of fixed-form posteriors (i.e. the Laplace approximation) taken in previous approaches to inverse modelling of spectral features. This enables the exploration of model dynamics beyond that approximated from local linearity assumptions and so fit to explicit, numerical solutions of the underlying non-linear system of equations. In this first paper, we establish a face validation of the optimization procedures in terms of: (i) the ability to approximate posterior densities over parameters that are plausible given the known causes of the data; (ii) the ability of the model comparison procedures to yield posterior model probabilities that can identify the model structure known to generate the data; and (iii) the robustness of these procedures to local minima in the face of different starting conditions. Finally, as an illustrative application we show (iv) that model comparison can yield plausible conclusions given the known neurobiology of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit in Parkinsonism. These results lay the groundwork for future studies utilizing highly nonlinear or brittle models that can explain time dependant dynamics, such as oscillatory bursts, in terms of the underlying neural circuits.",0
291,Use of biomedical photonics in gynecological surgery: a uterine transplantation model,"Aim:
        
      
      Uterine transplantation (UTx) has been proposed as a treatment for permanent absolute uterine factor infertility. The study aims were to compare pulse oximetry and multispectral imaging (MSI), for intraoperative tracking of uterine oxygen saturation in animal UTx models (rabbit and sheep).
    


          Results/methodology:
        
      
      Imaging results confirmed the re-establishment of adequate perfusion in the transplanted organ after surgery. Comparison of oxygen saturation values between the pre-UTx donor and post-UTx recipient, and pre-UTx and post-UTx recipient reveals a statistically significant decrease in saturation levels post-UTx.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The use of MSI is the first case in gynecology and has demonstrated promise of possible future human use. MSI technique has advantages over pulse oximetry - it provides spatial information in a real-time, noncontact manner.",0
292,Blind testing cross-linking/mass spectrometry under the auspices of the 11th critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP11),"Determining the structure of a protein by any method requires various contributions from experimental and computational sides. In a recent study, high-density cross-linking/mass spectrometry (HD-CLMS) data in combination with ab initio structure prediction determined the structure of human serum albumin (HSA) domains, with an RMSD to X-ray structure of up to 2.5 Å, or 3.4 Å in the context of blood serum. This paper reports the blind test on the readiness of this technology through the help of Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). We identified between 201-381 unique residue pairs at an estimated 5% FDR (at link level albeit with missing site assignment precision evaluation), for four target proteins. HD-CLMS proved reliable once crystal structures were released. However, improvements in structure prediction using cross-link data were slight. We identified two reasons for this. Spread of cross-links along the protein sequence and the tightness of the spatial constraints must be improved. However, for the selected targets even ideal contact data derived from crystal structures did not allow modellers to arrive at the observed structure. Consequently, the progress of HD-CLMS in conjunction with computational modeling methods as a structure determination method, depends on advances on both arms of this hybrid approach.",0
293,"Comparison Between Minimally Invasive Right Anterior and Right Posterior Sectionectomy vs Right Hepatectomy: An International Multicenter Propensity Score-Matched and Coarsened-Exact-Matched Analysis of 1,100 Patients","Background:
        
      
      The role of minimally invasive right anterior and right posterior sectionectomy (MI-RAS/MI-RPS) for right-sided liver lesions remains debatable. Although technically more demanding, these procedures might result in faster recovery and lower postoperative morbidity compared with minimally invasive right hemihepatectomy.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      This is an international multicenter retrospective analysis of 1,114 patients undergoing minimally invasive right hemihepatectomy, MI-RAS, and MI-RPS at 21 centers between 2006 and 2019. Minimally invasive surgery included pure laparoscopic, robotic, hand-assisted, or a hybrid approach. A propensity-matched and coarsened-exact-matched analysis was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,100 cases met study criteria, of whom 759 underwent laparoscopic, 283 robotic, 11 hand-assisted, and 47 laparoscopic-assisted (hybrid) surgery. There were 632 right hemihepatectomies, 373 right posterior sectionectomies, and 95 right anterior sectionectomies. There were no differences in baseline characteristics after matching. In the MI-RAS/MI-RPS group, median blood loss was higher (400 vs 300 mL, p = 0.001) as well as intraoperative blood transfusion rate (19.6% vs 10.7%, p = 0.004). However, the overall morbidity rate was lower including major morbidity (7.1% vs 14.3%, p = 0.007) and reoperation rate (1.4% vs 4.6%, p = 0.029). The rate of close/involved margins was higher in the MI-RAS/MI-RPS group (23.4% vs 8.9%, p &lt; 0.001). These findings were consistent after both propensity and coarsened-exact matching.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although technically more demanding, MI-RAS/MI-RPS is a valuable alternative for minimally invasive right hemihepatectomy in right-sided liver lesions with lower postoperative morbidity, possibly due to the preservation of parenchyma. However, the rate of close/involved margins is higher in these procedures. These findings might guide surgeons in preoperative counselling and in selecting the appropriate procedure for their patients.",2
294,Imaging modalities and treatment of paediatric upper tract urolithiasis: A systematic review and update on behalf of the EAU urolithiasis guidelines panel,"Background:
        
      
      Prompt diagnosis and treatment of paediatric urolithiasis are required to avoid long term sequelae of renal damage.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review the literature regarding the diagnostic imaging modalities and treatment approaches for paediatric urolithiasis.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 1980-January 2019. 76 full-text articles were included.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ultrasound and Kidney-Ureter-Bladder radiography are the baseline diagnostic examinations. Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) is the second line choice with high sensitivity (97-100%) and specificity (96-100%). Magnetic Resonance Urography accounts only for 2% of pediatric stone imaging studies. Expectant management for single, asymptomatic lower pole renal stones is an acceptable initial approach, especially in patients with non-struvite, non-cystine stones<7 mm. Limited studies exist on medical expulsive therapy as off-label treatment. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is the first-line treatment with overall stone free rates (SFRs) of 70-90%, retreatment rates 4-50% and complication rates up to 15%. Semi-rigid ureteroscopy is effective with SFRs of 81-98%, re-treatment rates of 6.3-10% and complication rates of 1.9-23%. Flexible ureteroscopy has shown SFRs of 76-100%, retreatment rates of 0-19% and complication rates of 0-28%. SFRs after first and second-look percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) are 70.1-97.3% and 84.6-97.5%, respectively with an overall complication rate of 20%. Open surgery is seldom used, while laparoscopy is effective for stones refractory to SWL and PNL. Limited data exist for robot-assisted management.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the initial assessment of paediatric urolithiasis, US is recommended as first imaging modality, while non-contrast CT is the second option. SWL is recommended as first line treatment for renal stones <20 mm and for ureteral stones<10 mm. Ureteroscopy is a feasible alternative both for ureteral stones not amenable to SWL as well as for renal stones <20 mm (using flexible). PNL is recommended for renal stones >20 mm.",1
295,Outcomes of combination therapy with daily tadalafil 5 mg plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg to treat lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction in men with or without metabolic syndrome,"Background:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to assess the impact of tadalafil 5 mg/die plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/die combination therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED), according to presence vs. absence of metabolic syndrome (MetS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Seventy-five consecutive men presenting with ED and LUTS were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to MetS presence. All subjects were treated with combination therapy for 12 weeks. Patients were re-evaluated after treatment with uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume (PVR), International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), IPSS Quality of Life (QoL), overactive bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) and International Index Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) Score.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After enrollment, 50 patients were included: 31 (62.0%) with MetS and 19 (38.0%) without MetS. At baseline, patients without MetS showed a significantly better IPSS, IIEF and OAB-q, as compared to those with MetS. After 12 weeks of combination therapy LUTS, ED and flowmetry significantly improved in both groups (P<0.001). The improvement after 12 weeks was similar between groups in all parameters (P>0.05), except for ∆OAB-q that was significantly better for patients with MetS (P=0.028). Nevertheless, total IPSS, all IPSS subscores and OAB-q were significantly better at 12 weeks in men without MetS (P<0.05). Despite IIEF-5 was significantly different at baseline, after 12 weeks of combination therapy, erectile function was similar in men with or without METS: 16.3±3.8 vs. 17.7±4.7 (P=0.238). No serious adverse event (AE) was reported, and complications were comparable between groups (P>0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with MetS have worse LUTS and ED profiles. However, tadalafil plus tamsulosin combination treatment provided them a similar ED profile and a greater relief of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms at the end of the trial. Combination therapy had the same safety profile in men besides MetS. Further randomized controlled trials are needed.",2
296,Management of patients who opt for radical prostatectomy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: an international accelerated consensus statement,"Objective:
        
      
      Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused delays in definitive treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Beyond the immediate delay a backlog for future patients is expected. The objective of this work is to develop guidance on criteria for prioritisation of surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve a low likelihood of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hazard if radical prostatectomy (RP) was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted an accelerated consensus process and systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n = 34) through an online meeting. The consensus process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. The Consensus opinion was defined as ≥80% agreement and this was used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and measures developed to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. Consensus was reached on prioritisation criteria of patients for surgery and management pathways for those who have delayed treatment. IPC measures to achieve a low likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 were coined as 'COVID-19 cold' sites.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Reconfiguring management pathways for patients with prostate cancer is recommended if significant delay (>3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable. The mapped pathways provide guidance for such patients. The IPC processes proposed provide a framework for providing RP within an environment with low COVID-19 risk during the outbreak or when the disease remains endemic. The broader concepts could be adapted to other indications beyond prostate cancer surgery.",3
297,Code Generation in Computational Neuroscience: A Review of Tools and Techniques,"Advances in experimental techniques and computational power allowing researchers to gather anatomical and electrophysiological data at unprecedented levels of detail have fostered the development of increasingly complex models in computational neuroscience. Large-scale, biophysically detailed cell models pose a particular set of computational challenges, and this has led to the development of a number of domain-specific simulators. At the other level of detail, the ever growing variety of point neuron models increases the implementation barrier even for those based on the relatively simple integrate-and-fire neuron model. Independently of the model complexity, all modeling methods crucially depend on an efficient and accurate transformation of mathematical model descriptions into efficiently executable code. Neuroscientists usually publish model descriptions in terms of the mathematical equations underlying them. However, actually simulating them requires they be translated into code. This can cause problems because errors may be introduced if this process is carried out by hand, and code written by neuroscientists may not be very computationally efficient. Furthermore, the translated code might be generated for different hardware platforms, operating system variants or even written in different languages and thus cannot easily be combined or even compared. Two main approaches to addressing this issues have been followed. The first is to limit users to a fixed set of optimized models, which limits flexibility. The second is to allow model definitions in a high level interpreted language, although this may limit performance. Recently, a third approach has become increasingly popular: using code generation to automatically translate high level descriptions into efficient low level code to combine the best of previous approaches. This approach also greatly enriches efforts to standardize simulator-independent model description languages. In the past few years, a number of code generation pipelines have been developed in the computational neuroscience community, which differ considerably in aim, scope and functionality. This article provides an overview of existing pipelines currently used within the community and contrasts their capabilities and the technologies and concepts behind them.",0
298,Quantitative Evaluation of Lobar Pulmonary Function of Emphysema Patients with Endobronchial Coils,"Background:
        
      
      Recent advances in bronchoscopic lung volume reduction offer new therapies for patients with emphysema and hyperinflation. Pulmonary lobe segmentation with quantification of lobar volumes and emphysema severity plays a pivotal role in treatment planning and post-interventional assessment. Computed tomography (CT)-derived lobar volumes could reflect more accurate regional changes in pulmonary function.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      The aim of our study is to validate the reliability of an in-house CT Lung Segmentation software (LungSeg; the Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London, UK) for lung lobar volume and emphysema quantification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 108 CT scans from subjects who participated in an endobronchial coil treatment trial were included. Lobar volume and emphysema quantification were performed using the LungSeg and Syngo CT Pulmo 3D package (Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Germany). The inter-user reliability of the LungSeg program was investigated. Correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses were used to quantify the inter-software variability. The agreement between CT volume analysis and plethysmography analysis was also examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The high intraclass correlation coefficients (mean ICC = 0.98) of the lobar volumes and emphysema indices measured by LungSeg suggest its excellent reproducibility. The LungSeg and Syngo program have good correlation (rho ≥0.94) and agreement for both lobar volume (median difference = 94 mL and LOAnp = 214.6 mL) and emphysema index (median difference ≤1.5% and LOAnp ≤2.03%) calculations. CT analysis provides a higher estimation of total lung capacity (TLCCT) than body plethysmography (TLCpleth), while there is a fair agreement on residual volume (RVCT) by LungSeg as compared with body plethysmography (RVpleth).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      CT-derived lobar volume and emphysema quantification using the LungSeg program is efficient and reliable in allowing lobar volume assessment. LungSeg has low inter-user variability and agrees better with plethysmography for COPD assessment in our study.",0

300,Surface flattening of the human left atrium and proof-of-concept clinical applications,"Surface flattening in medical imaging has seen widespread use in neurology and more recently in cardiology to describe the left ventricle using the bull's-eye plot. The method is particularly useful to standardize the display of functional information derived from medical imaging and catheter-based measurements. We hypothesized that a similar approach could be possible for the more complex shape of the left atrium (LA) and that the surface flattening could be useful for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We implemented an existing surface mesh parameterization approach to flatten and unfold 3D LA models. Mapping errors going from 2D to 3D and the inverse were investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetic data of regular shapes and computer tomography scans of an anthropomorphic phantom. Testing of the approach was carried out using data from 14 patients undergoing ablation treatment for AF. 3D LA meshes were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroanatomical mapping systems. These were unfolded using the developed approach and used to demonstrate proof-of-concept applications, such as the display of scar information, electrical information and catheter position. The work carried out shows that the unfolding of complex cardiac structures, such as the LA, is feasible and has several potential clinical uses for the management of patients with AF.",0
301,Accelerated magnetic resonance fingerprinting using soft-weighted key-hole (MRF-SOHO),"Object:
        
      
      To develop a novel approach for highly accelerated Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) acquisition.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The proposed method combines parallel imaging, soft-gating and key-hole approaches to highly accelerate MRF acquisition. Slowly varying flip angles (FA), commonly used during MRF acquisition, lead to a smooth change in the signal contrast of consecutive time-point images. This assumption enables sharing of high frequency data between different time-points, similar to what is done in some dynamic MR imaging methods such as key-hole. The proposed approach exploits this information using a SOft-weighted key-HOle (MRF-SOHO) reconstruction to achieve high acceleration factors and/or increased resolution without compromising image quality or increasing scan time. MRF-SOHO was validated on a standard T1/T2 phantom and in in-vivo brain acquisitions reconstructing T1, T2 and proton density parametric maps.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Accelerated MRF-SOHO using less data per time-point and less time-point images enabled a considerable reduction in scan time (up to 4.6x), while obtaining similar T1 and T2 accuracy and precision when compared to zero-filled MRF reconstruction. For the same number of spokes and time-points, the proposed method yielded an enhanced performance in quantifying parameters than the zero-filled MRF reconstruction, which was verified with 2, 1 and 0.7 (sub-millimetre) resolutions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The proposed MRF-SOHO enabled a 4.6x scan time reduction for an in-plane spatial resolution of 2x2 mm2 when compared to zero-filled MRF and enabled sub-millimetric (0.7x0.7 mm2) resolution MRF.",4
302,Diverticular disease is associated with an increased incidence rate of depression and anxiety disorders,"Background:
        
      
      Diverticular disease represents a gastrointestinal disorder of high prevalence in developed countries that often leads to psychological distress. Here, we aimed at evaluating a potential association between diverticular disease and depression or anxiety disorders in outpatients in Germany.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the Disease Analyzer database featuring data of over 8 million patients treated in German general practices, we identified 61.556 patients with diverticular disease (ICD-10: K57) who were 1:1 matched by age, sex, index year, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index to 61.556 patients without diverticular disease. The association between diverticular disease and depression or anxiety disorders was evaluated in Cox regression models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Within 5 years after the initial diagnosis of diverticular disease, 14.0% of patients with and 10.6% of individuals without diverticular disease were diagnosed with depression (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.29-1.39, p < 0.001). Similarly, the incidence of anxiety disorder was significantly higher in patients with diverticular disease (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.46-1.64, p < 0.001). Finally, the prescription rate for antidepressant drugs was significantly higher in diverticular disease patients compared to individuals without diverticular disease (9.4% vs. 6.1%, HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.49-1.62, p < 0.001). These associations were confirmed for different age groups and both sexes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our data provide evidence that diverticular disease is associated with an increased incidence of depression and anxiety disorders. Despite that fact that confounding factors such as deprivation and patient personality have to be taken into account, we suggest that patients with diverticular disease are regularly screened for symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.",0
303,"Data analytics and artificial intelligence in predicting length of stay, readmission, and mortality: a population-based study of surgical management of colorectal cancer","Data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have been used to predict patient outcomes after colorectal cancer surgery. A prospectively maintained colorectal cancer database was used, covering 4336 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery between 2003 and 2019. The 47 patient parameters included demographics, peri- and post-operative outcomes, surgical approaches, complications, and mortality. Data analytics were used to compare the importance of each variable and AI prediction models were built for length of stay (LOS), readmission, and mortality. Accuracies of at least 80% have been achieved. The significant predictors of LOS were age, ASA grade, operative time, presence or absence of a stoma, robotic or laparoscopic approach to surgery, and complications. The model with support vector regression (SVR) algorithms predicted the LOS with an accuracy of 83% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.69 days. The significant predictors of readmission were age, laparoscopic procedure, stoma performed, preoperative nodal (N) stage, operation time, operation mode, previous surgery type, LOS, and the specific procedure. A BI-LSTM model predicted readmission with 87.5% accuracy, 84% sensitivity, and 90% specificity. The significant predictors of mortality were age, ASA grade, BMI, the formation of a stoma, preoperative TNM staging, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, curative resection, and LOS. Classification predictive modelling predicted three different colorectal cancer mortality measures (overall mortality, and 31- and 91-days mortality) with 80-96% accuracy, 84-93% sensitivity, and 75-100% specificity. A model using all variables performed only slightly better than one that used just the most significant ones.",8
304,Social prediction modulates activity of macaque superior temporal cortex,"The ability to attribute thoughts to others, also called theory of mind (TOM), has been extensively studied in humans; however, its evolutionary origins have been challenged. Computationally, the basis of TOM has been interpreted within the predictive coding framework and associated with activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Here, we revealed, using a nonlinguistic task and functional magnetic resonance imaging, that activity in a region of the macaque middle superior temporal cortex was specifically modulated by the predictability of social situations. As in human TPJ, this region could be distinguished from other temporal regions involved in face processing. Our result suggests the existence of a precursor for the TOM ability in the last common ancestor of human and Old World monkeys.",4
305,A combination of second trimester oral metronidazole and no sexual intercourse during second and third trimester may reduce late miscarriage and premature delivery after fertility sparing radical trachelectomy,"Objectives:
        
      
      Women with a previous trachelectomy have an increased risk of premature delivery and second trimester miscarriage. In this study we aim to evaluate factors and regimes possibly affecting the risk for prematurity following fertility sparing robotic radical trachelectomy (RRT) in cervical cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective study of the reproductive outcome following RRT with a cervical cerclage performed at one of four academic centers between 2007 and 2019. Factors possibly related to premature delivery, such as postoperative non-pregnant cervical length, previous vaginal deliveries, preservation of the uterine arteries, and the use of a second trimester oral metronidazole/no sexual intercourse regime, were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      109 women remained for analyses after excluding recurrences before pregnancy (n = 8), secondary hysterectomy (n = 2), and women with less than six months follow up (n = 10). 74 pregnancies occurred in 52/71 women attempting to conceive, 56 of which developed past the first trimester. Two of 22 women (9%) who were prescribed an oral metronidazole regime (400 mg × 2 from gestational week 15 + 0 to 21 + 6 and abstaining from sexual intercourse for the duration of the pregnancy) had a premature delivery, compared with 13/31 (42%) where the regime was not applied (p = 0.009). The association remained after regression analyses including possible contributing factors as of above, none of which associated with prematurity at regression analyses (p = 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The observed four-fold reduction in premature delivery indicates that an oral metronidazole/no sexual intercourse regime may reduce second trimester miscarriage and premature deliveries following an RRT. No association was observed for other investigated factors.",0
306,Minimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (DIPLOMA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Recently, the first randomized trials comparing minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) with open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) for non-malignant and malignant disease showed a 2-day reduction in time to functional recovery after MIDP. However, for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), concerns have been raised regarding the oncologic safety (i.e., radical resection, lymph node retrieval, and survival) of MIDP, as compared to ODP. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial comparing MIDP and ODP in PDAC regarding oncological safety is warranted. We hypothesize that the microscopically radical resection (R0) rate is non-inferior for MIDP, as compared to ODP.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      DIPLOMA is an international randomized controlled, patient- and pathologist-blinded, non-inferiority trial performed in 38 pancreatic centers in Europe and the USA. A total of 258 patients with an indication for elective distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy because of proven or highly suspected PDAC of the pancreatic body or tail will be randomly allocated to MIDP (laparoscopic or robot-assisted) or ODP in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the microscopically radical resection margin (R0, distance tumor to pancreatic transection and posterior margin ≥ 1 mm), which is assessed using a standardized histopathology assessment protocol. The sample size is calculated with the following assumptions: 5% one-sided significance level (α), 80% power (1-β), expected R0 rate in the open group of 58%, expected R0 resection rate in the minimally invasive group of 67%, and a non-inferiority margin of 7%. Secondary outcomes include time to functional recovery, operative outcomes (e.g., blood loss, operative time, and conversion to open surgery), other histopathology findings (e.g., lymph node retrieval, perineural- and lymphovascular invasion), postoperative outcomes (e.g., clinically relevant complications, hospital stay, and administration of adjuvant treatment), time and site of disease recurrence, survival, quality of life, and costs. Follow-up will be performed at the outpatient clinic after 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postoperatively.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The DIPLOMA trial is designed to investigate the non-inferiority of MIDP versus ODP regarding the microscopically radical resection rate of PDAC in an international setting.

307,Renal transplantation through a modified non-muscle-cutting Pfannenstiel incision,"Aim:
        
      
      To assess the feasibility of performing a renal transplant operation through a modified non-muscle-cutting Pfannenstiel incision (MFI).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Renal transplantation with MFI was performed in 20 men with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25 and five women with a BMI of less than 27. The parameters assessed were incision length, operative time, postoperative pain score by visual analogue score, wound complication, graft-related complications, eGFR at 3 months, and surgical scar satisfaction score. The results were compared with a BMI-matched cohort of patients who had a conventional hockey stick incision. Statistical analyses were done by Chi-square test and Student's t test.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was a significant decrease in mean bed preparation time, mean time for closure, and mean incision length in patients with MFI. In MFI group, the mean surgical satisfaction score was significantly more. There was no significant difference between the groups on all other aspects.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the era of minimally invasive surgery, MFI technique could challenge the role of laparoscopic and robotic surgery in renal transplantation. Our study shows that the technique is successful in carefully selected patients with low BMI.",8
308,Tactile innervation densities across the whole body,"The skin is our largest sensory organ and innervated by afferent fibers carrying tactile information to the spinal cord and onto the brain. The density with which different classes of tactile afferents innervate the skin is not constant but varies considerably across different body regions. However, precise estimates of innervation density are only available for some body parts, such as the hands, and estimates of the total number of tactile afferent fibers are inconsistent and incomplete. Here we reconcile different estimates and provide plausible ranges and best estimates for the number of different tactile fiber types innervating different regions of the skin, using evidence from dorsal root fiber counts, microneurography, histology, and psychophysics. We estimate that the skin across the whole body of young adults is innervated by ∼230,000 tactile afferent fibers (plausible range: 200,000-270,000), with a subsequent decrement of 5-8% every decade due to aging. Fifteen percent of fibers innervate the palmar skin of both hands and 19% the region surrounding the face and lips. Slowly and fast-adapting fibers are split roughly evenly, but this breakdown varies with skin region. Innervation density correlates well with psychophysical spatial acuity across different body regions, and, additionally, on hairy skin, with hair follicle density. Innervation density is also weakly correlated with the size of the cortical somatotopic representation but cannot fully account for the magnification of the hands and the face.",6
309,Tracking slow modulations in synaptic gain using dynamic causal modelling: validation in epilepsy,"In this work we propose a proof of principle that dynamic causal modelling can identify plausible mechanisms at the synaptic level underlying brain state changes over a timescale of seconds. As a benchmark example for validation we used intracranial electroencephalographic signals in a human subject. These data were used to infer the (effective connectivity) architecture of synaptic connections among neural populations assumed to generate seizure activity. Dynamic causal modelling allowed us to quantify empirical changes in spectral activity in terms of a trajectory in parameter space - identifying key synaptic parameters or connections that cause observed signals. Using recordings from three seizures in one patient, we considered a network of two sources (within and just outside the putative ictal zone). Bayesian model selection was used to identify the intrinsic (within-source) and extrinsic (between-source) connectivity. Having established the underlying architecture, we were able to track the evolution of key connectivity parameters (e.g., inhibitory connections to superficial pyramidal cells) and test specific hypotheses about the synaptic mechanisms involved in ictogenesis. Our key finding was that intrinsic synaptic changes were sufficient to explain seizure onset, where these changes showed dissociable time courses over several seconds. Crucially, these changes spoke to an increase in the sensitivity of principal cells to intrinsic inhibitory afferents and a transient loss of excitatory-inhibitory balance.",4
310,Outcomes of Tumour Control from Primary Treatment of Hypopharyngeal Cancer,"Hypopharynx cancer continues to pose a clinically challenging head and neck subsite, driven not only by the unique set of patient, anatomic and disease factors but also by the paucity of robust clinical data to guide clinical decision making. The standard of care of radical surgery (pharyngolaryngectomy) in combination with postoperative radiotherapy was the previously accepted norm in the setting of advanced hypopharynx cancer, but this was often at the expense of significant morbidity. In the absence of survival benefit for advanced staged disease with radical surgical approaches, over the last 2 decades, the philosophy of quality of life in survivors has driven the agenda for new therapeutic approaches. The adoption of functional larynx preservation strategies has seen a paradigm shift in the treatment of this subsite since the 1990s with the advent of chemoradiation and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, thereby introducing a reducing trend for radical surgery. However, radical surgery (pharyngolaryngectomy) has a role in the non-functioning larynx (either pre- or post-treatment), in advanced volume disease and the more technically challenging salvage setting because of residual or recurrent disease. In earlier stage disease, transoral laser microsurgery and robotic surgery have shown good oncological benefits. Crucially, determining appropriate personalised treatment decisions in this challenging cohort of patients requires discussion within a multidisciplinary team framework.",0

      Literature was searched for terms 'Müllerian' 'duct' 'remnants' and 'laparoscopy'. Primary end points were age at surgery, laparoscopic technique, intraoperative complications and postoperative morbidity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The search revealed 10 articles (2003-2014) and included 23 patients with mean age of 1.5 years (0.5-18) at surgery. All patients were 46XY, n = 1 normal male karyotype with two cell lines. Explorative laparoscopy was performed in n = 2 and surgical management in n = 21. The 5-port technique was used in n = 10, 3-port in n = 9 and robot-assisted laparoscopic approach in n = 1 (n = 1 technique not described). Complete MDRs removal in n = 9, complete dissection and MDRs neck ligation with endoscopic loops in n = 11 and n = 1 uterus and cervix were split in the midline. After MDRs removal, there were n = 2 bilateral orchidopexy, n = 3 unilateral orchidopexy, n = 1 Fowler-Stephens stage-I and n = 1 orchiectomy. Mean operative time was 193 min (120-334), and there were no intraoperative complications. Mean follow-up was 20.5 months (3-54) and morbidity included 1 prostatic diverticula. There were 13 associations with hypospadias, of which 3 had mixed gonads and 3 bilateral cryptorchidism. Other associations were unilateral cryptorchidism and incarcerated inguinal hernia n = 1, right renal agenesis and left hydronephrosis n = 1 and n = 2 with transverse testicular ectopy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This MDRs analysis suggests that the laparoscopic approach is an effective and safe method of treatment as no intraoperative complication has reported, and there is low morbidity in the long-term follow-up.",1
312,Hepatic function assessment to predict post-hepatectomy liver failure: what can we trust? A systematic review,"Post hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) could occur even though an adequate liver volume is preserved. Liver function is not strictly related to the volume and the necessity to pre-operatively predict the future liver remnant (FLR) function is emerging, together with the wide spreading of techniques, aiming to optimize the FLR. The aim of this study was to systematically review all the available tests, to pre-operatively assess the liver function and to estimate the risk of PHLF. A systematic literature research of Medline, Embase, Scopus was performed in accordance to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to identify all the studies available for pre-operative liver function tests to assess the risk of PHLF and/or complications. From the 1122 references retrieved, 79 were included in the review. Dynamic functional tests, such as indocyanine green test (ICG), could evaluate only global liver function, with no definition of functional capacity of the remnant. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with liver-specific contrast agents enables both liver function and volume evaluation; the absence of ionizing radiation showed a better patient's compliance. Nuclear imaging studies as hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) present the unique ability to allow a precise evaluation of the segmental liver function of the remnant liver. Liver volume could overestimate liver function. Several liver function tests are available to evaluate the risk of PHLF in the pre-operative setting. However, no single test alone could accurately predict PHLF. Pre-operative combination between a dynamic quantitative test, such as ICG, with MRI or HBS, should enable a more complete functional evaluation. Functional tests to predict PHLF should be chosen according to patient's characteristics, disease, and center experience.",2
313,Learned optical flow for intra-operative tracking of the retinal fundus,"Purpose:
        
      
      Sustained delivery of regenerative retinal therapies by robotic systems requires intra-operative tracking of the retinal fundus. We propose a supervised deep convolutional neural network to densely predict semantic segmentation and optical flow of the retina as mutually supportive tasks, implicitly inpainting retinal flow information missing due to occlusion by surgical tools.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      As manual annotation of optical flow is infeasible, we propose a flexible algorithm for generation of large synthetic training datasets on the basis of given intra-operative retinal images. We evaluate optical flow estimation by tracking a grid and sparsely annotated ground truth points on a benchmark of challenging real intra-operative clips obtained from an extensive internally acquired dataset encompassing representative vitreoretinal surgical cases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The U-Net-based network trained on the synthetic dataset is shown to generalise well to the benchmark of real surgical videos. When used to track retinal points of interest, our flow estimation outperforms variational baseline methods on clips containing tool motions which occlude the points of interest, as is routinely observed in intra-operatively recorded surgery videos.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results indicate that complex synthetic training datasets can be used to specifically guide optical flow estimation. Our proposed algorithm therefore lays the foundation for a robust system which can assist with intra-operative tracking of moving surgical targets even when occluded.",3
314,Roles of universal three-dimensional image analysis devices that assist surgical operations,"The circumstances surrounding medical image analysis have undergone rapid evolution. In such a situation, it can be said that ""imaging"" obtained through medical imaging modality and the ""analysis"" that we employ have become amalgamated. Recently, we feel the distance between ""imaging"" and ""analysis"" has become closer regarding the imaging analysis of any organ system, as if both terms mentioned above have become integrated. The history of medical image analysis started with the appearance of the computer. The invention of multi-planar reconstruction (MPR) used in the helical scan had a significant impact and became the basis for recent image analysis. Subsequently, curbed MPR (CPR) and other methods were developed, and the 3D diagnostic imaging and image analysis of the human body have started on a full scale. Volume rendering: the development of a new rendering algorithm and the significant improvement of memory and CPUs contributed to the development of ""volume rendering,"" which allows 3D views with retained internal information. A new value was created by this development; computed tomography (CT) images that used to be for ""diagnosis"" before that time have become ""applicable to treatment."" In the past, before the development of volume rendering, a clinician had to mentally reconstruct an image reconfigured for diagnosis into a 3D image, but these developments have allowed the depiction of a 3D image on a monitor. Current technology: Currently, in Japan, the estimation of the liver volume and the perfusion area of the portal vein and hepatic vein are vigorously being adopted during preoperative planning for hepatectomy. Such a circumstance seems to be brought by the substantial improvement of said basic techniques and by upgrading the user interface, allowing doctors easy manipulation by themselves. The following describes the specific techniques. Future of post-processing technology: It is expected, in terms of the role of image analysis, for better or worse, that computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) will develop to a highly advanced level in every diagnostic field. Further, it is also expected in the treatment field that a technique coordinating various devices will be strongly required as a surgery navigator. Actually, surgery using an image navigator is being widely studied, and coordination with hardware, including robots, will also be developed.",0
315,Copresence With Virtual Humans in Mixed Reality: The Impact of Contextual Responsiveness on Social Perceptions,"Virtual humans (VHs)-automated, three-dimensional agents-can serve as realistic embodiments for social interactions with human users. Extant literature suggests that a user's cognitive and affective responses toward a VH depend on the extent to which the interaction elicits a sense of copresence, or the subjective ""sense of being together."" Furthermore, prior research has linked copresence to important social outcomes (e.g., likeability and trust), emphasizing the need to understand which factors contribute to this psychological state. Although there is some understanding of the determinants of copresence in virtual reality (VR) (cf. Oh et al., 2018), it is less known what determines copresence in mixed reality (MR), a modality wherein VHs have unique access to social cues in a ""real-world"" setting. In the current study, we examined the extent to which a VH's responsiveness to events occurring in the user's physical environment increased a sense of copresence and heightened affective connections to the VH. Participants (N = 65) engaged in two collaborative tasks with a (nonspeaking) VH using an MR headset. In the first task, no event in the participant's physical environment would occur, which served as the control condition. In the second task, an event in the participants' physical environment occurred, to which the VH either responded or ignored depending on the experimental condition. Copresence and interpersonal evaluations of the VHs were measured after each collaborative task via self-reported measures. Results show that when the VH responded to the physical event, participants experienced a significant stronger sense of copresence than when the VH did not respond. However, responsiveness did not elicit more positive evaluations toward the VH (likeability and emotional connectedness). This study is an integral first step in establishing how and when affective and cognitive components of evaluations during social interactions diverge. Importantly, the findings suggest that feeling copresence with VH in MR is partially determined by the VHs' response to events in the actual physical environment shared by both interactants.",4
316,An International Survey on the Use of Thromboprophylaxis in Urological Surgery,"Background:
        
      
      The use of perioperative thromboprophylaxis in urological surgery is common but not standardized.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To characterize international practice variation in thromboprophylaxis use in urological surgery.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      We conducted a scenario-based survey addressing the use of mechanical and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in urological cancer procedures (radical cystectomy [RC], radical prostatectomy [RP], and radical nephrectomy [RN]) among practicing urologists in Canada, Finland, and Japan. The survey presented patient profiles reflecting a spectrum of risk for venous thromboembolism; the respondents described their clinical practice.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      The proportion of respondents who routinely used (1) mechanical, (2) pharmacological, and (3) extended pharmacological prophylaxis was stratified by procedure. A logistic regression identified characteristics associated with thromboprophylaxis use.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Of 1051 urologists contacted, 570 (54%) participated in the survey. Japanese urologists were less likely to prescribe pharmacological prophylaxis than Canadian or Finnish urologists (p < 0.001 for all procedures). Canadian and Finnish urologists exhibited large variation for extended pharmacological prophylaxis for RP and RN. Finnish urologists were most likely to prescribe extended prophylaxis versus Canadian and Japanese urologists (RC 98%, 84%, and 26%; Open RP 25%, 8%, and 3%; robotic RP 11%, 9%, and 0%; and RN 43%, 7%, and 1%, respectively; p < 0.001 for each procedure). Less variation was found regarding the prescription of mechanical prophylaxis, which was most commonly used until ambulation or discharge. The length of hospital stay was longer in Japan and may bias estimates of extended prophylaxis in Japan.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found large variation in clinical practice regarding pharmacological thromboprophylaxis within and between countries. Knowledge translation of evidence-based guidelines may reduce problematic international variation in practice.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Use of medications to decrease blood clots after urological cancer surgery differs within and between countries. Closer adherence to urology guidelines addressing the prevention of blood clots may decrease this variation and improve patient outcomes.",3
317,Telemedicine and Telehealth in Urology-What Do the 'Patients' Think About It?,"Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare to patients who are not in the same location as the physician. The practice of telemedicine has a large number of advantages, including cost savings, low chances of nosocomial infection, and fewer hospital visits. Teleclinics have been reported to be successful in the post-surgery and post-cancer therapy follow-up, and in offering consulting services for urolithiasis patients. This review focuses on identifying the outcomes of the recent studies related to the usage of video consulting in urology centers for hematuria referrals and follow-up appointments for a variety of illnesses, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), kidney stone disease (KSD), and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and found that they are highly acceptable and satisfied. Certain medical disorders can cause embarrassment, social exclusion, and also poor self-esteem, all of which can negatively impair health-related quality-of-life. Telemedicine has proven beneficial in such patients and is a reliable, cost-effective patient-care tool, and it has been successfully implemented in various healthcare settings and specialties.",0
318,Reimbursement practices for use of digital devices in atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias: a European Heart Rhythm Association survey,"Since digital devices are increasingly used in cardiology for assessing cardiac rhythm and detecting arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), our aim was to evaluate the expectations and opinions of healthcare professionals in Europe on reimbursement policies for the use of digital devices (including wearables) in AF and other arrhythmias. An anonymous survey was proposed through announcements on the European Heart Rhythm Association website, social media channels, and mail newsletter. Two hundred and seventeen healthcare professionals participated in the survey: 32.7%, reported regular use of digital devices, 45.2% reported that they sometimes use these tools, 18.6% that they do not use but would like to. Only a minority (3.5%) reported a lack of trust in digital devices. The survey highlighted a general propensity to provide medical consultation for suspected AF or other arrhythmias detected by a consumer-initiated use of digital devices, even if time constraints and reimbursement availability emerged as important elements. More than 85% of respondents agreed that reimbursement should be applied for clinical use of digital devices, also in different settings such as post-stroke, post-cardioversion, post-ablation, and in patients with palpitations or syncope. Finally, 73.6% of respondents confirmed a lack of reimbursement fees in their country for physicians' consultations (tracings interpretation) related to digital devices. Digital devices, including wearables, are increasingly and widely used for assessing cardiac rhythm and detecting AF, but a definition of reimbursement policies for physicians' consultations is needed.",0
319,A Systematic Review of Focal Ablative Therapy for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer in Comparison with Standard Management Options: Limitations of the Available Evidence and Recommendations for Clinical Practice and Further Research,"Context:
        
      
      The clinical effectiveness of focal therapy (FT) for localised prostate cancer (PCa) remains controversial.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To analyse the evidence base for primary FT for localised PCa via a systematic review (SR) to formulate clinical practice recommendations.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A protocol-driven, PRISMA-adhering SR comparing primary FT (sub-total, focal, hemi-gland, or partial ablation) versus standard options (active surveillance [AS], radical prostatectomy [RP], or external beam radiotherapy [EBRT]) was undertaken. Only comparative studies with ≥50 patients per arm were included. Primary outcomes included oncological, functional, and quality-of-life outcomes. Risk of bias (RoB) and confounding assessments were undertaken. Eligible SRs were reviewed and appraised (AMSTAR) and ongoing prospective comparative studies were summarised.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      Out of 1119 articles identified, four primary studies (1 randomised controlled trial [RCT] and 3 retrospective studies) recruiting 3961 patients and ten eligible SRs were identified. Only qualitative synthesis was possible owing to clinical heterogeneity. Overall, RoB and confounding were moderate to high. An RCT comparing vascular-targeted focal photodynamic therapy (PDT) with AS found a significantly lower rate of treatment failure at 2 yr with PDT. There were no differences in functional outcomes, although PDT was associated with worse transient adverse events. However, the external validity of the study was contentious. A retrospective study comparing focal HIFU with robotic RP found no significant differences in treatment failure at 3 yr, with focal HIFU having better continence and erectile function recovery. Two retrospective cohort studies using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data compared focal laser ablation (FLA) against RP and EBRT, reporting significantly worse oncological outcomes for FLA. The overall data quality and applicability of the primary studies were limited because of clinical heterogeneity, RoB and confounding, lack of long-term data, inappropriate outcome measures, and poor external validity. Virtually all the SRs identified concluded that there was insufficient high-certainty evidence to make definitive conclusions regarding the clinical effectiveness of FT, with the majority of SRs judged to have a low or critically low confidence rating. Eight ongoing prospective comparative studies were identified. Ways of improving the evidence base are discussed.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The certainty of the evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of FT as a primary treatment for localised PCa was low, with significant uncertainties. Until higher-certainty evidence emerges from robust prospective comparative studies measuring clinically meaningful outcomes at long-term time points, FT should ideally be performed within clinical trials or well-designed prospective cohort studies.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We examined the literature to determine the effectiveness of prostate-targeted treatment compared with standard treatments for untreated localised prostate cancer. There was no strong evidence showing that focal treatment compares favourably with standard treatments; consequently, focal treatment is not recommended for routine standard practice.",2
320,Conservative and medical treatments of non-sickle cell disease-related ischemic priapism: a systematic review by the EAU Sexual and Reproductive Health Panel,"Conservative and medical treatments are considered the first step in ischemic priapism (IP) management, although there is no clear evidence regarding their efficacy. We conducted a systematic review on behalf of the EAU Guidelines panel on Sexual and Reproductive health to analyse the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of conservative and medical treatment for non-sickle cell disease-related IP. Databases searched for relevant literature investigating efficacy and safety of conservative measures and medical treatment for IP included Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Libraries and clinicaltrial.gov published up to September 2021. Overall, 41 retrospective, 3 prospective single-arm studies and 3 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Intracavernous injection with sympathomimetic (ICIs) agents were the most frequently utilized treatment with efficacy ranging from 0 to 100% of cases. The combination of ICIs with corporeal aspiration with or without irrigation with saline was successful in 70 to 100% of cases. Oral treatment with β2 receptor agonist (e.g., terbutaline) showed mild to moderate efficacy. Conservative methods including ice pack, exercise, cold enema and ejaculation depicted lower effectiveness in resolving priapism (1-55%). Longer time interval from the onset to the resolution of IP was associated with higher rate of erectile dysfunction at follow-up (30-70%), especially after 24 h.",2
321,EHRA White Paper: knowledge gaps in arrhythmia management-status 2019,"Clinicians accept that there are many unknowns when we make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Acceptance of uncertainty is essential for the pursuit of the profession: bedside decisions must often be made on the basis of incomplete evidence. Over the years, physicians sometimes even do not realize anymore which the fundamental gaps in our knowledge are. As clinical scientists, however, we have to halt and consider what we do not know yet, and how we can move forward addressing those unknowns. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) believes that scanning the field of arrhythmia / cardiac electrophysiology to identify knowledge gaps which are not yet the subject of organized research, should be undertaken on a regular basis. Such a review (White Paper) should concentrate on research which is feasible, realistic, and clinically relevant, and should not deal with futuristic aspirations. It fits with the EHRA mission that these White Papers should be shared on a global basis in order to foster collaborative and needed research which will ultimately lead to better care for our patients. The present EHRA White Paper summarizes knowledge gaps in the management of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia/sudden death and heart failure.",0
322,Polyfunctionalised Nanoparticles Bearing Robust Gadolinium Surface Units for High Relaxivity Performance in MRI,"The first example of an octadentate gadolinium unit based on DO3A (hydration number q=1) with a dithiocarbamate tether has been designed and attached to the surface of gold nanoparticles (around 4.4 nm in diameter). In addition to the superior robustness of this attachment, the restricted rotation of the Gd complex on the nanoparticle surface leads to a dramatic increase in relaxivity (r1 ) from 4.0 mm-1 s-1 in unbound form to 34.3 mm-1 s-1 (at 10 MHz, 37 °C) and 22±2 mm-1 s-1 (at 63.87 MHz, 25 °C) when immobilised on the surface. The one-pot synthetic route provides a straightforward and versatile way of preparing a range of multifunctional gold nanoparticles. The incorporation of additional surface units for biocompatibility (PEG and thioglucose units) and targeting (folic acid) leads to little detrimental effect on the high relaxivity observed for these non-toxic multifunctional materials. In addition to the passive targeting attributed to gold nanoparticles, the inclusion of a unit capable of targeting the folate receptors overexpressed by cancer cells, such as HeLa cells, illustrates the potential of these assemblies.",0
323,Role of Quantitative Computed Tomographic Scan Analysis in Lung Volume Reduction for Emphysema,"Recent advances in bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) offer new therapeutic alternatives for patients with emphysema and hyperinflation. Endobronchial valves and coils are 2 potential BLVR techniques which have been shown to improve pulmonary function and the quality of life in patients with emphysema. Current patient selection for LVR procedures relies on 3 main inclusion criteria: low attenuation area (in %), also known as emphysema score, heterogeneity score, and fissure integrity score. Volumetric analysis in combination with densitometric analysis of the affected lung lobe or segment with quantitative CT to determine emphysema severity play an important role in treatment planning and post-operative assessment. Due to the variations in lung anatomy, manual corrections are often required to ensure successful and accurate lobe segmentation for pathological and post-treatment CT scan analysis. The advanced development and utilisation of quantitative CT do not simply represent regional changes in pulmonary function but aids in analysis for better patient selection with severe emphysema who are most likely to benefit from BLVR.",0
324,Variation in surgical treatment advice for women with stress urinary incontinence: a study using clinical case vignettes,"Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to determine how recommendations of gynaecologists on surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were influenced by patient characteristics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two hundred forty-five gynaecologists in the UK fully responded to an online questionnaire including 18 vignettes describing 7 clinical characteristics of women with SUI (age, body mass index, SUI type, previous SUI surgery, frequency of leakage, bother, physical status). The gynaecologists scored recommendations for surgery ranging from 1 'certainly not' to 5 'certainly yes'. Mean scores were used to calculate the relative impact ('weight') of each clinical characteristic. Latent class analysis was used to distinguish groups of gynaecologists with a particular practice style because they responded to the patient characteristics captured in the case vignettes in a similar way.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The gynaecologists' overall average recommendation score was 2.9 (interquartile range 2 to 4). All patient characteristics significantly influenced the recommendation scores (p always < 0.001) but their impact was relatively small. SUI type was most important (weight 23%), followed by previous SUI surgery (weight 21%). Latent class analysis identified five groups of gynaecologists with practice styles that differed mainly with respect to their mean recommendation score, ranging from 1.3 to 4.0.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surgical treatment advice in response to case vignettes was only minimally influenced by patient characteristics. There were five groups of gynaecologists whose inclination to recommend surgical treatment varied. This suggests that there is lack of consensus on the role of surgery as a treatment for SUI. A considerable number of gynaecologists were reluctant to recommend surgery.",3
325,Exploring variability in basal ganglia connectivity with functional MRI in healthy aging,"Changes in functional connectivity (FC) measured using resting state fMRI within the basal ganglia network (BGN) have been observed in pathologies with altered neurotransmitter systems and conditions involving motor control and dopaminergic processes. However, less is known about non-disease factors affecting FC in the BGN. The aim of this study was to examine associations of FC within the BGN with dopaminergic processes in healthy older adults. We explored the relationship between FC in the BGN and variables related to demographics, impulsive behavior, self-paced tasks, mood, and motor correlates in 486 participants in the Whitehall-II imaging sub-study using both region-of-interest- and voxel-based approaches. Age was the only correlate of FC in the BGN that was consistently significant with both analyses. The observed adverse effect of aging on FC may relate to alterations of the dopaminergic system, but no unique dopamine-related function seemed to have a link with FC beyond those detectable in and linearly correlated with healthy aging.",6
326,Transfer of Skills From Simulation Lab to Surgical Services: Impact of a Decade Long Laparoscopic Urology Surgical Course,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the impact of decade-long dedicated laparoscopic urology surgical skills course on the successful implementation of surgical services by the participants.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective database was maintained for all the participants in urological laparoscopic courses run by a single dedicated unit between January 2016 and December 2016. Data on various variables were collected using a follow-up validated questionnaire exploring speciality of clinical practice, challenges and need for additional training to establish clinical services, improvement in quality and frequency of laparoscopic courses. A subset of participants reported data of their outcomes in a national database available publically.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred sixty one delegates were drawn from 18 countries attended laparoscopic skills courses during the study period of 10 years. Data were available for 154 (95.65%) participants. There were only 20 (20/154; 12.9%) responses to online website questionnaires despite 3 reminders. Further, follow-up through websites/telephonic contact/organizational contacts improved the response rate to 93% (143/154). Of the participants, 95% (135/143) felt that these courses should be continued, and they agreed to recommend them to their trainees in the future. More than 50% (81/143; 56.6%) of the participants performed laparoscopic/robotic surgery at various centers. Sixty two (62/143; 43.3%) did not pursue laparoscopic surgery as a career choice. Fifty six (56/81; 69%) participants were established laparoscopic surgeons were from the UK, and of them, 30 (30/56; 53.57%: 30/81; 37.04%) were established surgeons that contributed to publishing their results through professional organizations with the outcomes of all of these within normal ranges of their peers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A dedicated laparoscopic urological surgery course run over a decade had a significant impact on the skills of participants, and most participants were able to establish clinical practice catering to a large proportion of the UK population as well as a few centers internationally.",3
327,Development and clinical validation of an automated cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay for detecting Clostridioides difficile toxins in clinically relevant stools samples,"Objectives:
        
      
      To improve the diagnostic accuracy of Clostridioides difficile infection, current U.S. and E.U. guidelines recommend multistep testing that detects the presence of C. difficile and toxin in clinically relevant stool samples to confirm active disease. An accepted gold standard to detect C. difficile toxins is the cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA). Although highly sensitive, the traditional CCNA has limitations. One such limitation is the subjective interpretation of an analyst to recognize cytopathic effects in cultured cells exposed to a fecal sample containing toxin. To overcome this limitation, an automated CCNA was developed that replaces most human pipetting steps with robotics and incorporates CellTiterGlo® for a semi-quantitative, non-subjective measure of cell viability instead of microscopy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To determine sample positivity and control for non-specific cytopathic effects, two thresholds were defined and validated by evaluating the sample with/without antitoxin antisera (sample-antitoxin/sample + antitoxin): 1) a >70% cell viability threshold was validated with samples containing anti-toxin, and 2) a >1.2-fold difference cut-off where sample results above the cut-off are considered positive.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Assay validation demonstrated excellent accuracy, precision, and sample linearity with an LOD of 126.9 pg/mL toxin-B in stool. The positivity cut-offs were clinically validated by comparing 322 diarrheal stool sample results with those run in a predicate, microscopic readout-based CCNA. The automated CCNA demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared with the predicate CCNA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, the automated CCNA provides a specific, sensitive, and reproducible tool to support determination of CDI epidemiology or the efficacy of interventions such as vaccines.",0
328,Use of Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis during pelvic surgery in a uterine transplantation model,"Aim:
        
      
      Uterine transplantation (UTx) is proposed for treatment of uterine factor infertility. Our aim was to assess whether Endoscopic Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (eLASCA) could evaluate pelvic blood flow at anastomotic sites required for sheep and rabbit UTx.
    


          Results/methodology:
        
      
      eLASCA detected blood flow in rabbit UTx #7 and #9. In sheep UTx #2, #3 and #5, the results allowed us to conclude that blood flow was present in the uterine graft following transplantation; and post-UTx, the animal had heart and respiratory rates, and oxygen saturation compatible with a normal hemodynamic status.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These preliminary results establish the potential of Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis as noncontact and real-time tool for observation of spatially-resolved blood flow from which other parameters can be derived.",0
329,Capsular Mechanics After Periacetabular Osteotomy for Hip Dysplasia,"Background:
        
      
      Hip dysplasia is characterized by insufficient acetabular coverage around the femoral head, which leads to instability, pain, and injury. Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) aims to restore acetabular coverage and function, but its effects on capsular mechanics and joint stability are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of PAO on capsular mechanics and joint range of motion in dysplastic hips.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve cadaveric dysplastic hips (denuded to bone and capsule) were mounted onto a robotic tester and tested in multiple positions: (1) full extension, (2) neutral 0°, (3) flexion of 30°, (4) flexion of 60°, and (5) flexion of 90°. In each position, the hips underwent internal and external rotation, abduction, and adduction using 5 Nm of torque. Each hip then underwent PAO to reorient the acetabular fragment, preserving the capsular ligaments, and was retested.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The PAO reduced internal rotation in flexion of 90° (∆IR = -5°; p = 0.003), and increased external rotation in flexion of 60° (∆ER = +7°; p = 0.001) and flexion of 90° (∆ER = +11°; p = 0.001). The PAO also reduced abduction in extension (∆ABD = -10°; p = 0.002), neutral 0° (∆ABD = -7°; p = 0.001), and flexion of 30° (∆ABD = -8°; p = 0.001), but increased adduction in neutral 0° (∆ADD = +9°; p = 0.001), flexion of 30° (∆ADD = +11°; p = 0.002), and flexion of 60° (∆ADD = +11°; p = 0.003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PAO caused reductions in hip abduction and internal rotation but greater increases in hip adduction and external rotation. The osseous acetabular structure and capsule both play a role in the balance between joint mobility and stability after PAO.",3
330,Protocol for a feasibility study of a cohort embedded randomised controlled trial comparing NE phron S paring T reatment (NEST) for small renal masses,"Introduction:
        
      
      Small renal masses (SRMs; ≤4 cm) account for two-thirds of new diagnoses of kidney cancer, the majority of which are incidental findings. The natural history of the SRM seems largely indolent. There is an increasing concern regarding surgical overtreatment and the associated health burden in terms of morbidity and economy. Observational data support the safety and efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation but there is an unmet need for high-quality evidence on non-surgical management options and a head-to-head comparison with standard of care is lacking. Historical interventional trial recruitment difficulties demand novel study conduct approaches. We aim to assess if a novel trial design, the cohort embedded randomised controlled trial (RCT), will enable carrying out such a comparison.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      Single-centre prospective cohort study of adults diagnosed with SRM (n=200) with an open label embedded interventional RCT comparing nephron sparing interventions. Cohort participants will be managed at patient and clinicians' discretion and agree with longitudinal clinical data and biological sample collection, with invitation for trial interventions and participation in comparator control groups. Cohort participants with biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma eligible for both percutaneous cryoablation and partial nephrectomy will be randomly selected (1:1) and invited to consider percutaneous cryoablation (n=25). The comparator group will be robotic partial nephrectomy (n=25). The primary outcome of this feasibility study is participant recruitment. Qualitative research techniques will assess barriers and recruitment improvement opportunities. Secondary outcomes are participant trial retention, health-related quality of life, treatment complications, blood transfusion rate, intensive care unit admission and renal replacement requirement rates, length of hospital stay, time to return to pre-treatment activities, number of work days lost, and health technologies costs.

331,A comprehensive update on urinary tract lithiasis management,"In the past decade, the field of urology has been one of the most rapidly progressing in applied technological advancements at the level of both medical diagnostics and treatment. The introduction of modern robotic laparoscopy has changed the face of minimally invasive surgery. For endourology specialists, stone surgery continues to be in the forefront of daily practice and innovations and new technologies are constantly being developed, aiming towards ever higher stone free rates and earlier recovery for the patient. But, is there a price? Indeed, in addition to advances in conservative treatment and prevention, modern endourology and stone disease management in particular enjoys a large variety of sophisticated new equipment and disposables, used either alone or in combination, developed from various companies at considerable cost. It is more than often that even expert professionals are not totally familiar with the whole range of treatment options and devices that are available in the market, as they commonly bear different names despite being used for the same purpose. Furthermore, a question of integrity might arise when using newly developed equipment directly in the operating theatre, with respect to the efficacy of the device as well as the learning curve required by the operator. In this review, we shall outline the latest advances in interventional lithotripsy technology and also demonstrate the most effective ways to use each particular modality efficiently and safely, with respect to the latest published guidelines and evidence-based recommendations.",0
332,Energy-Structure-Function Maps: Cartography for Materials Discovery,"Some of the most successful approaches to structural design in materials chemistry have exploited strong directional bonds, whose geometric reliability lends predictability to solid-state assembly. For example, metal-organic frameworks are an important design platform in materials chemistry. By contrast, the structure of molecular crystals is defined by a balance of weaker intermolecular forces, and small changes to the molecular building blocks can lead to large changes in crystal packing. Hence, empirical rules are inherently less reliable for engineering the structures of molecular solids. Energy-structure-function (ESF) maps are a new approach for the discovery of functional organic crystals. These maps fuse crystal-structure prediction with the computation of physical properties to allow researchers to choose the most promising molecule for a given application, prior to its synthesis. ESF maps were used recently to discover a highly porous molecular crystal that has a high methane deliverable capacity and the lowest density molecular crystal reported to date (r = 0.41 g cm-3 , SABET = 3425 m2 g-1 ). Progress in this field is reviewed, with emphasis on the future opportunities and challenges for a design strategy based on computed ESF maps.",0
333,The present and future of deep learning in radiology,"The advent of Deep Learning (DL) is poised to dramatically change the delivery of healthcare in the near future. Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs. A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging.",1
334,Reward and punishment enhance motor adaptation in stroke,"Background and objective:
        
      
      The effects of motor learning, such as motor adaptation, in stroke rehabilitation are often transient, thus mandating approaches that enhance the amount of learning and retention. Previously, we showed in young individuals that reward and punishment feedback have dissociable effects on motor adaptation, with punishment improving adaptation and reward enhancing retention. If these findings were able to generalise to patients with stroke, they would provide a way to optimise motor learning in these patients. Therefore, we tested this in 45 patients with chronic stroke allocated in three groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients performed reaching movements with their paretic arm with a robotic manipulandum. After training (day 1), day 2 involved adaptation to a novel force field. During the adaptation phase, patients received performance-based feedback according to the group they were allocated: reward, punishment or no feedback (neutral). On day 3, patients readapted to the force field but all groups now received neutral feedback.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients adapted, with reward and punishment groups displaying greater adaptation and readaptation than the neutral group, irrespective of demographic, cognitive or functional differences. Remarkably, the reward and punishment groups adapted to similar degree as healthy controls. Finally, the reward group showed greater retention.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study provides, for the first time, evidence that reward and punishment can enhance motor adaptation in patients with stroke. Further research on reinforcement-based motor learning regimes is warranted to translate these promising results into clinical practice and improve motor rehabilitation outcomes in patients with stroke.",4
335,Laryngeal cancer: United Kingdom National Multidisciplinary guidelines,"This is the official guideline endorsed by the specialty associations involved in the care of head and neck cancer patients in the UK. Significantly new data have been published on laryngeal cancer management since the last edition of the guidelines. This paper discusses the evidence base pertaining to the management of laryngeal cancer and provides updated recommendations on management for this group of patients receiving cancer care. Recommendations • Radiotherapy (RT) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) are accepted treatment options for T1a-T2a glottic carcinoma. (R) • Open partial surgery may have a role in the management of selected tumours. (R) • Radiotherapy, TLM and transoral robotic surgery are reasonable treatment options for T1-T2 supraglottic carcinoma. (R) • Supraglottic laryngectomy may have a role in the management of selected tumours. (R) • Most patients with T2b-T3 glottic cancers are suitable for non-surgical larynx preservation therapies. (R) • Concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be regarded as the standard of care for non-surgical management. (R) • Subject to the availability of appropriate surgical expertise and multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services, TLM or open partial surgical procedures ± post-operative RT, may be also be appropriate in selected cases. (R) • In the absence of clinical or radiological evidence of nodal disease, elective treatment (RT or surgery ± post-operative RT) is recommended to at least lymph node levels II, III and IV bilaterally. In node positive disease, it is recommended that lymph node levels II-V should be treated on the involved side. If level II nodes are involved, then elective irradiation of ipsilateral level Ib nodes may be considered. (R) • Most patients with T3 supraglottic cancers are suitable for non-surgical larynx preservation therapies. (R) • Concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be regarded as the standard of care for non-surgical management. (R) • Subject to the availability of appropriate surgical expertise and multi-disciplinary rehabilitation services, TLM or open partial surgical procedures ± post-operative RT, may also be appropriate in selected cases. (R) • In the absence of clinical or radiological evidence of nodal disease, elective treatment (RT or surgery ± post-operative RT) is recommended to at least lymph node levels II, III and IV bilaterally. In node positive disease, lymph node levels II-V should be treated on the involved side. (R) • As per the PET-Neck clinical trial, patients with N2 or N3 neck disease who undergo treatment with chemoradiotherapy to their laryngeal primary and experience a complete response with a subsequent negative post-treatment positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) scan do not require an elective neck dissection. In contrast, patients who have a partial response to treatment or have increased uptake on a post-treatment PET-CT scan should have a neck dissection. (R) • Larynx preservation with concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be considered for T4 tumours, unless there is tumour invasion through cartilage into the soft tissues of the neck, in which case total laryngectomy yields better outcomes. (R) • In the absence of clinical or radiological evidence of nodal disease, elective treatment (RT or surgery ± post-operative RT) is recommended to bilateral lymph node levels II, III, IV, V and VI.

336,Laparoscopic Complete Mesocolic Excision for Right-Sided Colon Cancer: Analysis of Feasibility and Safety from a Single Western Center,"Background:
        
      
      Colectomies performed according to complete mesocolic excision (CME) principles have demonstrated an improvement in the quality of surgical specimen and a potential improvement of long-term results. Laparoscopic CME right hemicolectomy is considered a demanding procedure and adopted in few centers from the West. The main purpose of this paper is to present a video showing our technique for laparoscopic CME right hemicolectomy and to analyze our short-term results to prove its safety.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from 38 patients operated on at the Division of General and Hepatobiliary Surgery, University of Verona Hospital Trust, between September 2014 and February 2017, were included in the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the present series, 37% of patients were ≥75 years old, 32% of patients were ASA class 3, 46% of patients had ≥2 comorbidities, 30% of patients had BMI >28 and 17% of patients had ≥2 previous abdominal surgeries. Despite these unfavorable clinic characteristics, no mortality was observed, Clavien-Dindo ≥3 complications occurred in 13.1% and redo surgery in 5.3%. Good quality specimens were obtained with a mean (SD) length of 34.5±7.5 cm, a proximal margin of 16.8±9.2 cm and a distal margin of 14.3±6.4 cm. The mean (SD) number of harvested lymph nodes was 24.3 (8.3).

      When implemented in a Western center, laparoscopic CME right hemicolectomy is feasible and safe and allows obtaining good quality specimens.",9
337,Surgical Approach does not Affect Return to Intended Oncologic Therapy Following Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: A Propensity-Matched Study,"Background:
        
      
      The effect of minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD), including laparoscopic and robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD and RPD, respectively), on compliance and time to return to intended oncologic therapy (RIOT) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unknown.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Patients with nonmetastatic PDAC were analyzed in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Three groups were matched per propensity score: open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) and MIPD, LPD and RPD, and converted and nonconverted patients. RIOT rates and time to RIOT were examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 14,135 patients were included: 11,834 (83.7%) underwent OPD and 2301 (16.3%) underwent MIPD. After score matching, RIOT rates (67.2 vs. 65.3%; p = 0.112) and RIOT within 8 weeks (57.7 vs. 56.4%; p = 0.276) were similar among MIPD and OPD groups, and approach was not a significant predictor of RIOT on multivariable regression. Neither RIOT nor time to RIOT were different among LPD and RPD groups (63.9 vs. 67.0%, and 58.4 vs. 56.9%, respectively). Compared with LPD, RPD was associated with lower conversion rates (HR 0.519; p < 0.001), and conversion was associated with longer median time to RIOT (10 vs. 8 weeks; p = 0.041).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this national cohort, approach did not impact RIOT rates or time to RIOT for patients with PDAC. While conversion was associated with longer median time to RIOT, readiness to commence adjuvant therapy was similar for LPD and RPD.",9
338,Nontechnical skill training and the use of scenarios in modern surgical education,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Nontechnical skills are being increasingly recognized as a core reason of surgical errors. Combined with the changing nature of surgical training, there has therefore been an increase in nontechnical skill research in the literature. This review therefore aims to: define nontechnical skillsets, assess current training methods, explore assessment modalities and suggest future research aims.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      The literature demonstrates an increasing understanding of the components of nontechnical skills within surgery. This has led to a greater availability of validated training methods for its training, including the use of didactic teaching, e-learning and simulation-based scenarios. In addition, there are now various extensively validated assessment tools for nontechnical skills including NOTSS, the Oxford NOTECHS and OTAS. Finally, there is now more focus on the development of tools which target individual nontechnical skill components and an attempt to understand which of these play a greater role in specific procedures such as laparoscopic or robotic surgery.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Current evidence demonstrates various training methods and tools for the training of nontechnical skills. Future research is likely to focus increasingly on individual nontechnical skill components and procedure-specific skills.",3
339,Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer,"Bladder cancer is the commonest malignancy of the urinary tract. In this review, we look at the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of this condition. Cystoscopy and urine cytology are the most important tools in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer. Various alternatives have been investigated, either to reduce the frequency of cystoscopy, or improve its sensitivity for detection of tumors. These include urine-based markers and point-of-care tests. Narrow-band imaging and photodynamic diagnosis/blue-light cystoscopy have shown promise in improving detection and reducing recurrence of bladder tumors, by improving the completion of bladder resection when compared with standard resection in white light. The majority of patients with a new diagnosis of bladder cancer have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which requires adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Recent developments in post-resection intravesical regimens are discussed. For patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, both laparoscopic radical cystectomy and robot-assisted radical cystectomy have been shown to reduce peri-operative morbidity, while being oncologically equivalent to open radical cystectomy in the medium term. Bladder-preserving strategies entail resection and chemoradiation, and in selected patients give equivalent results to surgery. The development, advantages, and disadvantages of these newer approaches are also discussed.",2
340,Coronary Artery Stent for Securing High-risk Pancreatico-jejunal Anastomosis After Pancreatoduodenectomy: A Pilot Series,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the feasibility and clinical utility of coronary artery stent (CAS) in securing pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis (PJ) and avoid stent displacement after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).
    


          Summary of background data:
        
      
      Externalized trans-anastomotic stent (ETS) is a standard mitigation strategy for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) in high-risk patients. However, major morbidity remains extremely elevated, especially in case of ETS malfunction due to displacement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A pilot series of 72 patients underwent PD and PJ with CAS positioning between January 2016 and December 2019. All patients were at high-risk for POPF (soft pancreatic texture; main pancreatic duct diameter ≤ 3 mm) and underwent a CT-scan at postoperative day 5 and 10 to assess the correct CAS positioning. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed, and displacement rates were compared with a cohort of 141 patients with the same high-risk characteristics, undergoing PD with PJ and externalized trans-anastomotic stent (ETS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      No CAS-related complications were registered in the study group. In particular, no CAS displacement was registered, compared to a 28% ETS malfunction (either displacement or occlusion). The POPF rate, major morbidity, and mortality were 11%, 6%, and 0% respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The CAS positioning appears to be a feasible and safe mitigation strategy to secure PJ anastomosis after PD with high POPF risk avoiding stent displacement. Further validation and comparison with current standard of care is required in a prospective controlled setting.",1
341,Role of three dimensional (3D) printing in endourology: An update from EAU young academic urologists (YAU) urolithiasis and endourology working group,"The management of nephrolithiasis has been complemented well by modern technological advancements like virtual reality, three-dimensional (3D) printing etc. In this review, we discuss the applications of 3D printing in treating stone disease using percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). PCNL surgeries, when preceded by a training phase using a 3D printed model, aid surgeons to choose the proper course of action, which results in better procedural outcomes. The 3D printed models have also been extensively used to train junior residents and novice surgeons to improve their proficiency in the procedure. Such novel measures include different approaches employed to 3D print a model, from 3D printing the entire pelvicalyceal system with the surrounding tissues to 3D printing simple surgical guides.",0
342,"A Systematic Review of Patients' Values, Preferences, and Expectations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms","Context:
        
      
      Understanding men's values and preferences in the context of personal, physical, emotional, relational, and social factors is important in optimising patient counselling, facilitating treatment decision-making, and improving guideline recommendations.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically review the available evidence regarding the values, preferences, and expectations of men towards the investigation and treatment (conservative, pharmacological, and surgical) of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      We searched electronic databases until August 31, 2020 for quantitative and qualitative studies that reported values and preferences regarding the investigation and treatment of LUTS in men. We assessed the quality of evidence and risk of bias using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and GRADE Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) approaches.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      We included 25 quantitative studies, three qualitative studies, and one mixed-methods study recruiting 9235 patients. Most men reported urodynamic testing to be acceptable, despite discomfort or embarrassment, as it significantly informs treatment decisions (low certainty evidence). Men preferred conservative and less risky treatment options, but the preference varied depending on baseline symptom severity and the risk/benefit characteristics of the treatment (moderate certainty). Men preferred pharmacological treatments with a low risk of erectile dysfunction and those especially improving urgency incontinence (moderate certainty). Other important preference considerations included reducing the risk of acute urinary retention or surgery (moderate certainty).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Men prefer lower-risk management options that have fewer sexual side effects and are primarily effective at improving urgency incontinence and nocturia. Overall, the evidence was rated to be of low to moderate certainty. This review can facilitate the treatment decision-making process and improve the trustworthiness of guideline recommendations.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We thoroughly reviewed the evidence addressing men's values and preferences regarding the management of urinary symptoms and found that minimising adverse effects is particularly important. Further research to understand other factors that matter to men is required.",3
343,An Absorption Mitigation Technique for Received Signal Strength-Based Target Localization in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks,"Localization is an indispensable technology for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). In what concerns UWSNs, the accurate location information is not only the requirement of the marine field applications but also the basis of the other corresponding research, for instance, network routing and topology control. Recently, an astonishing surge of interest has been drawn in the received signal strength (RSS)-based scheme due to cost-effectiveness and synchronization-free compared with others. However, unlike the terrestrial wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the acoustic signal may suffer the absorption loss in the underwater environment besides the path loss, which degrades the localization accuracy and limits the capability of the RSS-based technology in UWSNs. In this context, a robust localization method with an absorption mitigation technique (AMT) is developed. First, an RSS-based analytically tractable measurement model is conducted, where the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is derived. Nevertheless, it is quite challenging to solve the problem using MLE under a non-convex expression. Therefore, by exploiting certain approximations, the considered localization problem is converted into an optimization expression with a maximum absorption loss involved. A min-max strategy is then presented, with which the problem is turned to minimize the worst situation of the absorption loss. After a simple manipulation, the problem is further investigated as a generalized trust region sub-problem (GTRS) framework. Although the GTRS is a non-convex scheme, the solution can be obtained through an iteration method by introducing a multiplier. In addition, the closed-form expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the analytically tractable measurement model is derived. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in different scenarios.",0
344,"Pancreas-sparing, ampulla-preserving duodenectomy for major duodenal (D1-D2) perforations","Background:
        
      
      Ideal surgical treatment for acute duodenal injuries should offer a definitive treatment, with low morbidity and mortality. It should be simple and easily reproducible by acute care surgeons in an emergency. Duodenal injury, due to major perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers or iatrogenic/traumatic perforation, represents a surgical challenge, with high morbidity and mortality. The aim was to review definitive surgery with pancreas-sparing, ampulla-preserving duodenectomy for these patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Pancreas-sparing, ampulla-preserving D1-D2 duodenectomy was used for patients presenting with major duodenal injuries over a 5-year interval. The ampulla was identified and preserved using a transcystic/transpapillary tube. The outcomes were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten patients were treated with this technique; seven had perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers, two had iatrogenic perforations and one blunt abdominal trauma. Their mean age was 78 (range 65-84) years. Four patients were haemodynamically unstable. The location of the duodenal injury was always D1 and/or D2, above or in close proximity to the ampulla of Vater. The surgical approach was open in nine patients and laparoscopic in one. The mean duration of surgery was 264 (range 170-377) min. All patients were transferred to the ICU after surgery (mean ICU stay 4·4 (range 1-11) days), and the overall mean hospital stay was 17·8 (range 10-32) days. Six patients developed major postoperative complications: cardiorespiratory failure in five and gastrointestinal complications in four. Surgical reoperation was needed in one patient for postoperative necrotizing and bleeding pancreatitis. Two patients died from their complications.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pancreas-sparing, ampulla-preserving D1-D2 duodenectomy for emergency treatment of major duodenal perforations is feasible and associated with satisfactory outcomes.",3
345,Anticoagulation vs Antiplatelet Treatment in Patients with Carotid and Vertebral Artery Dissection: A Study of 370 Patients and Literature Review,"Background:
        
      
      Dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries is an important cause of stroke in young patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study is to compare antithrombotic treatments in patients with carotid and vertebral dissections.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three hundred seventy patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissections were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to analyze the association between treatment and new or recurrent events and clinical outcome.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean follow-up was 24.3 months. In patients with spontaneous dissection, 55% received antiplatelets, 29.4% anticoagulation, and 12.6% combined treatment. New or recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 9.6% of patients on antiplatelets, 10.4% on anticoagulation, and 13.3% on combined treatment. For traumatic dissection, 58.3% received antiplatelets, 26.9% anticoagulation, and 10.2% combined treatment. New or recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 6.9% on antiplatelets, 11.1% on anticoagulation, and 20% on combined treatment. In patients with intracranial dissection, 63.1% were started on antiplatelets, 19.7% on anticoagulation, and 14.5% on combined treatment. Ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 8.5% on antiplatelet treatment, 15.4% on anticoagulation, and 18.2% on combined treatment. In patients with extracranial dissection, 54.4% were on antiplatelets, 28.9% on anticoagulation, and 11.2% on combined treatment. Ischemic and hemorrhagic events occurred in 10.1% on antiplatelet treatment, 9.3% on anticoagulation, and 13.8% on combined treatment. The association between antithrombotic treatment and ischemic/hemorrhagic events and clinical outcome was not significant for all subtypes of dissection.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The rate of new or recurrent events is similar with antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment in treating intracranial and extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection.",2
346,Ninety-day hospital costs associated with prolonged air leak following lung resection,"Objectives:
        
      
      Our goal was to assess the postoperative 90-day hospital costs of patients with prolonged air leak (PAL) including costs incurred after discharge from the initial index hospitalization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a retrospective analysis of 982 patients undergoing lobectomy (898) or segmentectomy (78) (April 2014-August 2018). A total of 167 operations were open, 780 were video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and 28 were robotic. A PAL was defined as an air leak >5 days. The 90-day postoperative costs included all fixed and variable costs incurred during the 90 days following surgery. The postoperative costs of patients with and without PAL were compared. The independent association of PAL with postoperative 90-day costs was tested after adjustment for patient-related factors and other complications by a multivariable regression analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      PAL occurred in 261 patients (27%). Their postoperative stay was 4 days longer than that of those without PAL (9.6 vs 5.7; P < 0.0001). Compared to patients without PAL, those with PAL had 27% higher index postoperative costs [7354€, standard deviation (SD) 7646 vs 5759€, SD 7183, P < 0.0001] and 40% higher 90-day postoperative costs (18 340€, SD 23 312 vs 13 102€, SD 10 264; P < 0.0001). The relative postoperative costs (the difference between 90-day and index postoperative costs) were 50% higher in PAL patients compared to non-PAL patients (P < 0.0001) and accounted for 60% of the total 90-day costs. Multivariable regression analysis showed that PAL remained an independent factor associated with 90-day costs (P < 0.0001) along with the occurrence of other cardiopulmonary complications (P < 0.0001), male gender (P = 0.018), low carbon monoxide lung diffusion capacity (P = 0.043) and thoracotomy approach (P = 0.022).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PAL is associated not only with increased index hospitalization costs but also with increased costs after discharge. Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of measures to prevent air leaks should also include post-discharge costs.",8
347,Ultrasound-guided Needle Biopsy for Preoperative Assessment of Uterine Fibroids: Our Experience and a Review of the Literature,"Leiomyomas are the most common uterine benign tumor, and their malignant counterpart leiomyosarcomas are extremely rare. Despite this, a preoperative diagnosis could be useful for safe surgical minimally invasive management. At present, some clinical and ultrasound findings help recognizing lesions at risk of malignancy. We tried to implement a technique for the preoperative diagnosis for lesions at risk performing ultrasound-guided biopsies of suspected lesions in ten patients. Among them, one case was diagnosed as malignant by the needle biopsy. All patients underwent surgery for myomectomy or hysterectomy, and the histology was confirmed in all cases. No complications occurred. The review of the literature shows other similar experiences of preoperative biopsy of uterine lesions, showing good results for the differential diagnosis between uterine sarcoma and leiomyoma. In our experience, despite the small number of patients enrolled, this technique is safe and effective to plan minimally invasive surgery of uterine fibroids.",0
348,Catheter segmentation in X-ray fluoroscopy using synthetic data and transfer learning with light U-nets,"Background and objectivesAutomated segmentation and tracking of surgical instruments and catheters under X-ray fluoroscopy hold the potential for enhanced image guidance in catheter-based endovascular procedures. This article presents a novel method for real-time segmentation of catheters and guidewires in 2d X-ray images. We employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and propose a transfer learning approach, using synthetic fluoroscopic images, to develop a lightweight version of the U-Net architecture. Our strategy, requiring a small amount of manually annotated data, streamlines the training process and results in a U-Net model, which achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art segmentation, with a decreased number of trainable parameters. MethodsThe proposed transfer learning approach exploits high-fidelity synthetic images generated from real fluroscopic backgrounds. We implement a two-stage process, initial end-to-end training and fine-tuning, to develop two versions of our model, using synthetic and phantom fluoroscopic images independently. A small number of manually annotated in-vivo images is employed to fine-tune the deepest 7 layers of the U-Net architecture, producing a network specialized for pixel-wise catheter/guidewire segmentation. The network takes as input a single grayscale image and outputs the segmentation result as a binary mask against the background. ResultsEvaluation is carried out with images from in-vivo fluoroscopic video sequences from six endovascular procedures, with different surgical setups. We validate the effectiveness of developing the U-Net models using synthetic data, in tests where fine-tuning and testing in-vivo takes place both by dividing data from all procedures into independent fine-tuning/testing subsets as well as by using different in-vivo sequences. Accurate catheter/guidewire segmentation (average Dice coefficient of ~ 0.55, ~ 0.26 and ~ 0.17) is obtained with both U-Net models. Compared to the state-of-the-art CNN models, the proposed U-Net achieves comparable performance ( ± 5% average Dice coefficients) in terms of segmentation accuracy, while yielding a 84% reduction of the testing time. This adds flexibility for real-time operation and makes our network adaptable to increased input resolution. ConclusionsThis work presents a new approach in the development of CNN models for pixel-wise segmentation of surgical catheters in X-ray fluoroscopy, exploiting synthetic images and transfer learning. Our methodology reduces the need for manually annotating large volumes of data for training. This represents an important advantage, given that manual pixel-wise annotations is a key bottleneck in developing CNN segmentation models. Combined with a simplified U-Net model, our work yields significant advantages compared to current state-of-the-art solutions.",4
349,Microbiome studies in urology- where do we stand and where can we reach?,"The role of microbiome milieu in the urinary tract, their interplay in diverse urological conditions and their therapeutic implications are not completely understood. The microbiome has contributed towards urinary tract infections, urolithiasis and urological cancers. The possibility of manipulating microbiome for diagnosis and treatment is evolving. Probiotics might help in overcoming the problems of recurrent infection and antibiotic resistance. Novel applications like stents and catheters coated with non-pathogenic organisms are being developed. Research in the urinary microbiome has progressed from using mouse models to the presently available three- dimensional cultured organoids, thus making it more feasible. As our knowledge regarding the urinary microbiome increases, justice can be done to many patients in whom the advancements can be used for prophylaxis, diagnosis, treatment and even in improving their quality of life. The growing amount of antibiotic resistance is also a matter of concern and probiotics might be the answer to this upcoming calamity. In this review, we have discussed the role of the urinary microbiome in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of urological conditions and pondered upon its future prospects.",3
350,The morbidity of laparoscopic radical cystectomy: analysis of postoperative complications in a multicenter cohort by the European Association of Urology (EAU)-Section of Uro-Technology,"Purpose:
        
      
      To analyze postoperative complications after laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) and evaluate its risk factors in a large prospective cohort built by the ESUT across European centers involved in minimally invasive urology in the last decade.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients were prospectively enrolled, and data were retrospectively analyzed. Only oncologic cases were included. There were no formal contraindications for LRC: Also patients with locally advanced tumors (pT4a), serious comorbidities, and previous major abdominal surgery were enrolled. All procedures were performed via a standard laparoscopic approach, with no robotic assistance. Early and late postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore possible risk factors for developing complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 548 patients were available for final analysis, of which 258 (47%) experienced early complications during the first 90 days after LRC. Infectious, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary were, respectively, the most frequent systems involved. Postoperative ileus occurred in 51/548 (9.3%) patients. A total of 65/548 (12%) patients underwent surgical re-operation, and 10/548 (2%) patients died in the early postoperative period. Increased BMI (p = 0.024), blood loss (p = 0.021), and neoadjuvant treatment (p = 0.016) were significantly associated with a greater overall risk of experiencing complications on multivariate logistic regression. Long-term complications were documented in 64/548 (12%), and involved mainly stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis or incisional hernias.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this multicenter, prospective, large database, LRC appears to be a safe but morbid procedure. Standardized complication reporting should be encouraged to evaluate objectively a surgical procedure and permit comparison across studies.",3
351,Predictors of extended length of stay after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty,"Purpose:
        
      
      To identify factors that independently predict extended length of stay after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) surgery (defined as length of stay longer than 3 days), and to identify factors predicting early post-operative complications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing UKA from January 2016-January 2019 at our institution was performed. Clinical notes were reviewed to determine the following information: Patient age (years), gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, weight (kg), height (meters), body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, indication for surgery, surgeon, surgical volume, surgical technique (navigated or patient-specific instrumentation), implant manufacturer, estimated blood loss (ml), application of tourniquet during the surgery, application of drain, hospital length of stay (days) and surgical complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Multivariate regression analysis showed that ASA 3-4 vs. ASA 1-2 [OR 4.4 (CI; 1.8-10.8, p = 0.001)] and a history of cardiovascular disease [OR 2.8 (CI; 1.4-5.5), p = 0.004)] were significant independent predictors of prolonged length of stay. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit of the model showed a p-value of 0.214. Nagelkerke R-Square was 0.2. For complications, multivariate regression analysis showed that ASA 3-4 vs. ASA 1-2 [OR 5.8 (CI; 1.7-20.7)] and high BMI (BMI >30) [OR 4.3 (CI; 1.1-17.1)] were significant independent predictors of complications. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit was 0.89 and Nagelkerke R-Square was 0.2. Patients treated with robotics (Navio) techniques had shorter length of stay median 51 h (IQR; 29-96) when compared to other techniques 72 h (IQR; 52-96), p = 0.008.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Based on the results of our study, high ASA grade (≥3) appears to be the most important factor excluding eligibility for fast-track UKA. Any number of co-morbidities may increase ASA, but in and of themselves, apart from a history of cardiovascular disease, they should not be seen as contraindications. Appropriate patient selection, technical tools and details during the surgery could facilitate fast track surgery.",8
352,The effect of fractional inspired oxygen concentration on early warning score performance: A database analysis,"Objectives:
        
      
      To calculate fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) thresholds in ward patients and add these to the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). To evaluate the performance of NEWS-FiO2 against NEWS when predicting in-hospital death and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multi-centre, retrospective, observational cohort study was carried out in five hospitals from two UK NHS Trusts. Adult admissions with at least one complete set of vital sign observations recorded electronically were eligible. The primary outcome measure was an 'adverse event' which comprised either in-hospital death or unplanned ICU admission. Discrimination was assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A cohort of 83,304 patients from a total of 271,363 adult admissions were prescribed oxygen. In this cohort, NEWS-FiO2 (AUROC 0.823, 95% CI 0.819-0.824) outperformed NEWS (AUORC 0.811, 95% CI 0.809-0.814) when predicting in-hospital death or unplanned ICU admission within 24 h of a complete set of vital sign observations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      NEWS-FiO2 generates a performance gain over NEWS when studied in ward patients requiring oxygen. This warrants further study, particularly in patients with respiratory disorders.",0
353,Cellular community detection for tissue phenotyping in colorectal cancer histology images,"Classification of various types of tissue in cancer histology images based on the cellular compositions is an important step towards the development of computational pathology tools for systematic digital profiling of the spatial tumor microenvironment. Most existing methods for tissue phenotyping are limited to the classification of tumor and stroma and require large amount of annotated histology images which are often not available. In the current work, we pose the problem of identifying distinct tissue phenotypes as finding communities in cellular graphs or networks. First, we train a deep neural network for cell detection and classification into five distinct cellular components. Considering the detected nuclei as nodes, potential cell-cell connections are assigned using Delaunay triangulation resulting in a cell-level graph. Based on this cell graph, a feature vector capturing potential cell-cell connection of different types of cells is computed. These feature vectors are used to construct a patch-level graph based on chi-square distance. We map patch-level nodes to the geometric space by representing each node as a vector of geodesic distances from other nodes in the network and iteratively drifting the patch nodes in the direction of positive density gradients towards maximum density regions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a publicly available dataset and another new large-scale dataset consisting of 280K patches of seven tissue phenotypes. The estimated communities have significant biological meanings as verified by the expert pathologists. A comparison with current state-of-the-art methods reveals significant performance improvement in tissue phenotyping.",0
354,Transmuscular quadratus lumborum block reduces opioid consumption and prolongs time to first opioid demand after laparoscopic nephrectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic and hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomies are often associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain. The aim of the current study was to investigate the analgesic efficacy of the transmuscular quadratus lumborum (TQL) block for patients undergoing robotic or hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fifty patients were included in this single-center study. All patients were scheduled for elective hand-assisted or robotic laparoscopic nephrectomy under general anesthesia. Preoperatively, patients were randomly allocated to TQL block bilaterally with ropivacaine 60 mL 0.375% or 60 mL saline and all patients received standard multimodal analgesia and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. Primary outcome was postoperative oral morphine equivalent (OME) consumption 0-12 hours. Secondary outcomes were postoperative OME consumption up to 24 hours, pain scores, time to first opioid, nausea/vomiting, time to first ambulation and hospital length of stay (LOS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean (95% CI) OME consumption was significantly lower in the intervention group at 12 hours after surgery 50 (28.5 to 71.5) mg versus control 87.5 (62.7 to 112.3) mg, p=0.02. At 24 hours, 69.4 (43.2 to 95.5) mg versus 127 (96.7 to 158.6) mg, p<0.01. Time to first opioid was significantly prolonged in the intervention group median (IQR) 4.4 (2.8-17.6) hours compared with 0.3 (0.1-1.0) hours in the control group, p<0.001. No significant intergroup differences were recorded for time to first ambulation, pain scores, nausea/vomiting nor for LOS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Preoperative bilateral TQL block significantly reduced postoperative opioid consumption by 43% and significantly prolonged time to first opioid.

355,Lateral soft-tissue structures contribute to cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty stability,"Little information is available to surgeons regarding how the lateral structures prevent instability in the replaced knee. The aim of this study was to quantify the lateral soft-tissue contributions to stability following cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (CR TKA). Nine cadaveric knees were tested in a robotic system at full extension, 30°, 60°, and 90° flexion angles. In both native and CR implanted states, ±90 N anterior-posterior force, ±8 Nm varus-valgus, and ±5 Nm internal-external torque were applied. The anterolateral structures (ALS, including the iliotibial band), the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), the popliteus tendon complex (Pop T), and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) were transected and their relative contributions to stabilizing the applied loads were quantified. The LCL was found to be the primary restraint to varus laxity (an average 56% across all flexion angles), and was significant in internal-external rotational stability (28% and 26%, respectively) and anterior drawer (16%). The ALS restrained 25% of internal rotation, while the PCL was significant in posterior drawer only at 60° and 90° flexion. The Pop T was not found to be significant in any tests. Therefore, the LCL was confirmed as the major lateral structure in CR TKA stability throughout the arc of flexion and deficiency could present a complex rotational laxity that cannot be overcome by the other passive lateral structures or the PCL. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

356,Objective selection of epilepsy-related independent components from EEG data,"Background:
        
      
      Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly used for the identification of sources of interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) data, but the selection of the relevant components remains an open issue depending on the specific application.
    


          New method:
        
      
      We propose a novel approach for the objective selection of epilepsy-related independent components (ICs) from EEG data collected during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, called PROJection onto Independent Components (PROJIC). Inter-ictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are identified on a reference EEG dataset collected outside the MRI scanner by an expert neurophysiologist, and the resulting average IED is projected onto the IC space of the EEG data collected simultaneously with fMRI. The power of the IED projection is then used to inform a k-means clustering algorithm of the ICs, allowing for the classification of epilepsy-related ICs.
    


          Comparison with existing methods:
        
      
      The performance of PROJIC was compared with two methods previously proposed for the objective selection of EEG ICs of interest, which are based on the explicit similarity of the ICs with spatio-temporal templates of the events of interest, instead of the projection power.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The proposed PROJIC method outperformed the others for both artificial and real data (19 datasets collected from 6 patients with drug-refractory focal epilepsy), with an average accuracy of 98.6%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The ability of our method to accurately and objectively select epilepsy-related ICs makes it an important contribution for simultaneous EEG-fMRI epilepsy studies, with potential applications in the analysis of event-related EEG activity more generally, and also in EEG artefact correction.",0
357,"A systematic review evaluating the implementation of technologies to assess, monitor and treat neurodevelopmental disorders: A map of the current evidence","Technology-based interventions provide an attractive option for improving service provision for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), for example, widening access to interventions, objective assessment, and monitoring; however, it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to support their use in clinical settings. This review provides an evidence map describing how technology is implemented in the assessment/diagnosis and monitoring/ treatment of NDD (Prospero CRD42018091156). Using predefined search terms in six databases, 7982 articles were identified, 808 full-texts were screened, resulting in 47 included papers. These studies were appraised and synthesised according to the following outcomes of interest: effectiveness (clinical effectiveness/ service delivery efficiencies), economic impact, and user impact (acceptability/ feasibility). The findings describe how technology is currently being utilised clinically, highlights gaps in knowledge, and discusses future research needs. Technology has been used to facilitate assessment and treatment across multiple NDD, especially Autism Spectrum (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) disorders. Technologies include mobile apps/tablets, robots, gaming, computerised tests, videos, and virtual reality. The outcomes presented largely focus on the clinical effectiveness of the technology, with approximately half the papers demonstrating some degree of effectiveness, however, the methodological quality of many studies is limited. Further research should focus on randomised controlled trial designs with longer follow-up periods, incorporating an economic evaluation, as well as qualitative studies including process evaluations and user impact.",0
358,The Facts and Myths for the Use of Lasers in Orthopedic Surgery,"For the past three decades, laser use has been investigated, mainly on implant applications, as well as hard and soft tissue processing on orthopedics. However, despite significant technological advances and achievements in Biophotonics, lasers have yet to emerge as a successful tool for hard-tissue manipulation (e.g., osseous tissue). Indeed, a careful search in relevant literature reveals a limited number of laser-based clinical applications in orthopedics, except for the low-level laser therapy applications. In this review article, we give a brief overview of the biophysical mechanisms of bone tissue and biocompatible implants laser surgery and, in parallel, we summarize some specific pre-clinical and clinical laser applications in orthopedics. Taking into consideration the complexity of laser-based applications in inhomogeneous musculoskeletal biostructures and/or implants, it is justified to state that applying laser radiation is still an open field of multidisciplinary research before performing interventions in clinical praxis. The evidence from this study indicates the need for more experimental and theoretical studies regarding light transport on soft and hard tissues, in order to further enhance safe and efficient laser applications in orthopedics. This undoubtedly implies the need for developing modern light delivery devices for laser surgery, by means of implementing robotic guidance, specialized for medical procedures on various anatomic structures. The aforementioned studies could eventually revolutionize the clinical applications of laser technology in orthopedics.",1
359,The role of fibers in the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament in resisting tibial displacement,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose was to clarify the load-bearing functions of the fibers of the femoral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) attachment in resisting tibial anterior drawer and rotation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A sequential cutting study was performed on 8 fresh-frozen human knees. The femoral attachment of the ACL was divided into a central area that had dense fibers inserting directly into the femur and anterior and posterior fan-like extension areas. The ACL fibers were cut sequentially from the bone: the posterior fan-like area in 2 stages, the central dense area in 4 stages, and then the anterior fan-like area in 2 stages. Each knee was mounted in a robotic joint testing system that applied tibial anteroposterior 6-mm translations and 10° or 15° of internal rotation at 0° to 90° of flexion. The reduction of restraining force or moment was measured after each cut.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The central area resisted 82% to 90% of the anterior drawer force; the anterior fan-like area, 2% to 3%; and the posterior fan-like area, 11% to 15%. Among the 4 central areas, most load was carried close to the roof of the intercondylar notch: the anteromedial bundle resisted 66% to 84% of the force and the posterolateral bundle resisted 16% to 9% from 0° to 90° of flexion. There was no clear pattern for tibial internal rotation, with the load shared among the posterodistal and central areas near extension and mostly the central areas in flexion.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Under the experimental conditions described, 66% to 84% of the resistance to tibial anterior drawer arose from the ACL fibers at the central-proximal area of the femoral attachment, corresponding to the anteromedial bundle; the fan-like extension fibers contributed very little. This work did not support moving a single-bundle ACL graft to the side wall of the notch or attempting to cover the whole attachment area if the intention was to mimic how the natural ACL resists tibial displacements.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      There is ongoing debate about how best to reconstruct the ACL to restore normal knee function, including where is the best place for ACL graft tunnels. This study found that the most important area on the femur, in terms of resisting displacement of the tibia, was in the central-anterior part of the femoral ACL attachment, near the roof of the intercondylar notch. The testing protocol did not lead to data that would support using a large ACL graft tunnel that attempts to cover the whole natural femoral attachment area.",7
360,The impact of radical prostatectomy on the social well-being of prostate cancer survivors: A qualitative meta-synthesis,"Introduction:
        
      
      The impact of radical prostatectomy on the social well-being of survivors remains poorly understood. This meta-synthesis therefore aimed to integrate the findings of qualitative research evaluating the impact of surgery on the patient relationships with partners, family and wider societal interactions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase were searched for qualitative studies evaluating social well-being dimensions. A thematic meta-synthesis was conducted to inductively construct descriptive themes and overarching analytical themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-one articles were included, with seven descriptive themes under two analytical themes generated to describe the experiences of 469 participants. 'Pathway to Conversion' encompassed three themes on the evolving social behaviour of men with both partners and family to adapt to their new normality postoperatively. 'A Man on My Own' discussed four themes focussing on both intimate and wider social relations, describing the stigma, shame and embarrassment felt by patients due to changes in their perceived body image and physical function. This resulted in men feeling alone, unsupported and seeking isolation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Radical prostatectomy's impact on survivors' social well-being extends beyond surgery and causes a shift in their relationship dynamics with partner and family, highlighting the importance of preoperative and postoperative clinician's counselling to both patient and partner.",5
361,Rapid uropathogen identification using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy active filters,"Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial infections leading to increased morbidity, mortality and societal costs. Current diagnostics exacerbate this problem due to an inability to provide timely pathogen identification. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has the potential to overcome these issues by providing immediate bacterial classification. To date, achieving accurate classification has required technically complicated processes to capture pathogens, which has precluded the integration of SERS into rapid diagnostics. This work demonstrates that gold-coated membrane filters capture and aggregate bacteria, separating them from urine, while also providing Raman signal enhancement. An optimal gold coating thickness of 50 nm was demonstrated, and the diagnostic performance of the SERS-active filters was assessed using phantom urine infection samples at clinically relevant concentrations (105 CFU/ml). Infected and uninfected (control) samples were identified with an accuracy of 91.1%. Amongst infected samples only, classification of three bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) was achieved at a rate of 91.6%.",0
362,Multiplexed ChIP-Seq Using Direct Nucleosome Barcoding: A Tool for High-Throughput Chromatin Analysis,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) or microarray hybridization (ChIP-on-chip) are standard methods for the study of transcription factor binding sites and histone chemical modifications. However, these approaches only allow profiling of a single factor or protein modification at a time.In this chapter, we present Bar-ChIP, a higher throughput version of ChIP-Seq that relies on the direct ligation of molecular barcodes to chromatin fragments. Bar-ChIP enables the concurrent profiling of multiple DNA-protein interactions and is therefore amenable to experimental scale-up, without the need for any robotic instrumentation.",1

          Materials & methods:
        
      
      A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out. EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to September 2020. All primary studies were considered for inclusion. Primary outcome measure was detection rates of primary cancer of the different techniques. Secondary outcome measures were complications and length of hospital stay.
    


          Results:
        
      
      289 studies were identified of which 30 met the inclusion criteria. The primary cancer was identified in 567 /777 patients (pooled results was 64% (95% CI 54-73). The primary identification rates were 45% and 32% in lingual (n = 273) and palatine tonsillectomy (n = 118) respectively. The primary cancer identification rates by surgical techniques are: TORS was 60% (95% CI 49-70), TLM was 80% (95% CI 0.58, 1.01), TOEC was 41% (95% CI 0.05, 0.76). 529/777 (68%) tumours were Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) related. The pooled data of studies that reported on detection rates relating to HPV status were 178/216 (82%) for HPV +ve and 7/59 (12%) for HPV -ve tumours. Coefficient of variation results suggest heterogenous data for TORS and TLM. The commonest complication was haemorrhage (5.3%). The length of reported hospital stay ranged from 1.4 to 7 days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the largest systematic review in the subject. The quality of studies and heterogeneity of data limit conclusive findings. Lingual tonsillectomy is an effective procedure in CUP work up. Further larger, multicentre, prospective studies of PET CT negative CUP patients is needed to draw conclusive results.",1
364,Optimizing maternal fat suppression with constrained image-based shimming in fetal MR,"Purpose:
        
      
      Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the primary sequence for functional and diffusion MRI. In fetal applications, the large field of view needed to encode the maternal abdomen leads to prolonged EPI readouts, which may be further extended due to safety considerations that limit gradient performance. The resulting images become very sensitive to water-fat shift and susceptibility artefacts. The purpose of this study was to reduce artefacts and increase stability of EPI in fetal brain imaging, balancing local field homogeneity across the fetal brain with longer range variations to ensure compatibility with fat suppression of the maternal abdomen.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Spectral Pre-saturation with Inversion-Recovery (SPIR) fat suppression was optimized by investigating SPIR pulse frequency offsets. Subsequently, fetal brain EPI data were acquired using image-based (IB) shimming on 6 pregnant women by (1) minimizing B0 field variations within the fetal brain (localized IB shimming) and (2) with added constraint to limit B0 variation in maternal fat (fat constrained IB shimming).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The optimal offset for the SPIR pulse at 3 Tesla was 550 Hz. Both shimming approaches had similar performances in terms of B0 homogeneity within the brain, but constrained IB shimming enabled higher fat suppression efficiency.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Optimized SPIR in combination with constrained IB shimming can improve maternal fat suppression while minimizing EPI distortions in the fetal brain.",0
365,Protocol for CAMUS Delphi Study: A Consensus on Comprehensive Reporting and Grading of Complications After Urological Surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Reproducible assessment of postoperative complications is essential for reliable evaluation of quality of care to enable comparison between healthcare centres and ensure transparent patient counselling. Currently, significant discrepancies exist in complication reporting and grading due to heterogeneous definitions and methodologies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To develop a standardised and reproducible assessment of perioperative complications and overall associated morbidity, to allow for the construction of a uniform language for complication reporting and grading.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      The 12-part REDCap-based Delphi survey was developed in conjunction with methodologist review and experienced urologist opinion. International urologists, anaesthetists, and intensive care unit specialists will be included. A minimum sample size of 750 participants (500 urologists and 250 critical care specialities) is targeted.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      The survey assesses participant demographics, opinion on complication reporting and the proposed Complications After Major & Minor Urological Surgery (CAMUS) reporting recommendations, grading of intervention events using the existing Clavien-Dindo classification and the proposed CAMUS classification, and rating of various clinical scenarios. Consensus will be defined as ≥75% majority agreement. If consensus is not reached, then subsequent Delphi rounds will be performed under steering committee guidance.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Twenty-one participants completed the draft survey. The median survey completion time was 128 min (interquartile range 88-135). The survey revealed that 90% of participants believe that the current complication classification systems are useful but inaccurate, while 100% of participants believe that there is a universal demand for reporting consensus. Several amendments were made following feedback. Limitations include complexity of the proposed supplemental grades and time to completion of the survey.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      To ensure comprehensive and comparable complication reporting and grading across centres worldwide, a conclusive uniform language for complication reporting must be created. We intend to address shortcomings of the current complication reporting and classification systems with a new CAMUS classification system developed through multidisciplinary expert consensus obtained through a Delphi survey. Ultimately, standardisation of urological complication reporting and grading may improve patient counselling and quality of care.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      The reporting and grading of operative complications that occur during or after an operation and associated costs provide a means to stratify quality of patient care. Current complication reporting and classification systems are not standardised and somewhat inaccurate, and thus significantly underestimate patient morbidity and surgical risk. This Delphi survey will provide the basis for the creation of a uniform complication reporting and grading system. Our new system may allow improved reporting and grading between centres, and ultimately improve patient counselling and care.",3
366,Traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage control: has current technology tipped the balance toward a role for prehospital intervention?,"Background:
        
      
      The identification and control of traumatic hemorrhage from the torso remains a major challenge and carries a significant mortality despite the reduction of transfer times. This review examines the current technologies that are available for abdominal hemorrhage control within the prehospital setting and evaluates their effectiveness.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search of online databases was undertaken. Where appropriate, evidence was highlighted using the Oxford levels of clinical evidence. The primary outcome assessed was mortality, and secondary outcomes included blood loss and complications associated with each technique.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 89 studies, 34 met the inclusion criteria, of which 29 were preclinical in vivo trials and 5 were clinical. Techniques were subdivided into mechanical compression, endovascular control, and energy-based hemostatic devices. Gas insufflation and manual pressure techniques had no associated mortalities. There was one mortality with high intensity focused ultrasound. The intra-abdominal infiltration of foam treatment had 64% and the resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta had 74% mortality risk reduction. In the majority of cases, morbidity and blood loss associated with each interventional procedure were less than their respective controls.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Mortality from traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage could be reduced through early intervention at the scene by emerging technology. Manual pressure or the resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta techniques have demonstrated clinical effectiveness for the control of major vessel bleeding, although complications need to be carefully considered before advocating clinical use. At present, fast transfer to the trauma center remains paramount.

367,Public Disclosure on Social Media of Identifiable Patient Information by Health Professionals: Content Analysis of Twitter Data,"Background:
        
      
      Respecting patient privacy and confidentiality is critical for doctor-patient relationships and public trust in medical professionals. The frequency of potentially identifiable disclosures online during periods of active engagement is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this study was to quantify potentially identifiable content shared on social media by physicians and other health care providers using the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We accessed and searched Twitter's API using Symplur software for tweets that included the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. We identified 1206 tweets by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals out of 43,374 tweets shared in May 2018. Tweet content was evaluated in January 2019 to determine the incidence of instances where names or potentially identifiable information about patients were shared; content analysis of tweets in which information about others had been disclosed was performed. The study also evaluated whether participants raised concerns about privacy breaches and estimated the frequency of deleted tweets. The study used dual, blinded coding for a 10% sample to estimate intercoder reliability using Cohen κ statistic for identifying the potential identifiability of tweet content.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Health care professionals (n=656) disclosing information about others included 486 doctors (74.1%) and 98 nurses (14.9%). Health care professionals sharing stories about patient care disclosed the time frame in 95 tweets (95/754, 12.6%) and included patient names in 15 tweets (15/754, 2.0%). It is estimated that friends or families could likely identify the clinical scenario described in 242 of the 754 tweets (32.1%). Among 348 tweets about potentially living patients, it was estimated that 162 (46.6%) were likely identifiable by patients. Intercoder reliability in rating the potential identifiability demonstrated 86.8% agreement, with a Cohen κ of 0.8 suggesting substantial agreement. We also identified 78 out of 754 tweets (6.5%) that had been deleted on the website but were still viewable in the analytics software data set.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      During periods of active sharing online, nurses, physicians, and other health professionals may sometimes share more information than patients or families might expect. More study is needed to determine whether similar events arise frequently and to understand how to best ensure that patients' rights are adequately respected.",6
368,Comparison of Short-term Results after Laparoscopic Complete Mesocolic Excision and Standard Colectomy for Right-Sided Colon Cancer: Analysis of a Western Center Cohort,"Purpose:
        
      
      Laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) right colectomy is a technically demanding procedure infrequently employed in Western centers. This retrospective cohort study aims to analyze the safety of laparoscopic CME colectomy compared to standard colectomy for right-sided colon cancer in a Western series.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prospectively collected data from 60 patients who underwent laparoscopic CME right colectomy were compared to the ones of 55 patients who underwent laparoscopic standard right colectomy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No differences in clinical characteristics were observed between the CME and standard right colectomy groups. No differences were demonstrated in terms of blood loss (P = 0.060), intraoperative complications (P = 1), conversion rate (P = 0.102), and operative time (P = 0.473). No deaths were observed in either group, while complication rate was 40.0% in the CME and 49.1% in the standard group (P = 0.353). Severe complications occurred in 10.0% vs. 9.1% (P = 0.842), redo surgery in 5.0% vs. 7.3% (P = 0.708), and unplanned readmission in 5.0% vs. 5.5% (P = 1) after CME and standard colectomy, respectively. A significant difference in favor of CME was observed in the total length of specimen (P < 0.001), proximal (P = 0.018), and distal margins (P = 0.037). The number of lymph nodes harvested was significantly higher in the CME group (27 vs. 22, P = 0.037).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In Western series, where patients have less favorable clinical characteristics, laparoscopic CME allows to obtain better quality surgical specimens and comparable short-term outcomes compared to standard right colectomy.",9
369,Religious Fasting of Muslim Patients After Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: a Modified Delphi Consensus,"Background:
        
      
      Fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith. Despite the positive effects of fasting on health, there are no guidelines or clear recommendations regarding fasting after metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS). The current study reports the result of a modified Delphi consensus among expert metabolic/bariatric surgeons with experience in managing patients who fast after MBS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A committee of 61 well-known metabolic and bariatric surgeons from 24 countries was created to participate in the Delphi consensus. The committee voted on 45 statements regarding recommendations and controversies around fasting after MBS. An agreement/disagreement ≥ of 70.0% was regarded as consensus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The experts reached a consensus on 40 out of 45 statements after two rounds of voting. One hundred percent of the experts believed that fasting needs special nutritional support in patients who underwent MBS. The decision regarding fasting must be coordinated among the surgeon, the nutritionist and the patient. At any time after MBS, 96.7% advised stopping fasting in the presence of persistent symptoms of intolerance. Seventy percent of the experts recommended delaying fasting after MBS for 6 to 12 months after combined and malabsorptive procedures according to the patient's situation and surgeon's experience, and 90.1% felt that proton pump inhibitors should be continued in patients who start fasting less than 6 months after MBS. There was consensus that fasting may help in weight loss, improvement/remission of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus among 88.5%, 90.2%, 88.5%, 85.2% and 85.2% of experts, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Experts voted and reached a consensus on 40 statements covering various aspects of fasting after MBS.",3
370,Augmented Reality in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery: Scoping Review,"Background:
        
      
      Technological advances have transformed vascular intervention in recent decades. In particular, improvements in imaging and data processing have allowed for the development of increasingly complex endovascular and hybrid interventions. Augmented reality (AR) is a subject of growing interest in surgery, with the potential to improve clinicians' understanding of 3D anatomy and aid in the processing of real-time information. This study hopes to elucidate the potential impact of AR technology in the rapidly evolving fields of vascular and endovascular surgery.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this review is to summarize the fundamental concepts of AR technologies and conduct a scoping review of the impact of AR and mixed reality in vascular and endovascular surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. All studies written in English from inception until January 8, 2021, were included in the search. Combinations of the following keywords were used in the systematic search string: (""augmented reality"" OR ""hololens"" OR ""image overlay"" OR ""daqri"" OR ""magic leap"" OR ""immersive reality"" OR ""extended reality"" OR ""mixed reality"" OR ""head mounted display"") AND (""vascular surgery"" OR ""endovascular""). Studies were selected through a blinded process between 2 investigators (JE and AS) and assessed using data quality tools.
    


          Results:
        
      
      AR technologies have had a number of applications in vascular and endovascular surgery. Most studies (22/32, 69%) used 3D imaging of computed tomography angiogram-derived images of vascular anatomy to augment clinicians' anatomical understanding during procedures. A wide range of AR technologies were used, with heads up fusion imaging and AR head-mounted displays being the most commonly applied clinically. AR applications included guiding open, robotic, and endovascular surgery while minimizing dissection, improving procedural times, and reducing radiation and contrast exposure.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      AR has shown promising developments in the field of vascular and endovascular surgery, with potential benefits to surgeons and patients alike. These include reductions in patient risk and operating times as well as in contrast and radiation exposure for radiological interventions. Further technological advances are required to overcome current limitations, including processing capacity and vascular deformation by instrumentation.",1
371,"Training, Simulation, the Learning Curve, and How to Reduce Complications in Urology","Context:
        
      
      Urology is at the forefront of minimally invasive surgery to a great extent. These procedures produce additional learning challenges and possess a steep initial learning curve. Training and assessment methods in surgical specialties such as urology are known to lack clear structure and often rely on differing operative flow experienced by individuals and institutions.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This article aims to assess current urology training modalities, to identify the role of simulation within urology, to define and identify the learning curves for various urologic procedures, and to discuss ways to decrease complications in the context of training.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A narrative review of the literature was conducted through December 2015 using the PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      Evidence of the validity of training methods in urology includes observation of a procedure, mentorship and fellowship, e-learning, and simulation-based training. Learning curves for various urologic procedures have been recommended based on the available literature. The importance of structured training pathways is highlighted, with integration of modular training to ensure patient safety.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Valid training pathways are available in urology. The aim in urology training should be to combine all of the available evidence to produce procedure-specific curricula that utilise the vast array of training methods available to ensure that we continue to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      The current evidence for different training methods available in urology, including simulation-based training, was reviewed, and the learning curves for various urologic procedures were critically analysed. Based on the evidence, future pathways for urology curricula have been suggested to ensure that patient safety is improved.",3
372,Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver a spatially conformal dose of radiation to tumours while maximizing the dose sparing to healthy tissues. However, the internal patient anatomy is constantly moving due to respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal and urinary activity. The long term goal of the RT community to 'see what we treat, as we treat' and to act on this information instantaneously has resulted in rapid technological innovation. Specialized treatment machines, such as robotic or gimbal-steered linear accelerators (linac) with in-room imaging suites, have been developed specifically for real-time treatment adaptation. Additional equipment, such as stereoscopic kilovoltage (kV) imaging, ultrasound transducers and electromagnetic transponders, has been developed for intrafraction motion monitoring on conventional linacs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been integrated with cobalt treatment units and more recently with linacs. In addition to hardware innovation, software development has played a substantial role in the development of motion monitoring methods based on respiratory motion surrogates and planar kV or Megavoltage (MV) imaging that is available on standard equipped linacs. In this paper, we review and compare the different intrafraction motion monitoring methods proposed in the literature and demonstrated in real-time on clinical data as well as their possible future developments. We then discuss general considerations on validation and quality assurance for clinical implementation. Besides photon RT, particle therapy is increasingly used to treat moving targets. However, transferring motion monitoring technologies from linacs to particle beam lines presents substantial challenges. Lessons learned from the implementation of real-time intrafraction monitoring for photon RT will be used as a basis to discuss the implementation of these methods for particle RT.",0
373,Feasibility of support vector machine learning in age-related macular degeneration using small sample yielding sparse optical coherence tomography data,"Purpose:
        
      
      A retrospective pilot study is conducted to demonstrate the utility of a novel support vector machine learning (SVML) algorithm in a small three-dimensional (3D) sample yielding sparse optical coherence tomography (spOCT) data for the automatic monitoring of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wAMD).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection database, 588 consecutive pairs of OCT volumes (57.624 B-scans) were selected in 70 randomly chosen wAMD patients treated with ranibizumab. The SVML algorithm was applied to 183 OCT volume pairs (17.934 B-scans) in 30 patients. Four independent, diagnosis-blinded retina specialists indicated whether wAMD activity was present between 100 pairs of consecutive OCT volumes (9800 B-scans) in the remaining 40 patients for comparison with the SVML algorithm and a non-complex baseline algorithm using only retinal thickness. The SVML algorithm was assessed using inter-observer variability and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The retina specialists showed an average Cohen's κ of 0.57 ± 0.13 (minimum: 0.41, maximum: 0.83). The average κ between the proposed algorithm and the retina specialists was 0.62 ± 0.05 and 0.43 ± 0.14 between the baseline algorithm and the retina specialists. Using each of the four retina specialists as the reference, the proposed method showed a superior area under the ROC curve of 0.91 ± 0.03 compared to the ROC 0.81 ± 0.05 shown by the baseline algorithm.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The SVML algorithm was as effective as the retina specialists were in detecting activity in wAMD. Support vector machine learning (SVML) may be a useful monitoring tool in wAMD suited for small samples that yield sparse OCT data possibly derived from self-measuring OCT-robots.",0
374,Beyond transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: available techniques and approaches,"Objectives:
        
      
      Recent advances have led to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone or with fusion to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images for guiding biopsy of the prostate. Our group sought to develop consensus recommendations regarding MRI-guided prostate biopsy based on currently available literature and expert opinion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The published literature on the subject of MRI-guided prostate biopsy was reviewed using standard search terms and synthesized and analyzed by four different subgroups from among the authors. The literature was grouped into four categories-MRI-guided biopsy platforms, robotic MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy, template mapping biopsy and transrectal MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy. Consensus recommendations were developed using the Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There is limited high level evidence available on the subject of MRI-guided prostate biopsy. MRI guidance with or without TRUS fusion can lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies, help identify high-risk (Gleason ≥ 3 + 4) cancers that might have been missed on standard TRUS biopsy and identify cancers in the anterior prostate. There is no apparent significant difference between MRI biopsy platforms. Template mapping biopsy is perhaps the most accurate method of assessing volume and grade of tumor but is accompanied by higher incidence of side effects compared to TRUS biopsy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsies are feasible and better than traditional ultrasound-guided biopsies for detecting high-risk prostate cancer and anterior lesions. Judicious use of MRI-guided biopsy could enhance diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer while limiting diagnosis of insignificant cancer.",1
375,Surgical spectral imaging,"Recent technological developments have resulted in the availability of miniaturised spectral imaging sensors capable of operating in the multi- (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) regimes. Simultaneous advances in image-processing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting biological information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to benefit from this, as spectrally-resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance information during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imaging (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013-2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simulation, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imaging datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical translation.",0
376,Prophylactic intra-abdominal drainage following colorectal anastomoses. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background:
        
      
      Clinically evident Anastomotic Leakage (AL) remains one of the most feared complications after colorectal resections with primary anastomosis. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether Prophylactic Drainage (PD) after colorectal anastomoses confers any advantage in the prevention and management of AL.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE databases for randomized studies comparing clinical outcomes of patients with Drained (D) or Undrained (UD) colorectal anastomoses performed for any cause.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four randomized controlled trials comparing D and UD patients undergoing colorectal resections with primary anastomosis were included for quantitative synthesis. In total, 1120 patients were allocated to group D (n = 566) or group UD (n = 554). The clinical AL rate was 8.5% in the D group and 7.6% in the UD group, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.57). Rates of radiological AL (D: 4.2% versus UD: 5.6%; P = 0.42), mortality (D: 3.6% versus UD: 4.4%; P = 0.63), overall morbidity (D: 16.6% versus UD: 18.6%, P = 0.38), wound infection (D: 5.4% versus UD: 5.3%, P = 0.95), pelvic sepsis (D: 9.7% versus UD: 10.5%, P = 0.75), postoperative bowel obstruction (D: 9.9% versus UD: 6.9%, P = 0.07), and reintervention for abdominal complication (D: 9.1% versus UD: 7.9%, P = 0.48) were equivalent between the two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the value of PD following colorectal anastomoses does not support the routine use of prophylactic drains.",2
377,Polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel rectal spacers for prostate brachytherapy: a systematic review with a focus on technique,"Introduction:
        
      
      Radiation dose to the rectum in prostate brachytherapy (PBT) can be reduced by the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel spacers. This reduces the rate of rectal toxicity and allows dose escalation to the prostate. Our objectives were to provide an overview of technique for injection of a PEG hydrogel spacer, reduction in rectal dosimetry, gastrointestinal toxicity and potential complications.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We systematically reviewed the role of PEG hydrogel spacers in PBT using the Cochrane and PRISMA methodology for all English-language articles from January 2013 to December 2019. Data was extracted for type of radiotherapy, number of patients, type of PEG-hydrogel used, mean prostate-rectum separation, rectal dosimetry, acute and late GI toxicity, procedure-related complications and the technique used for hydrogel insertion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine studies (671 patients and 537 controls) met our inclusion criteria. Of these 4 used DuraSeal® and 5 used SpaceOAR®. The rectal spacing achieved varied between 7.7-16 mm. Failure of hydrogel insertion was seen only in 12 patients, mostly related to failure of hydrodissection in patients undergoing salvage PBT. Where reported, the rectal D2 cc was reduced by between 21.6 and 52.6% and the median rectal V75% cc was reduced by between 91.8-100%. Acute GI complications were mostly limited to grade 1 or 2 toxicity (n = 153, 33.7%) with low levels of grade 3 or 4 toxicity (n = 1, 0.22%). Procedure-related complications were limited to tenesmus (0.14%), rectal discomfort (1.19%), and bacterial prostatitis (0.44%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PEG hydrogel spacers are safe to insert. Gel insertion is easy, fast and has a low rate of failure. These studies convincingly demonstrate a significant reduction in rectal dosimetry. Although the results of spacers in reducing rectal toxicity is promising, these need to be confirmed in prospective randomised trial.",2
378,Digital interventions for subjective and objective social isolation among individuals with mental health conditions: a scoping review,"Background:
        
      
      Social isolation encompasses subjective and objective concepts. Both are associated with negative health consequences and are more prevalent among people with mental health problems than among the general population. To alleviate social isolation, digital interventions have potential as accessible alternatives or adjuncts to face-to-face interventions. This scoping review aimed to describe the types of digital interventions evaluated for feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in alleviating social isolation among individuals with mental health problems, and to present an overview of the quantitative evidence yielded to inform future intervention design.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We searched five electronic databases for quantitative and mixed methods studies published between January 2000 and July 2020. Studies were included if they evaluated digital interventions for individuals with mental health conditions, had subjective and/or objective social isolation as their primary outcome, or as one of their outcomes if no primary outcome was specified. Feasibility studies were included if feasibility outcomes were the primary outcomes and social isolation was among their secondary outcomes. A narrative synthesis was conducted to present our findings. The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (doi: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CNX8A ).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-two studies were included for our review: 16 feasibility studies, seven single-group studies and nine effectiveness trials. There was great variation in the interventions, study designs and sample populations. Interventions included web-based programmes, phone-based programmes, blended interventions, socially assistive robots and virtual reality interventions. Many were feasibility studies, or otherwise not fully powered to detect an effect if one were present, thus preventing clear conclusions about clinical effectiveness. Satisfactory feasibility outcomes indicated potential for future trials to assess these interventions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our scoping review identified a range of digital approaches utilized to alleviate social isolation among individuals with mental health disorders. Conclusions regarding clinical effectiveness cannot be reached due to variability of approaches and lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials. To make clear recommendations for digital social isolation interventions, future research needs to be based on rigorous methods and larger samples. Future studies should also focus on utilizing theory-driven approaches and improving existing approaches to advance the field.",1
379,The novel arthroscopic subscapular quadriceps tendon-bone sling procedure provides increased stability in shoulder cadavers with severe glenoid bone loss,"Purpose:
        
      
      Treatment of anterior glenoid bone loss in patients with recurrent anterior shoulder instability is a challenge. The subscapular sling method with quadriceps tendon bone (QTB) graft is a modification of the subscapular sling with a semitendinosus (ST) graft. The aim of the study was to test the biomechanical stability of the QTB sling procedure in human shoulder cadavers with severe anterior glenoid bone loss.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Fourteen cadaveric shoulders were tested with a force-moment-guided robot in three conditions: physiologically intact, anterior glenoid bone resection, and the subscapular sling procedure with a QTB graft. Joint stability was measured in anterior, anterior inferior and inferior directions in four glenohumeral joint positions: 0° and 60° of glenohumeral abduction, with each at 0° and 60° of external rotation. Maximum external rotation was measured at 0° and 60° glenohumeral abduction. Computer tomography scans were obtained preoperatively to plan the glenoid bone resection, as well as postoperatively to calculate the proportion of the glenoid bone actually resected.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significantly decreased translations were observed in the shoulders with the QTB sling compared to the intact joint and the glenoid bone loss model. No significant differences in maximum external rotation were observed between the three different conditions.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This biomechanical study revealed a significant stabilizing effect of the arthroscopic subscapular QTB graft sling procedure in human shoulder cadavers without compromising external rotation. Clinical trials may reveal the usefulness of this experimental method.",8
380,SEND: a system for electronic notification and documentation of vital sign observations,"Background:
        
      
      Recognising the limitations of a paper-based approach to documenting vital sign observations and responding to national clinical guidelines, we have explored the use of an electronic solution that could improve the quality and safety of patient care. We have developed a system for recording vital sign observations at the bedside, automatically calculating an Early Warning Score, and saving data such that it is accessible to all relevant clinicians within a hospital trust. We have studied current clinical practice of using paper observation charts, and attempted to streamline the process. We describe our user-focussed design process, and present the key design decisions prior to describing the system in greater detail.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The system has been deployed in three pilot clinical areas over a period of 9 months. During this time, vital sign observations were recorded electronically using our system. Analysis of the number of observations recorded (21,316 observations) and the number of active users (111 users) confirmed that the system is being used for routine clinical observations. Feedback from clinical end-users was collected to assess user acceptance of the system. This resulted in a System Usability Scale score of 77.8, indicating high user acceptability.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our system has been successfully piloted, and is in the process of full implementation throughout adult inpatient clinical areas in the Oxford University Hospitals. Whilst our results demonstrate qualitative acceptance of the system, its quantitative effect on clinical care is yet to be evaluated.",0
381,"Endoscope Holders in Cranial Neurosurgery: Part I-Technology, Trends, and Implications","Objective:
        
      
      Cranial neuroendoscopy is becoming increasingly popular. Endoscopes may be used free-hand or with endoscope holders (EH). The aim of this paper is to summarize the evolution of EH and attempt an overview of currently available devices, features, and usage, identifying weaknesses and focusing on feasibility.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted on Pubmed, OvidSP, Ebsco, and Google Scholar. Targeted search through cross-references was also implemented, followed by personal contacts, interviews, company websites, and operating manuals. A pilot survey was performed to acquire an impression of the current state of usage. This was conducted by approaching surgeons from several countries via e-mail and online through a neurosurgical exchange forum. A more extensive survey will follow as Part II.
    


          Results:
        
      
      EH may be divided into manual and pneumatic. The use of micromanipulators is sometimes implemented. Different characteristics have been described, such as pneumatic, mechanical, friction, micromanipulator, robotic, hybrid, air-locking, and voice-control. Twenty eight surgeons responded. The majority (75%) do not routinely use EH. The rest use EH mainly for intraventricular rather than skull base procedures. Nearly all surgeons (96%) stated using a second surgeon regularly. Reported weaknesses included crude movements, downward drift, loss of depth perception, lack of flexibility, iatrogenic injury, cost, and bulky construction.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although EH have a role in neuroendoscopy, their use seems to be limited and their features regarded as suboptimal. There are no clear indications regarding the procedures that should be performed using EH. Many factors affect the implication of EH, including safety, type of surgery, surgeon's preference, and mechanical properties.",1
382,Comparison of Exeter stem offset size for total hip arthroplasty between males and females: A retrospective series of 780 hips,"Background:
        
      
      Many orthopaedic surgeons use a 'standard' stem offset length, typically 37.5 mm and 44 mm for females and males respectively, in total hip arthroplasty. With increasingly personalized surgery, 'standard' one-size-fits-all stem lengths may be outdated. This study aims to test whether pre-operative templating affects stem length choice and whether 'standard' stem sizes are therefore outdated.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a retrospective chart review of all total hip arthroplasty patients using Stryker's Exeter cemented femoral hip system in our centre between 2016 and 2020. Demographic and surgical data were collected. Data from surgeons who templated pre-operatively were compared to data from those who did not.
    


          Results:
        
      
      780 patients were included (309 male, 471 female), average age 71.4 years (range 23-96). We found a significant difference between male and female offset lengths; more males had an offset length of 44 mm and more females had an offset length of 37.5 mm (p = 0.004). Among surgeons who did not template pre-operatively, 20.6% of female patients and 10.3% of male patients had other 'non-standard' offset lengths. Among surgeons who did template pre-operatively, the proportion of both female and male patients who had other 'non-standard' offset lengths was significantly higher (43.1% and 23.4%, respectively p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The difference between templating and non-templating surgeons' stem choice revealed significant individual variability between males and females. 'Standard' offset lengths for males and females were still used in the majority of our cohort. However, with the emergence of mainstream robotic arthroplasty, we feel that pre-operative templating has become a minimum standard.",5
383,Global reward state affects learning and activity in raphe nucleus and anterior insula in monkeys,"People and other animals learn the values of choices by observing the contingencies between them and their outcomes. However, decisions are not guided by choice-linked reward associations alone; macaques also maintain a memory of the general, average reward rate - the global reward state - in an environment. Remarkably, global reward state affects the way that each choice outcome is valued and influences future decisions so that the impact of both choice success and failure is different in rich and poor environments. Successful choices are more likely to be repeated but this is especially the case in rich environments. Unsuccessful choices are more likely to be abandoned but this is especially likely in poor environments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed two distinct patterns of activity, one in anterior insula and one in the dorsal raphe nucleus, that track global reward state as well as specific outcome events.",2
384,Deep Learning-Based Algorithms in Screening of Diabetic Retinopathy: A Systematic Review of Diagnostic Performance,"Topic:
        
      
      Diagnostic performance of deep learning-based algorithms in screening patients with diabetes for diabetic retinopathy (DR). The algorithms were compared with the current gold standard of classification by human specialists.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      Because DR is a common cause of visual impairment, screening is indicated to avoid irreversible vision loss. Automated DR classification using deep learning may be a suitable new screening tool that could improve diagnostic performance and reduce manpower.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For this systematic review, we aimed to identify studies that incorporated the use of deep learning in classifying full-scale DR in retinal fundus images of patients with diabetes. The studies had to provide a DR grading scale, a human grader as a reference standard, and a deep learning performance score. A systematic search on April 5, 2018, through MEDLINE and Embase yielded 304 publications. To identify potentially missed publications, the reference lists of the final included studies were manually screened, yielding no additional publications. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used for risk of bias and applicability assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      By using objective selection, we included 11 diagnostic accuracy studies that validated the performance of their deep learning method using a new group of patients or retrospective datasets. Eight studies reported sensitivity and specificity of 80.28% to 100.0% and 84.0% to 99.0%, respectively. Two studies report accuracies of 78.7% and 81.0%. One study provides an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.955. In addition to diagnostic performance, one study also reported on patient satisfaction, showing that 78% of patients preferred an automated deep learning model over manual human grading.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Advantages of implementing deep learning-based algorithms in DR screening include reduction in manpower, cost of screening, and issues relating to intragrader and intergrader variability. However, limitations that may hinder such an implementation particularly revolve around ethical concerns regarding lack of trust in the diagnostic accuracy of computers. Considering both strengths and limitations, as well as the high performance of deep learning-based algorithms, automated DR classification using deep learning could be feasible in a real-world screening scenario.",0
385,A two-centre experience of transanal total mesorectal excision,"Aim:
        
      
      Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) offers a promising alternative to the standard surgical abdominopelvic approach for rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to report a two-centre experience of this technique, focusing on the short-term and oncological outcome.
    


          Method:
        
      
      From May 2013 to May 2015, 40 selected patients with histologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma underwent TaTME in two institutions and were prospectively entered on an online international registry.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty patients (80% men, mean body mass index 27.4 kg/m2 ) requiring TME underwent TaTME. Procedures included low anterior resection (n = 31), abdominoperineal excision (n = 7) and proctocolectomy (n = 2). A minimally invasive approach was attempted in all cases, with three conversions. The mean operation time was 368 min and 16 patients (40%) had a synchronous abdominal and transanal approach. There was no mortality and 16 postoperative complications occurred, of which 68.8% were minor. The median length of stay was 7.5 (3-92) days. A complete or near-complete TME specimen was delivered in 39 (97.5%) cases with a mean number of 20 lymph nodes harvested. R0 resection was achieved in 38 (95%) patients. After a median follow-up of 10.7 months, there were no local recurrences and six (15%) patients had developed distant metastases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      TaTME appears to be feasible, safe and reproducible, without compromising the oncological principles of rectal cancer surgery. It is an attractive option for patients for whom laparoscopy is likely to be particularly difficult. These encouraging results should encourage larger studies with assessment of long-term function and the oncological outcome.",3
386,Surgical Advances in Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer in children and, unfortunately, is associated with poor survival rates. OS most commonly arises around the knee joint, and was traditionally treated with amputation until surgeons began to favour limb-preserving surgery in the 1990s. Whilst improving functional outcomes, this was not without problems, such as implant failure and limb length discrepancies. OS can also arise in areas such as the pelvis, spine, head, and neck, which creates additional technical difficulty given the anatomical complexity of the areas. We reviewed the literature and summarised the recent advances in OS surgery. Improvements have been made in many areas; developments in pre-operative imaging technology have allowed improved planning, whilst the ongoing development of intraoperative imaging techniques, such as fluorescent dyes, offer the possibility of improved surgical margins. Technological developments, such as computer navigation, patient specific instruments, and improved implant design similarly provide the opportunity to improve patient outcomes. Going forward, there are a number of promising avenues currently being pursued, such as targeted fluorescent dyes, robotics, and augmented reality, which bring the prospect of improving these outcomes further.",1
387,Robotic Semi-Automated Transcranial Doppler Assessment of Cerebrovascular Autoregulation in Post-Concussion Syndrome: Methodological Considerations,"Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) refers to a constellation of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite its incidence and impact, the underlying mechanisms of PCS are unclear. We hypothesized that impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a contributor. In this article, we present our protocol for non-invasively assessing CA in patients with TBI and PCS in a real-world clinical setting. A prospective, observational study was integrated into outpatient clinics at a tertiary neurosurgical center. Data points included: demographics, symptom profile (Post-Concussion Symptom Scale [PCSS]) and neuropsychological assessment (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated-Battery [CANTAB]). Cerebrovascular metrics (nMxa co-efficient and the transient hyperaemic-response ratio [THRR]) were collected using transcranial Doppler (TCD), finger plethysmography, and bespoke software (ICM+). Twelve participants were initially recruited but 2 were excluded after unsuccessful insonation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA); 10 participants (5 patients with TBI, 5 healthy controls) were included in the analysis (median age 26.5 years, male to female ratio: 7:3). Median PCSS scores were 6/126 for the TBI patient sub-groups. Median CANTAB percentiles were 78 (healthy controls) and 25 (TBI). nMxa was calculated for 90% of included patients, whereas THRR was calculated for 50%. Median study time was 127.5 min and feedback (n = 6) highlighted the perceived acceptability of the study. This pilot study has demonstrated a reproducible assessment of PCS and CA metrics (non-invasively) in a real-world setting. This protocol is feasible and is acceptable to participants. By scaling this methodology, we hope to test whether CA changes are correlated with symptomatic PCS in patients post-TBI.",0
388,"Telemedicine and Telehealth in Urology: Uptake, Impact and Barriers to Clinical Adoption","Telemedicine has great potential in urology as a strong medium for providing patients with continuous high-quality urological care despite the hurdles involved in its implementation. Both clinicians and patients are crucial factors in determining the success of tele-consults in terms of simplicity of use and overall satisfaction. For it to be successfully incorporated into routine urological practice, rigorous training and evidence-based recommendations are lacking. If these issues are addressed, they can provide a significant impetus for future tele-consults in urology and their successful deployment, even beyond the pandemic, to assure safer and more environment-friendly patient management.",0
389,European Association of Urology Guidelines on Male Sexual and Reproductive Health: 2021 Update on Male Infertility,"Context:
        
      
      The European Association of Urology (EAU) has updated its guidelines on sexual and reproductive health for 2021.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To present a summary of the 2021 version of the EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health, including advances and areas of controversy in male infertility.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      The panel performed a comprehensive literature review of novel data up to January 2021. The guidelines were updated and a strength rating for each recommendation was included that was based either on a systematic review of the literature or consensus opinion from the expert panel, where applicable.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      The male partner in infertile couples should undergo a comprehensive urological assessment to identify and treat any modifiable risk factors causing fertility impairment. Infertile men are at a higher risk of harbouring and developing other diseases including malignancy and cardiovascular disease and should be screened for potential modifiable risk factors, such as hypogonadism. Sperm DNA fragmentation testing has emerged as a novel biomarker that can identify infertile men and provide information on the outcomes from assisted reproductive techniques. The role of hormone stimulation therapy in hypergonadotropic hypogonadal or eugonadal patients is controversial and is not recommended outside of clinical trials. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to support the widespread use of other empirical treatments and surgical interventions in clinical practice (such as antioxidants and surgical sperm retrieval in men without azoospermia). There is low-quality evidence to support the routine use of testicular fine-needle mapping as an alternative diagnostic and predictive tool before testicular sperm extraction (TESE) in men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), and either conventional or microdissection TESE remains the surgical modality of choice for men with NOA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      All infertile men should undergo a comprehensive urological assessment to identify and treat any modifiable risk factors. Increasing data indicate that infertile men are at higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and of developing cancers and should be screened and counselled accordingly. There is low-quality evidence supporting the use of empirical treatments and interventions currently used in clinical practice; the efficacy of these therapies needs to be validated in large-scale randomised controlled trials.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Approximately 50% of infertility will be due to problems with the male partner. Therefore, all infertile men should be assessed by a specialist with the expertise to not only help optimise their fertility but also because they are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and cancer long term and therefore require appropriate counselling and management. There are many treatments and interventions for male infertility that have not been validated in high-quality studies and caution should be applied to their use in routine clinical practice.",0
390,"""Contemplating the Next Maneuver"": Functional Neuroimaging Reveals Intraoperative Decision-making Strategies","Objective:
        
      
      To investigate differences in the quality, confidence, and consistency of intraoperative surgical decision making (DM) and using functional neuroimaging expose decision systems that operators use.
    


          Summary background data:
        
      
      Novices are hypothesized to use conscious analysis (effortful DM) leading to activation across the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas experts are expected to use unconscious automation (habitual DM) in which decisions are recognition-primed and prefrontal cortex independent.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 22 subjects (10 medical student novices, 7 residents, and 5 attendings) reviewed simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos, determined the next safest operative maneuver upon video termination (10 s), and reported decision confidence. Video paradigms either declared (""primed"") or withheld (""unprimed"") the next operative maneuver. Simultaneously, changes in cortical oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin inferring prefrontal activation were recorded using Optical Topography. Decision confidence, consistency (primed vs unprimed), and quality (script concordance) were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Attendings and residents were significantly more certain (P < 0.001), and decision quality was superior (script concordance: attendings = 90%, residents = 78.3%, and novices = 53.3%). Decision consistency was significantly superior in experts (P < 0.001) and residents (P < 0.05) than novices (P = 0.183). During unprimed DM, novices showed significant activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas this activation pattern was not observed among residents and attendings. During primed DM, significant activation was not observed in any group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Expert DM is characterized by improved quality, consistency, and confidence. The findings imply attendings use a habitual decision system, whereas novices use an effortful approach under uncertainty. In the presence of operative cues (primes), novices disengage the prefrontal cortex and seem to accept the observed operative decision as correct.",4
391,Medical Device Development for Children and Young People-Reviewing the Challenges and Opportunities,"Development of specific medical devices (MDs) is required to meet the healthcare needs of children and young people (CYP). In this context, MD development should address changes in growth and psychosocial maturation, physiology, and pathophysiology, and avoid inappropriate repurposing of adult technologies. Underpinning the development of MD for CYP is the need to ensure MD safety and effectiveness through pediatric MD-specific regulations. Contrary to current perceptions of limited market potential, the global pediatric healthcare market is expected to generate around USD 15,984 million by 2025. There are 1.8 billion young people in the world today; 40% of the global population is under 24, creating significant future healthcare market opportunities. This review highlights a number of technology areas that have led to successful pediatric MD, including 3D printing, advanced materials, drug delivery, and diagnostic imaging. To ensure the targeted development of MD for CYP, collaboration across multiple professional disciplines is required, facilitated by a platform to foster collaboration and drive innovation. The European Pediatric Translational Research Infrastructure (EPTRI) will be established as the European platform to support collaboration, including the life sciences industrial sector, to identify unmet needs in child health and support the development, adoption, and commercialization of pediatric MDs.",0
392,Gold nanorod reshaping in vitro and in vivo using a continuous wave laser,"Gold nanorods (GNRs) are increasingly being investigated for cancer theranostics as they possess features which lend themselves in equal measures as contrast agents and catalysts for photothermal therapy. Their optical absorption spectral peak wavelength is determined by their size and shape. Photothermal therapy using GNRs is typically established using near infrared light as this allows sufficient penetration into the tumour matrix. Continuous wave (CW) lasers are the most commonly applied source of near infrared irradiation on GNRs for tumour photothermal therapy. It is perceived that large tumours may require fractionated or prolonged irradiation. However the true efficacy of repeated or protracted CW irradiation on tumour sites using the original sample of GNRs remains unclear. In this study spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy are used to demonstrate that GNRs reshape both in vitro and in vivo after CW irradiation, which reduces their absorption efficiency. These changes were sustained throughout and beyond the initial period of irradiation, resulting from a spectral blue-shift and a considerable diminution in the absorption peak of GNRs. Solid subcutaneous tumours in immunodeficient BALB/c mice were subjected to GNRs and analysed with electron microscopy pre- and post-CW laser irradiation. This phenomenon of thermally induced GNR reshaping can occur at relatively low bulk temperatures, well below the bulk melting point of gold. Photoacoustic monitoring of GNR reshaping is also evaluated as a potential clinical aid to determine GNR absorption and reshaping during photothermal therapy. Aggregation of particles was coincidentally observed following CW irradiation, which would further diminish the subsequent optical absorption capacity of irradiated GNRs. It is thus established that sequential or prolonged applications of CW laser will not confer any additional photothermal effect on tumours due to significant attenuations in the peak optical absorption properties of GNRs following primary laser irradiation.",0
393,WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting,"Background:
        
      
      Despite the current therapeutic options for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, surgery is still frequently required in the emergency setting, although the number of cases performed seems to have decreased in recent years. The World Society of Emergency Surgery decided to debate in a consensus conference of experts, the main pertinent issues around the management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergent situation, with the need to provide focused guidelines for acute care and emergency surgeons.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A group of experienced surgeons and gastroenterologists were nominated to develop the topics assigned and answer the questions addressed by the Steering Committee of the project. Each expert followed a precise analysis and grading of the studies selected for review. Statements and recommendations were discussed and voted at the Consensus Conference of the 6th World Society of Emergency Surgery held in Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in June 2019.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Complicated inflammatory bowel disease requires a multidisciplinary approach because of the complexity of this patient group and disease spectrum in the emergency setting, with the aim of obtaining safe surgery with good functional outcomes and a decreasing stoma rate where appropriate.",3
394,Pancreatic Enucleation Patients Share the Same Quality of Life as the General Population at Long-Term Follow-Up: A Propensity-Score Matched Analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess short- and long-term outcomes including quality of life (QoL) following PE.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Pancreatic enucleation (PE) is deemed to preserve both the endocrine and the exocrine function while ensuring radicality. However, to assess whether this reflects an actual benefit perceived by patients, QoL has to be considered.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from all consecutive patients undergoing PE from January 2010 to December 2019 were retrospectively analysed. Surgical outcomes were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and EORTC-C30 and the EORTC-Pan26 were administered as a cross-sectional assessment of QoL. A control group consisting of healthy individuals from the general population was obtained and matched using the propensity score matching method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighty-one patients underwent PE using the open (59.3%), laparoscopic (27.2%) or robot-assisted (13.5%) approach. Sixty-five (80.2%) patients exhibited functioning/non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNET) at final pathology.Surgical morbidity and complications of a Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3 were 48.1% and 16.0%, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 0%. Postoperative pancreatic fistula, post-pancreatectomy haemorrhage, and delayed gastric emptying rates were 21.0%, 9.9%, and 4.9%, respectively.Patients returned the questionnaires after a median of 74.2 months from the index surgery. Postoperative new onset of diabetes mellitus (NODM) was observed in five subjects (7.1%), with age being an independent predictor. Seven patients (10.0%) developed postoperative exocrine insufficiency. At the analysis of QoL, all function and symptom scales were comparable between the two groups, except for two of the EORTC-Pan 26 symptom scales, (""worries for the future"" and ""body image"", p < 0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite being associated with significant postoperative morbidity, PE provides excellent long-term outcomes. The risk of NODM is low and related to patient age, with QoL being comparable to the general population. Such information should drive surgeons to pursue PE whenever properly indicated.",2
395,C-reactive protein can predict anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Anastomotic leakage (AL) is one of the most significant complications after colorectal surgery, affecting length of stay, patient morbidity, mortality, and long-term oncological outcome. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level rises in infective and inflammatory states. Elevated CRP has been shown to be associated with anastomotic leak.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Perform a meta-analysis of current CRP data in AL after colorectal surgery.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL databases STUDY SELECTION: Comparative studies studying serum CRP levels in adult patients with and without AL after colorectal surgery.
    


          Intervention(s):
        
      
      Elective and emergency open, laparoscopic or robotic colorectal excisions for cancer and benign pathology.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Mean serum CRP measurements between post-operative days (POD) 1 through 7 in patients with and without AL. Perform ROC analysis to determine cut-off CRP values to indicate AL.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-three studies with 6647 patients (482 AL). Pooled mean time to diagnosis of AL was 7.70 days. AL associated with higher CRP on POD1 (mean difference (MD) 15.19, 95% CI 5.88-24.50, p = 0.001), POD2 (MD 51.98, 05% CI 37.36-66.60, p < 0.00001), POD3 (MD 96.92, 95% CI 67.96-125.89, p < 0.00001), POD4 (MD 93.15, 95% CI 69.47-116.84, p < 0.00001), POD5 (MD 112.10, 95% CI 89.74-134.45, p < 0.00001), POD6 (MD 98.38, 95% CI 80.29-116.46, p < 0.00001), and POD7 (MD 106.41, 95% CI 75.48-137.35, p < 0.00001) compared with no AL. ROC analysis identified a cut-off CRP of 148 mg/l on POD3 with sensitivity and specificity of 95%. On POD4 through POD7, cut-off levels were 123 mg/l, 115 mg/l, 105 mg/l, and 96 mg/l, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity of 100%.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Study heterogeneity, some characteristics unreported, no RCT CONCLUSIONS: AL is associated with higher CRP levels on each post-operative day compared to no AL after colorectal surgery. The cut-off CRP values can be used to predict AL to expedite investigation and treatment.",5
396,Benchmarking of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy: European multicentre study,"Background:
        
      
      Benchmarking is the process to used assess the best achievable results and compare outcomes with that standard. This study aimed to assess best achievable outcomes in minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (MIDPS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective study included consecutive patients undergoing MIDPS for any indication, between 2003 and 2019, in 31 European centres. Benchmarks of the main clinical outcomes were calculated according to the Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC™) method. After identifying independent risk factors for severe morbidity and conversion, risk-adjusted ABCs were calculated for each subgroup of patients at risk.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1595 patients were included. The ABC was 2.5 per cent for conversion and 8.4 per cent for severe morbidity. ABC values were 160 min for duration of operation time, 8.3 per cent for POPF, 1.8 per cent for reoperation, and 0 per cent for mortality. Multivariable analysis showed that conversion was associated with male sex (OR 1.48), BMI exceeding 30 kg/m2 (OR 2.42), multivisceral resection (OR 3.04), and laparoscopy (OR 2.24). Increased risk of severe morbidity was associated with ASA fitness grade above II (OR 1.60), multivisceral resection (OR 1.88), and robotic approach (OR 1.87).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The benchmark values obtained using the ABC method represent optimal outcomes from best achievable care, including low complication rates and zero mortality. These benchmarks should be used to set standards to improve patient outcomes.",9
397,Unclonable human-invisible machine vision markers leveraging the omnidirectional chiral Bragg diffraction of cholesteric spherical reflectors,"The seemingly simple step of molding a cholesteric liquid crystal into spherical shape, yielding a Cholesteric Spherical Reflector (CSR), has profound optical consequences that open a range of opportunities for potentially transformative technologies. The chiral Bragg diffraction resulting from the helical self-assembly of cholesterics becomes omnidirectional in CSRs. This turns them into selective retroreflectors that are exceptionally easy to distinguish-regardless of background-by simple and low-cost machine vision, while at the same time they can be made largely imperceptible to human vision. This allows them to be distributed in human-populated environments, laid out in the form of QR-code-like markers that help robots and Augmented Reality (AR) devices to operate reliably, and to identify items in their surroundings. At the scale of individual CSRs, unpredictable features within each marker turn them into Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), of great value for secure authentication. Via the machines reading them, CSR markers can thus act as trustworthy yet unobtrusive links between the physical world (buildings, vehicles, packaging,…) and its digital twin computer representation. This opens opportunities to address pressing challenges in logistics and supply chain management, recycling and the circular economy, sustainable construction of the built environment, and many other fields of individual, societal and commercial importance.",0
398,SEEG assistant: a 3DSlicer extension to support epilepsy surgery,"Background:
        
      
      In the evaluation of Stereo-Electroencephalography (SEEG) signals, the physicist's workflow involves several operations, including determining the position of individual electrode contacts in terms of both relationship to grey or white matter and location in specific brain regions. These operations are (i) generally carried out manually by experts with limited computer support, (ii) hugely time consuming, and (iii) often inaccurate, incomplete, and prone to errors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this paper we present SEEG Assistant, a set of tools integrated in a single 3DSlicer extension, which aims to assist neurosurgeons in the analysis of post-implant structural data and hence aid the neurophysiologist in the interpretation of SEEG data. SEEG Assistant consists of (i) a module to localize the electrode contact positions using imaging data from a thresholded post-implant CT, (ii) a module to determine the most probable cerebral location of the recorded activity, and (iii) a module to compute the Grey Matter Proximity Index, i.e. the distance of each contact from the cerebral cortex, in order to discriminate between white and grey matter location of contacts. Finally, exploiting 3DSlicer capabilities, SEEG Assistant offers a Graphical User Interface that simplifies the interaction between the user and the tools. SEEG Assistant has been tested on 40 patients segmenting 555 electrodes, and it has been used to identify the neuroanatomical loci and to compute the distance to the nearest cerebral cortex for 9626 contacts. We also performed manual segmentation and compared the results between the proposed tool and gold-standard clinical practice. As a result, the use of SEEG Assistant decreases the post implant processing time by more than 2 orders of magnitude, improves the quality of results and decreases, if not eliminates, errors in post implant processing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The SEEG Assistant Framework for the first time supports physicists by providing a set of open-source tools for post-implant processing of SEEG data. Furthermore, SEEG Assistant has been integrated into 3D Slicer, a software platform for the analysis and visualization of medical images, overcoming limitations of command-line tools.",0
399,Risk of conversion to open surgery during robotic and laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy and effect on outcomes: international propensity score-matched comparison study,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy (MIPD) is increasingly being performed because of perceived patient benefits. Whether conversion of MIPD to open pancreatoduodenectomy worsens outcome, and which risk factors are associated with conversion, is unclear.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a post hoc analysis of a European multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing MIPD (2012-2017) in ten medium-volume (10-19 MIPDs annually) and four high-volume (at least 20 MIPDs annually) centres. Propensity score matching (1 : 1) was used to compare outcomes of converted and non-converted MIPD procedures. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for conversion, with results presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals (c.i).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 65 of 709 MIPDs were converted (9.2 per cent) and the overall 30-day mortality rate was 3.8 per cent. Risk factors for conversion were tumour size larger than 40 mm (OR 2.7, 95 per cent c.i.1.0 to 6.8; P = 0.041), pancreatobiliary tumours (OR 2.2, 1.0 to 4.8; P = 0.039), age at least 75 years (OR 2.0, 1.0 to 4.1; P = 0.043), and laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (OR 5.2, 2.5 to 10.7; P < 0.001). Medium-volume centres had a higher risk of conversion than high-volume centres (15.2 versus 4.1 per cent, P < 0.001; OR 4.1, 2.3 to 7.4, P < 0.001). After propensity score matching (56 converted MIPDs and 56 completed MIPDs) including risk factors, rates of complications with a Clavien-Dindo grade of III or higher (32 versus 34 per cent; P = 0.841) and 30-day mortality (12 versus 6 per cent; P = 0.274) did not differ between converted and non-converted MIPDs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Risk factors for conversion during MIPD include age, large tumour size, tumour location, laparoscopic approach, and surgery in medium-volume centres. Although conversion during MIPD itself was not associated with worse outcomes, the outcome in these patients was poor in general which should be taken into account during patient selection for MIPD.",9
400,Understanding the role of the gut in undernutrition: what can technology tell us?,"Gut function remains largely underinvestigated in undernutrition, despite its critical role in essential nutrient digestion, absorption and assimilation. In areas of high enteropathogen burden, alterations in gut barrier function and subsequent inflammatory effects are observable but remain poorly characterised. Environmental enteropathy (EE)-a condition that affects both gut morphology and function and is characterised by blunted villi, inflammation and increased permeability-is thought to play a role in impaired linear growth (stunting) and severe acute malnutrition. However, the lack of tools to quantitatively characterise gut functional capacity has hampered both our understanding of gut pathogenesis in undernutrition and evaluation of gut-targeted therapies to accelerate nutritional recovery. Here we survey the technology landscape for potential solutions to improve assessment of gut function, focussing on devices that could be deployed at point-of-care in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We assess the potential for technological innovation to assess gut morphology, function, barrier integrity and immune response in undernutrition, and highlight the approaches that are currently most suitable for deployment and development. This article focuses on EE and undernutrition in LMICs, but many of these technologies may also become useful in monitoring of other gut pathologies.",1
401,"The Parkinsonian Subthalamic Network: Measures of Power, Linear, and Non-linear Synchronization and their Relationship to L-DOPA Treatment and OFF State Motor Severity","In this paper we investigated the dopaminergic modulation of neuronal interactions occurring in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during Parkinson's disease (PD). We utilized linear measures of local and long range synchrony such as power and coherence, as well as Detrended Fluctuation Analysis for Phase Synchrony (DFA-PS)- a recently developed non-linear method that computes the extent of long tailed autocorrelations present in the phase interactions between two coupled signals. Through analysis of local field potentials (LFPs) taken from the STN we seek to determine changes in the neurodynamics that may underpin the pathophysiology of PD in a group of 12 patients who had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation. We demonstrate up modulation of alpha-theta (5-12 Hz) band power in response to L-DOPA treatment, whilst low beta band power (15-20 Hz) band-power is suppressed. We also find evidence for significant local connectivity within the region surrounding STN although there was evidence for its modulation via administration of L-DOPA. Further to this we present evidence for a positive correlation between the phase ordering of bilateral STN interactions and the severity of bradykinetic and rigidity symptoms in PD. Although, the ability of non-linear measures to predict clinical state did not exceed standard measures such as beta power, these measures may help identify the connections which play a role in pathological dynamics.",0
402,Ileal Obstruction Secondary to Internal Hernia Under the External Iliac Artery: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Bowel obstruction is one of the most common causes of surgical admission. Most of these patients are managed with non-operative management, often resolving 24 to 48 hours after admission. If conservative management fails in patients with adhesional bowel obstruction, surgery is usually the only other option. Surgery often involves the division of adhesions and resection of the non-viable intestine. Occasionally, unexpected findings require quick but safe interventions, including discussions with other specialities. This report presents a patient who had previously undergone robotic radical cystectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy and ileal conduit formation. He was admitted with bowel obstruction and failed conservative management. During laparotomy, a loop of ileum had herniated under the right external iliac artery and was ischaemic necessitating resection-anastomosis. We discuss the management of this patient and the available literature regarding this rare presentation.",2
403,Systematic Review of Studies Reporting Positive Surgical Margins After Bladder Neck Sparing Radical Prostatectomy,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Bladder neck preservation (BNP) during radical prostatectomy (RP) has been proposed as a method to improve early recovery of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy. However, there is concern over a possible increase in the risk of positive surgical margins and prostate cancer recurrence rate. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported improved early recovery and overall long-term urinary continence without compromising oncologic control. The aim of our study was to perform a critical review of the literature to assess the impact on bladder neck and base margins after bladder neck sparing radical prostatectomy.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      We carried out a systematic review of the literature using Pubmed, Scopus and Cochrane library databases in May 2017 using medical subject headings and free-text protocol according to PRISMA guidelines. We used the following search terms: bladder neck preservation, prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy and surgical margins. Studies focusing on positive surgical margins (PSM) in bladder neck sparing RP pertinent to the objective of this review were included.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      Overall, we found 15 relevant studies reporting overall and site-specific positive surgical margins rate after bladder neck sparing radical prostatectomy. This included two RCTs, seven prospective comparative studies, two retrospective comparative studies and four case series. All studies were published between 1993 and 2015 with sample sizes ranging between 50 and 1067. Surgical approaches included open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The overall and base-specific PSM rates ranged between 7-36% and 0-16.3%, respectively. Mean base PSM was 4.9% in those patients where bladder neck sparing was performed, but only 1.85% in those without sparing. Bladder neck preservation during radical prostatectomy may increase base-positive margins. Further studies are needed to better investigate the impact of this technique on oncological outcomes. A future paradigm could include modification of intended approach to bladder neck dissection when anterior base lesions are identified on pre-operative MRI.",1
404,Treatment planning optimization with beam motion modeling for dynamic arc delivery of SBRT using Cyberknife with multileaf collimation,"Purpose:
        
      
      The use of dynamic arcs for delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on Cyberknife is investigated, with a view to improving treatment times. This study investigates the required modeling of robot and multileaf collimator (MLC) motion between control points in the trajectory and then uses this to develop an optimization method for treatment planning of a dynamic arc with Cyberknife. The resulting plans are compared in terms of dose-volume histograms and estimated treatment times with those produced by a conventional beam arrangement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Five SBRT patient cases (prostate A - conventional, prostate B - brachytherapy-type, lung, liver, and partial left breast) were retrospectively studied. A suitable arc trajectory with control points spaced at 5° was proposed and treatment plans were produced for typical clinical protocols. The optimization consisted of a fluence optimization, segmentation, and direct aperture optimization using a gradient descent method. Dose delivered by the moving MLC was either taken to be the dose delivered discretely at the control points or modeled using effective fluence delivered between control points. The accuracy of calculated dose was assessed by recalculating after optimization using five interpolated beams and 100 interpolated apertures between each optimization control point. The resulting plans were compared using dose-volume histograms and estimated treatment times with those for a conventional Cyberknife beam arrangement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      If optimization is performed based on discrete doses delivered at the arc control points, large differences of up to 40% of the prescribed dose are seen when recalculating with interpolation. When the effective fluence between control points is taken into account during optimization, dosimetric differences are <2% for most structures when the plans are recalculated using intermediate nodes, but there are differences of up to 15% peripherally. Treatment plan quality is comparable between the arc trajectory and conventional body path. All plans meet the relevant clinical goals, with the exception of specific structures which overlap with the planning target volume. Median estimated treatment time is 355 s (range 235-672 s) for arc delivery and 675 s (range 554-1025 s) for conventional delivery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The method of using effective fluence to model MLC motion between control points is sufficiently accurate to provide for accurate inverse planning of dynamic arcs with Cyberknife. The proposed arcing method produces treatment plans with comparable quality to the body path, with reduced estimated treatment delivery time.",0
405,Hospital volume and outcomes after radical prostatectomy: a national population-based study using patient-reported urinary continence and sexual function,"Background:
        
      
      Improvements in short-term outcomes have been reported for hospitals with higher radical prostatectomy (RP) volumes. However, the association with longer-term functional outcomes is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All patients diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer in the English NHS between 2014 and 2016 who underwent RP (N = 10,089) were mailed a survey ≥18 months after diagnosis. Differences in patient-reported urinary continence and sexual function (EPIC-26 on scale from 0 to 100) by hospital volume group (≤60, 61-100, 101-140, >140 RPs/year) were estimated using multilevel linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 7702 men (76.3%) responded. There were no statistically significant differences in urinary continence (p = 0.08) or sexual function scores with increasing volume group (p = 0.2). When modelled as a linear function, we found a non-significant increase of 0.70 (95% CI -0.41 to 1.80; p = 0.22) in urinary continence and a significant increase of 1.54 (0.62-2.45; p = 0.001) in sexual function scores for a 100-procedure increase in hospital volume, which did not meet the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference (10-12 points). The results were similar for robotic-assisted RP (5529 men [71.8%]).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results do not support further centralisation of RP services beyond levels in England where four in five hospitals perform >60 RPs/year.",2
406,Construct Validity of the Questionnaire Quality From the Patients Perspective Adapted for Surgical Prostate Cancer Patients,"Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are important to capture the patients' voice. No such measure is routinely used for evaluation after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to adapt the short version of the PREM questionnaire quality from the patients' perspective (QPP), and assess the construct validity of this version. Quality from the patients' perspective assesses 4 dimensions of quality of care. Involving discussion with user representatives, the QPP short version was adapted by adding 7 context-specific questions based on items from the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice. This short version was answered on smartphone or tablet by 265 patients. We used exploratory factor analysis to assess dimensionality. For comparison with previous publications of the QPP, the analysis was repeated after mean imputation of missing values. The factor analysis identified 7 factors among the 30 analyzed items included in the analysis, explaining 64.9% of the variance. After imputation of missing, 2 factors explained 48.6% of the variance. None of these analysis captured the 4 dimensions of the QPP.",0
407,Positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence following minimally-invasive radical prostatectomy - An analysis of outcomes from a UK tertiary referral centre,"Background:
        
      
      Positive surgical margins are a strong prognostic marker of disease outcome following radical prostatectomy, though prior evidence is largely from a PSA-screened population. We therefore aim to evaluate the biochemical recurrence in men with positive surgical margins (PSM) after minimally-invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) in a UK tertiary centre.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective study of men undergoing laparoscopic or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy between 2002 and 2014. Men with positive surgical margins (PSM) were identified and their biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate compared with men without PSM. The primary outcome measures were BCR rates and time to BCR. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for biochemical recurrence rate (BCR), accounting for potential confounders.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five hundred ninety-two men were included for analysis. Pre-operative D'Amico risk stratification showed 37.5%, 53.3% and 9.3% of patients in the low, intermediate and high-risk groups, respectively. On final pathological analysis, the proportion of patients with local staging pT2, pT3a and pT3b was 68.8%, 25.2% and 6.1% respectively. Overall positive margin rate was 30.6%. On multivariate analysis, the only pre-operative factor associated with PSM was age >65years. Patients with PSM were more likely to have higher tumour volume and more advanced pathological local stage. The BCR rate was 10.7% in margin-positive patients and 5.1% in margin-negative patients, at median 4.4-year follow-up. Upon multivariate analysis, high pre-operative PSA and high Gleason group were the only significant predictors of BCR (P<0.05).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In comparison to patients with negative surgical margins, those with PSM do not translate into worse medium-term oncological outcomes in the majority of cases amongst our cohort. We found that high pre-operative PSA and high Gleason group were the only significant predictors of BCR.",2
408,Explainability of deep neural networks for MRI analysis of brain tumors,"Purpose:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence (AI), in particular deep neural networks, has achieved remarkable results for medical image analysis in several applications. Yet the lack of explainability of deep neural models is considered the principal restriction before applying these methods in clinical practice.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this study, we propose a NeuroXAI framework for explainable AI of deep learning networks to increase the trust of medical experts. NeuroXAI implements seven state-of-the-art explanation methods providing visualization maps to help make deep learning models transparent.
    


          Results:
        
      
      NeuroXAI has been applied to two applications of the most widely investigated problems in brain imaging analysis, i.e., image classification and segmentation using magnetic resonance (MR) modality. Visual attention maps of multiple XAI methods have been generated and compared for both applications. Another experiment demonstrated that NeuroXAI can provide information flow visualization on internal layers of a segmentation CNN.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Due to its open architecture, ease of implementation, and scalability to new XAI methods, NeuroXAI could be utilized to assist radiologists and medical professionals in the detection and diagnosis of brain tumors in the clinical routine of cancer patients. The code of NeuroXAI is publicly accessible at https://github.com/razeineldin/NeuroXAI .",0
409,Artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer liver metastases,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide, with approximately 50% of patients developing colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) during the follow-up period. Management of CRLM is best achieved via a multidisciplinary approach and the diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making process is complex. In order to optimize patients' survival and quality of life, there are several unsolved challenges which must be overcome. These primarily include a timely diagnosis and the identification of reliable prognostic factors. Furthermore, to allow optimal treatment options, a precision-medicine, personalized approach is required. The widespread digitalization of healthcare generates a vast amount of data and together with accessible high-performance computing, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be applied. By increasing diagnostic accuracy, reducing timings and costs, the application of AI could help mitigate the current shortcomings in CRLM management. In this review we explore the available evidence of the possible role of AI in all phases of the CRLM natural history. Radiomics analysis and convolutional neural networks (CNN) which combine computed tomography (CT) images with clinical data have been developed to predict CRLM development in CRC patients. AI models have also proven themselves to perform similarly or better than expert radiologists in detecting CRLM on CT and magnetic resonance scans or identifying them from the noninvasive analysis of patients' exhaled air. The application of AI and machine learning (ML) in diagnosing CRLM has also been extended to histopathological examination in order to rapidly and accurately identify CRLM tissue and its different histopathological growth patterns. ML and CNN have shown good accuracy in predicting response to chemotherapy, early local tumor progression after ablation treatment, and patient survival after surgical treatment or chemotherapy. Despite the initial enthusiasm and the accumulating evidence, AI technologies' role in healthcare and CRLM management is not yet fully established. Its limitations mainly concern safety and the lack of regulation and ethical considerations. AI is unlikely to fully replace any human role but could be actively integrated to facilitate physicians in their everyday practice. Moving towards a personalized and evidence-based patient approach and management, further larger, prospective and rigorous studies evaluating AI technologies in patients at risk or affected by CRLM are needed.",0
410,Early Economic Evaluation Demonstrates That Noncomputerized Tomography Robotic-Assisted Surgery Is Cost-Effective in Patients Undergoing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty at High-Volume Orthopaedic Centres,"Background:
        
      
      For over fifty years, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been used to treat single-compartment osteoarthritis of the knee and is considered a safe alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The development and use of robotic-assisted surgery (r-UKA) have made the execution of the procedure more precise, and various studies have reported improved radiographic outcomes and implant survival rates; however, its cost-effectiveness is unknown. This study aimed at assessing the cost-effectiveness of noncomputerized tomography (non-CT) r-UKA compared to the traditional unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (t-UKA) method in patients with unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis from the UK payer's perspective.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a 5-year four-state Markov model to evaluate the expected costs and outcomes of the two strategies in patients aged 65 years. Failure rates for t-UKA were taken from the British National Joint Registry while data for non-CT r-UKA were obtained from a 2-year observational study. Cost was obtained from the NHS reference cost valued at 2018/19 GBP£, and a discount rate of 3.5% was applied to both costs and benefits.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For a high-volume orthopaedic centre that performs 100 UKA operations per year, non-CT r-UKA was more costly than t-UKA but offered better clinical outcomes, and the estimated cost per QALY was £2,831. The results were more favourable in younger patients aged less than 55 and sensitive to case volumes and follow-up period.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Non-CT r-UKA is cost-effective compared with t-UKA over a 5-year period. Results are dependent on case volumes and follow-up period and favour younger age groups.",0
411,"Pancreaticoduodenectomy in octogenarians: The importance of ""biological age"" on clinical outcomes","Introduction:
        
      
      With the prolongation of life expectancy, an increasing number of elderly patients are evaluated for pancreatic surgery. However, the influence of increasing age on outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is still unclear, especially in octogenarians. Aim of this study is to evaluate the perioperative characteristics and outcomes of octogenarians undergoing PD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data for 812 patients undergoing PD between 2019 and 2020 in 10 referral centers in Italy were reviewed. Patients aged 80 years or older were matched based on nearest neighbor propensity scores in a 1:1 ratio to patients younger than 80 years. Propensity scores were calculated using 7 perioperative variables including gender, ASA score, neoadjuvant treatment (NAT), biliary stent positioning, type of surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, robot-assisted), associated vascular resections, type of lesion. Perioperative characteristics and short-term postoperative outcomes were compared before and after matching.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 81 (10%) patients had 80 years or more. Before matching, octogenarians had a higher rate of ASA score≥ 3 (n = 35, 43.2% vs. n = 207, 28.3%; p = 0.005) and less frequently underwent NAT (n = 11, 13.6% vs. n = 213, 29.1%; p = 0.003). Matching was successfully performed for 70 octogenarians. After matching, no differences in preoperative and intraoperative characteristics were found. Postoperatively, ICU admission was more frequent in octogenarians (50% vs 30%; p = 0.01). Although in-hospital mortality was higher in octogenarians before matching (7.4% vs 2.9% in the younger cohort; p = 0.03), no difference was noted between the matched cohorts (p = 0.36). Postoperative morbidity was comparable between groups in the whole and selected populations. At the multivariate analysis, chronological age was not recognized as a prognostic factor for cumulative major complications, while ASA ≥3 was the only confirmed influencing feature (OR 2.98; 95%CI: 1.6-6.8; p = 0.009).
    


          Conclusio:
        
      
      In high-volume centers, PD in octogenarians shows similar outcomes than younger patients. Age itself should not be considered an exclusion criterion for PD, but a focused preoperative assessment is essential for adequate patient selection.",9
412,Breast ultrasound lesions recognition: end-to-end deep learning approaches,"Multistage processing of automated breast ultrasound lesions recognition is dependent on the performance of prior stages. To improve the current state of the art, we propose the use of end-to-end deep learning approaches using fully convolutional networks (FCNs), namely FCN-AlexNet, FCN-32s, FCN-16s, and FCN-8s for semantic segmentation of breast lesions. We use pretrained models based on ImageNet and transfer learning to overcome the issue of data deficiency. We evaluate our results on two datasets, which consist of a total of 113 malignant and 356 benign lesions. To assess the performance, we conduct fivefold cross validation using the following split: 70% for training data, 10% for validation data, and 20% testing data. The results showed that our proposed method performed better on benign lesions, with a top ""mean Dice"" score of 0.7626 with FCN-16s, when compared with the malignant lesions with a top mean Dice score of 0.5484 with FCN-8s. When considering the number of images with Dice score > 0.5  , 89.6% of the benign lesions were successfully segmented and correctly recognised, whereas 60.6% of the malignant lesions were successfully segmented and correctly recognized. We conclude the paper by addressing the future challenges of the work.",0
413,European Association of Urology Guidelines on Sexual and Reproductive Health-2021 Update: Male Sexual Dysfunction,"Context:
        
      
      The present summary of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines is based on the latest guidelines on male sexual health published in March 2021, with a last comprehensive update in January 2021.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To present a summary of the 2021 version of the EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A literature review was performed up to January 2021. The guidelines were updated, and a strength rating for each recommendation was included based on either a systematic review of the evidence or a consensus opinion from the expert panel.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      Late-onset hypogonadism is a clinical condition in the ageing male combining low levels of circulating testosterone and specific symptoms associated with impaired hormone production and/or action. A comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic work-up, along with screening recommendations and contraindications, is provided. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the persistent inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance. Along with a detailed basic and advanced diagnostic approach, a novel decision-making algorithm for treating ED in order to better tailor therapy to individual patients is provided. The EAU guidelines have adopted the definition of premature ejaculation (PE), which has been developed by the International Society for Sexual Medicine. After the subtype of PE has been defined, patient's expectations should be discussed thoroughly and pharmacotherapy must be considered as the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong PE, whereas treating the underlying cause must be the initial goal for patients with acquired PE. Haemospermia is defined as the appearance of blood in the ejaculate. Several reasons of haemospermia have been acknowledged; the primary goal over the management work-up is to exclude malignant conditions and treat any other underlying cause.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The 2021 guidelines on sexual and reproductive health summarise the most recent findings, and advise in terms of diagnosis and treatment of male hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction for their use in clinical practice. These guidelines reflect the multidisciplinary nature of their management.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Updated European Association of Urology guidelines on sexual and reproductive health are presented, addressing the diagnosis and treatment of the most prevalent conditions in men. Patients must be fully informed of all relevant diagnostic and therapeutic options and, together with their treating physicians, decide on optimal personalised management strategies.",0
414,Clinical outcomes of primary arterial embolization in severe hepatic trauma: A systematic review,"Purpose:
        
      
      This purpose of this systematic review was to determine the safety and efficacy of arterial embolization as the primary treatment for grade III-V liver trauma, excluding the postoperative use of arterial embolization.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A total of 24 studies published between January 2000 and June 2018 qualified for inclusion in this study. Four of them were prospective studies and 20 were retrospective. A total of 3855 patients (mean age, 33.5 years; range: 22-52.5 years) were treated non-operatively and 659 patients (659/3855; 17.09%) with hepatic hemorrhage underwent primary arterial embolization from 2000 to 2017. Indication for arterial embolization was a contrast blush visible on computed tomography in hemodynamically stable patient in all studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The arterial embolization success rate ranged from 80% to 97%. The most commonly reported complication was bile leak, with an incidence of 5.7%. Nineteen bilomas (2.8%) were reported in five studies with a range between 4% and 45%. Hepatic ischemia was reported in eight studies, with a mean incidence of 8.6%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Primary arterial embolization has a high success rate in patients with hepatic trauma. Complications, including biloma and hepatic ischemia, have acceptable rates in the context of a minimally-invasive procedure that allows stabilization of life-threatening, complex liver injuries.",2
415,New geographic model of care to manage the post-COVID-19 elective surgery aftershock in England: a retrospective observational study,"Objectives:
        
      
      The suspension of elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has resulted in record volumes of patients waiting for operations. Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pooled waiting-lists for low-risk elective procedures and patients across integrated, expanded natural surgical community networks have the potential to increase efficiency by innovatively flexing existing supply to better match demand.",3
416,Post-thyroidectomy Hypocalcemia in Patients With History of Bariatric Operations: Current Evidence and Management Options,"Background/aim:
        
      
      Both bariatric and thyroid surgeries promote calcium and vitamin D deficiency. The correlation, however, of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy in patients with previous bariatric surgery has been poorly described. This review aimed to investigate the relationship between history of bariatric operations and post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia, as well as suggested management options.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant publications regarding post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia in patients with previous bariatric surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 17 publications reporting on 126 patients met the inclusion criteria. These included 13 publications about Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 2 regarding biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), 1 about sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and 1 compared three bariatric procedures: SG, RYGB, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB). Post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia was found to be more prevalent in patients with previous RYGB and BPD, but not in previous LAGB and SG.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients with previous bariatric surgery are at high risk of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia that sometimes leads to higher length of hospital stay and demands more invasive solutions. There is a need, however, for additional studies and further investigation in order to reach more conclusive results.",3
417,Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing redo liver resections for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a European multi-center study,"Background:
        
      
      Laparoscopic redo resections for colorectal metastases are poorly investigated. This study aims to explore long-term results after second, third, and fourth resections.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Prospectively updated databases of primary and redo laparoscopic liver resections in six European HPB centers were analyzed. Procedure-related overall survival after first, second, third, and fourth resections were evaluated. Furthermore, patients without liver recurrence after first liver resection were compared to those with one redo, two or three redo, and patients with palliative treatment for liver recurrence after first laparoscopic liver surgery. Survival was calculated both from the date of the first liver resection and from the date of the actual liver resection. In total, 837 laparoscopic primary and redo liver resections performed in 762 patients were included (630 primary, 172 first redo, 29 second redo, and 6 third redo). Patients were bunched into four groups: Group 1-without hepatic recurrence after primary liver resection (n = 441); Group 2-with liver recurrence who underwent only one laparoscopic redo resection (n = 154); Group 3-with liver recurrence who underwent two laparoscopic redo resections (n = 29); Group 4-with liver recurrence who have not been found suitable for redo resections (n = 138).
    


          Results:
        
      
      No significant difference has been found between the groups in terms of baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes. Rate of positive resection margin was higher in the group with palliative recurrence (group 4). Five-year survival calculated from the first liver resection was 67%, 62%, 84%, and 7% for group 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Procedure-specific 5-year overall survival was 50% after primary laparoscopic liver resection, 52% after the 1st reoperation, 52% after the 2nd, and 40% after the 3rd reoperation made laparoscopic.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Multiple redo recurrences can be performed laparoscopically with good long-term results. Liver recurrence does not aggravate prognosis as long as the patient is suitable for reoperation.",9
418,Comparison of time curves from dynamic 18F-fluciclovine positron emission tomography and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for primary prostate carcinomas,"Background and purpose:
        
      
      Multimodal imaging is increasingly included in the assessment of prostate cancer patients, and there is a need to study whether different techniques provide similar or complementary information. In the initial perfusion phase contrast agents and radioactive labelled tracers act as blood-pool agents and may show similar characteristics. The purpose of the current work was to compare time-activity- and time-concentration-curves (TCs) of dynamic 18F-fluciclovine (18F-anti-1-amino-2-[F]-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid, FACBC) positron emission tomography (PET) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Dynamic FACBC PET and DCE MRI were performed on 22 patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer within 23 days prior to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Index tumour was delineated in the images using whole mount tissue sections as reference standard. Tumour TCs from PET and MRI were compared visually and quantitatively by calculating correlation coefficients between the curves at different time points after injection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the first minute post injection, the mean correlation coefficient between the TCs from PET and MRI was 0.92 (range; 0.75-0.99). After the first minute, MRI showed washout while PET showed plateau kinetics.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Dynamic FACBC and DCE MRI showed similar wash-in time curve characteristics. At later time points, FACBC plateaued whereas MR contrast medium washed out. In DCE MRI, the usefulness of wash-in information is well documented. Whether wash-in information from dynamic FACBC can provide added value remains to be documented.",0
419,Recurrence pattern in localized RCC: results from a European multicenter database (RECUR),"Introduction:
        
      
      The impact of open versus minimally invasive surgery on recurrence pattern in the management of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains uncertain. We thus aimed to determine the impact of surgical approach on survival and recurrence pattern.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      This is a multi-institutional, matched cohort study on patients with pT1-3aN0M0 RCC from the RECUR database. After propensity score matching between open and minimally invasive surgery, disease-free (DFS) survival and risk of first recurrence according to recurrence site, namely local recurrence, abdominal/retroperitoneal, thoracic/mediastinal or uncommon site metastases were investigated with Cox regression analysis. Overall (OS) and Cancer Specific Survival (CSS) were also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After matching, 1,019 patients who underwent open and 1,019 who underwent minimally invasive surgery were included (of which 70 robot-assisted). At 5.2 years of median follow-up, 130 patients in open and 125 in minimally invasive group experienced disease progression. A higher risk of local recurrence (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.18-3.58, P-value = 0.01) and uncommon site metastases (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.16; P-value = .04) was found for minimally invasive surgery relative to open surgery, while no difference was found in terms of DFS (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.64-1.06; P-value = .14). No differences were found in terms of OS and CSS. Main limitation is the retrospective nature of the study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The risk for local recurrence and uncommon site metastases was higher for minimally invasive surgery compared to open surgery, although no differences were found for OS, CSS, and DFS.",9
420,Volume-outcome correlation in adrenal surgery-an ESES consensus statement,"Background:
        
      
      Published data in the last decade showed that a majority of adrenal operations are done by surgeons performing only one such case per year and based on the distribution of personal workloads 'high-volume' surgeons are defined as those doing 4 or more cases/year.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This paper summarises literature data identified by a working group established by the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES). The findings were discussed during ESES-2019 conference and members agreed on a consensus statement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The annual of adrenal operations performed yearly in individual countries was reported to be 800/year in UK and over 1600/year in France. The learning curve of an individual surgeon undertaking laparoscopic, retroperitoneoscopic or robotic adrenalectomy is estimated to be 20-40 cases. Preoperative morbidity and length of stay are more favourable in high-volume centres.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The main recommendations are that adrenal surgery should continue only in centres performing at least 6 cases per year, surgery for adrenocortical cancer should be restricted to centres performing at least 12 adrenal operations per year, and an integrated multidisciplinary team should be established in all such centres. Clinical information regarding adrenalectomies should be recorded prospectively and contribution to the established EUROCRINE and ENSAT databases is strongly encouraged. Surgeons wishing to develop expertise in this field should seek mentorship and further training from established adrenal surgeons.",0
421,Outcomes for Atypical Tumor Recurrences Following Minimally Invasive Kidney Cancer Operations,"Background:
        
      
      We managed a cohort of patients treated with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for a kidney tumor presenting with atypical tumor recurrence (ATR) involving port sites, intraperitoneal carcinomatosis, and nephrectomy bed/perinephric tumor implants.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine the clinical characteristics, management, and oncologic outcomes for patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who develop ATR following curative-intent MIS for partial or radical nephrectomy.
    


          Design setting and participants:
        
      
      The study cohort comprised patients from 1999 to 2021 with localized RCC managed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA) after MIS for partial or radical nephrectomy who developed ATR. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We collected data on clinicopathologic characteristics, treatments, time to ATR, and overall survival.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      The median age of the 58 RCC patients was 61 yr. Forty-one patients (71%) were male, 26 (45%) had robot-assisted operations, and 39 (67%) had clear cell RCC. Twenty-nine patients had stage pT1 disease (50%) and ten (17%) had positive surgical margins. The most common ATR site was perinephric/nephrectomy bed implants (n = 28, 48%). Management included: surgical resection alone (n = 11, 19%), systemic therapy alone (n = 12, 21%), surgical resection and systemic therapy (n = 17, 29%), and palliative care (n = 8, 14%). At median follow-up of 59 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 28-92), the median time to ATR was 12 mo (IQR 5-28). Overall survival at 5 yr was 69.0% (95% confidence interval 57.4-83.1%) with only nine patients alive with no evidence of disease. Limitations include the potential for referral, detection, and selection biases, as well as uncertainty regarding the true incidence of ATR.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ATR following MIS for partial or radical nephrectomy is an understudied, poor prognostic event which leads to a heavy treatment burden. Further investigation into its etiology and means of prevention is warranted.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Patients experiencing recurrence of kidney cancer in an atypical site require a heavy treatment burden and have a guarded overall prognosis. Continued research is needed to determine the precise incidence of these recurrences and identify methods for mitigating them.",0
422,Laser-assisted rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (LA-REIMS) as a metabolomics platform in cervical cancer screening,"Background:
        
      
      The introduction of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing as part of primary cervical screening is anticipated to improve sensitivity, but also the number of women who will screen positive. Reflex cytology is the preferred triage test in most settings but has limitations including moderate diagnostic accuracy, lack of automation, inter-observer variability and the need for clinician-collected sample. Novel, objective and cost-effective approaches are needed.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this study, we assessed the potential use of an automated metabolomic robotic platform, employing the principle of laser-assisted Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (LA-REIMS) in cervical cancer screening.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      In a population of 130 women, LA-REIMS achieved 94% sensitivity and 83% specificity (AUC: 91.6%) in distinguishing women testing positive (n = 65) or negative (n = 65) for hrHPV. We performed further analysis according to disease severity with LA-REIMS achieving sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 73% respectively (AUC: 86.7%) in discriminating normal from high-grade pre-invasive disease.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      This automated high-throughput technology holds promise as a low-cost and rapid test for cervical cancer screening and triage. The use of platforms like LA-REIMS has the potential to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the current national screening programme.

423,Temporal ordering of input modulates connectivity formation in a developmental neuronal network model of the cortex,"Preterm infant brain activity is discontinuous; bursts of activity recorded using EEG (electroencephalography), thought to be driven by subcortical regions, display scale free properties and exhibit a complex temporal ordering known as long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). During brain development, activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for synaptic connectivity formation, and abolishing burst activity in animal models leads to weak disorganised synaptic connectivity. Moreover, synaptic pruning shares similar mechanisms to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), suggesting that the timing of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. We investigated, in a computational model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones, whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input could modulate connectivity formation in the network. Connectivity evolved across the course of simulations using an approach analogous to STDP, from networks with initial random connectivity. Small-world connectivity and hub neurones emerged in the network structure-characteristic properties of mature brain networks. Notably, driving the network with an external input which exhibited LRTCs in the temporal ordering of burst activity facilitated the emergence of these network properties, increasing the speed with which they emerged compared with when the network was driven by the same input with the bursts randomly ordered in time. Moreover, the emergence of small-world properties was dependent on the strength of the LRTCs. These results suggest that the temporal ordering of burst activity could play an important role in synaptic connectivity formation and the emergence of small-world topology in the developing brain.",6
424,Open vs minimally invasive radical trachelectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: International Radical Trachelectomy Assessment Study,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive radical trachelectomy has emerged as an alternative to open radical hysterectomy for patients with early-stage cervical cancer desiring future fertility. Recent data suggest worse oncologic outcomes after minimally invasive radical hysterectomy than after open radical hysterectomy in stage I cervical cancer.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to compare 4.5-year disease-free survival after open vs minimally invasive radical trachelectomy.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      This was a collaborative, international retrospective study (International Radical Trachelectomy Assessment Study) of patients treated during 2005-2017 at 18 centers in 12 countries. Eligible patients had squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma; had a preoperative tumor size of ≤2 cm; and underwent open or minimally invasive (robotic or laparoscopic) radical trachelectomy with nodal assessment (pelvic lymphadenectomy and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy). The exclusion criteria included neoadjuvant chemotherapy or preoperative pelvic radiotherapy, previous lymphadenectomy or pelvic retroperitoneal surgery, pregnancy, stage IA1 disease with lymphovascular space invasion, aborted trachelectomy (conversion to radical hysterectomy), or vaginal approach. Surgical approach, indication, and adjuvant therapy regimen were at the discretion of the treating institution. A total of 715 patients were entered into the study database. However, 69 patients were excluded, leaving 646 in the analysis. Endpoints were the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate (primary), 4.5-year overall survival rate (secondary), and recurrence rate (secondary). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate disease-free survival and overall survival. A post hoc weighted analysis was performed, comparing the recurrence rates between surgical approaches, with open surgery being considered as standard and minimally invasive surgery as experimental.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 646 patients, 358 underwent open surgery, and 288 underwent minimally invasive surgery. The median (range) patient age was 32 (20-42) years for open surgery vs 31 (18-45) years for minimally invasive surgery (P=.11). Median (range) pathologic tumor size was 15 (0-31) mm for open surgery and 12 (0.8-40) mm for minimally invasive surgery (P=.33). The rates of pelvic nodal involvement were 5.3% (19 of 358 patients) for open surgery and 4.9% (14 of 288 patients) for minimally invasive surgery (P=.81). Median (range) follow-up time was 5.5 (0.20-16.70) years for open surgery and 3.1 years (0.02-11.10) years for minimally invasive surgery (P<.001). At 4.5 years, 17 of 358 patients (4.7%) with open surgery and 18 of 288 patients (6.2%) with minimally invasive surgery had recurrence (P=.40). The 4.5-year disease-free survival rates were 94.3% (95% confidence interval, 91.6-97.0) for open surgery and 91.5% (95% confidence interval, 87.6-95.6) for minimally invasive surgery (log-rank P=.37). Post hoc propensity score analysis of recurrence risk showed no difference between surgical approaches (P=.42). At 4.5 years, there were 6 disease-related deaths (open surgery, 3; minimally invasive surgery, 3) (log-rank P=.49). The 4.5-year overall survival rates were 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 97.6-99.7) for open surgery and 99.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.0-99.8) for minimally invasive surgery.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The 4.5-year disease-free survival rates did not differ between open radical trachelectomy and minimally invasive radical trachelectomy. However, recurrence rates in each group were low. Ongoing prospective studies of conservative management of early-stage cervical cancer may help guide future management.",9
425,Molecular evolution of broadly neutralizing Llama antibodies to the CD4-binding site of HIV-1,"To date, no immunization of humans or animals has elicited broadly neutralizing sera able to prevent HIV-1 transmission; however, elicitation of broad and potent heavy chain only antibodies (HCAb) has previously been reported in llamas. In this study, the anti-HIV immune responses in immunized llamas were studied via deep sequencing analysis using broadly neutralizing monoclonal HCAbs as a guides. Distinct neutralizing antibody lineages were identified in each animal, including two defined by novel antibodies (as variable regions called VHH) identified by robotic screening of over 6000 clones. The combined application of five VHH against viruses from clades A, B, C and CRF_AG resulted in neutralization as potent as any of the VHH individually and a predicted 100% coverage with a median IC50 of 0.17 µg/ml for the panel of 60 viruses tested. Molecular analysis of the VHH repertoires of two sets of immunized animals showed that each neutralizing lineage was only observed following immunization, demonstrating that they were elicited de novo. Our results show that immunization can induce potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies in llamas with features similar to human antibodies and provide a framework to analyze the effectiveness of immunization protocols.",0
426,Does the Technique of Skin Closure Affect the Cosmesis of Cervical Thyroidectomy and Parathyroidectomy Scars? A Review of Literature,"The cosmetic outcomes following thyroid and parathyroid surgery is a priority for patients as the surgical scar is in a visible area of the body. Although some have advocated the use of minimally invasive and robotic surgery, these are not without risks and it has been suggested that the scars are not necessarily more favorable. The three most common means of skin closure include the use of subcuticular sutures, clips, and tissue adhesive (with or without deeper subcutaneous sutures) and there are no previous reviews of the published evidence. In this study, the authors compare the cosmetic outcomes through a systematic review of literature. Three studies (n = 200) comparing subcuticular sutures and clips suggest superior cosmetic outcomes with sutures (with statistically significant differences in the immediate postoperative period). Three studies (n = 213) comparing sutures and tissue adhesive show superior outcomes with sutures in the early postoperative period with no differences thereafter. Two studies (n = 202) comparing tissue adhesive and clips do not show that one is superior to the other and show no significant differences. Overall the data are limited; however, the evidence suggests that subcuticular sutures may offer superior cosmetic outcomes than clips and tissue adhesive in conventional thyroid and parathyroid surgery.",7
427,Medical-grade Sterilizable Target for Fluid-immersed Fetoscope Optical Distortion Calibration,"We have developed a calibration target for use with fluid-immersed endoscopes within the context of the GIFT-Surg (Guided Instrumentation for Fetal Therapy and Surgery) project. One of the aims of this project is to engineer novel, real-time image processing methods for intra-operative use in the treatment of congenital birth defects, such as spina bifida and the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The developed target allows for the sterility-preserving optical distortion calibration of endoscopes within a few minutes. Good optical distortion calibration and compensation are important for mitigating undesirable effects like radial distortions, which not only hamper accurate imaging using existing endoscopic technology during fetal surgery, but also make acquired images less suitable for potentially very useful image computing applications, like real-time mosaicing. In this paper proposes a novel fabrication method to create an affordable, sterilizable calibration target suitable for use in a clinical setup. This method involves etching a calibration pattern by laser cutting a sandblasted stainless steel sheet. This target was validated using the camera calibration module provided by OpenCV, a state-of-the-art software library popular in the computer vision community.",0
428,Somatosensory cortex participates in the consolidation of human motor memory,"Newly learned motor skills are initially labile and then consolidated to permit retention. The circuits that enable the consolidation of motor memories remain uncertain. Most work to date has focused on primary motor cortex, and although there is ample evidence of learning-related plasticity in motor cortex, direct evidence for its involvement in memory consolidation is limited. Learning-related plasticity is also observed in somatosensory cortex, and accordingly, it may also be involved in memory consolidation. Here, by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to block consolidation, we report the first direct evidence that plasticity in somatosensory cortex participates in the consolidation of motor memory. Participants made movements to targets while a robot applied forces to the hand to alter somatosensory feedback. Immediately following adaptation, continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) was delivered to block retention; then, following a 24-hour delay, which would normally permit consolidation, we assessed whether there was an impairment. It was found that when mechanical loads were introduced gradually to engage implicit learning processes, suppression of somatosensory cortex following training almost entirely eliminated retention. In contrast, cTBS to motor cortex following learning had little effect on retention at all; retention following cTBS to motor cortex was not different than following sham TMS stimulation. We confirmed that cTBS to somatosensory cortex interfered with normal sensory function and that it blocked motor memory consolidation and not the ability to retrieve a consolidated motor memory. In conclusion, the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in adaptation learning, somatosensory cortex rather than motor cortex is involved in the consolidation of motor memory.",6
429,How effective is indocyanine green (ICG) in localization of malignant pulmonary nodules? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Video-Assisted and Robotic-Assisted techniques become constantly more prominent practice in thoracic surgery for lung cancer. Furthermore, the increased frequency in detection of small lung cancers makes the intra-operative identification of these cancers even more challenging. Indocyanine Green (ICG) is one of the most commonly used dyes that assists surgeons identify small lung cancers intra-operatively. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ICG in lung cancer detection.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review of the literature by screening the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and Scopus until 30th April 2022 and the first 300 articles of Google Scholar for any suitable grey literature. We included any study that investigated the effectiveness of ICG in lung cancer detection. We excluded studies that explored the use of ICG only in identification of intersegmental planes, lymph node mapping, case reports and non-English articles. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis on test accuracy studies using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) and the bivariate random-effects models. In cases where the data for a localization technique was not sufficient for that analysis, it was presented with tables with narrative purposes. Each study was assessed for Risk of Bias (RoB) and Applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found 30 eligible studies that included a total of 1,776 patients who underwent ICG localization of pulmonary nodules. We identified three ICG localization techniques: CT-guided, endobronchial and intravenous. From the 30 studies, 13 investigated CT-guided localization, 12 explored an endobronchial method while 8 studies administered ICG intravenously the median reported success rate was 94.3% (IQR: 91.4%-100%) and 98.3% (IQR: 94%-100%) for the first two techniques respectively. Intravenous ICG lung cancer localization showed Sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 59%-0.97%) and Specificity of 25% (95% CI: 0.04%-0.74%). There were 15.2% (150/989) patients who experienced complications from CT guided ICG localization. No ICG-related complications were reported in endobronchial or intravenous techniques.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study provides a comprehensive review of the literature on ICG localization techniques for lung cancer. Current evidence suggests that ICG is boh effective and safe. Further prospective research with standardized protocols across multiple thoracic units is required in order to accurately validate these findings.",0
430,On-the-fly closed-loop materials discovery via Bayesian active learning,"Active learning-the field of machine learning (ML) dedicated to optimal experiment design-has played a part in science as far back as the 18th century when Laplace used it to guide his discovery of celestial mechanics. In this work, we focus a closed-loop, active learning-driven autonomous system on another major challenge, the discovery of advanced materials against the exceedingly complex synthesis-processes-structure-property landscape. We demonstrate an autonomous materials discovery methodology for functional inorganic compounds which allow scientists to fail smarter, learn faster, and spend less resources in their studies, while simultaneously improving trust in scientific results and machine learning tools. This robot science enables science-over-the-network, reducing the economic impact of scientists being physically separated from their labs. The real-time closed-loop, autonomous system for materials exploration and optimization (CAMEO) is implemented at the synchrotron beamline to accelerate the interconnected tasks of phase mapping and property optimization, with each cycle taking seconds to minutes. We also demonstrate an embodiment of human-machine interaction, where human-in-the-loop is called to play a contributing role within each cycle. This work has resulted in the discovery of a novel epitaxial nanocomposite phase-change memory material.",1
431,Oncological outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy for recurrent prostate cancer in the contemporary era: A multicenter retrospective study,"Background:
        
      
      Salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP) historically yields poor functional outcomes and high complication rates. However, recent reports on robotic sRP show improved results. Our objectives were to evaluate sRP oncological outcomes and predictors of positive margins and biochemical recurrence (BCR).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively collected data of sRP for recurrent prostate cancer after local nonsurgical treatment at 18 tertiary referral centers in United States, Australia and Europe, from 2000 to 2016. SM and BCR were evaluated in a univariate and multivariable analysis. Overall and cancer-specific survival were also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 414 cases, 63.5% of them performed after radiotherapy. Before sRP the majority of patients had biopsy Gleason score (GS) ≤7 (55.5%) and imaging negative or with prostatic bed involvement only (93.3%). Final pathology showed aggressive histology in 39.7% (GS ≥9 27.6%), with 52.9% having ≥pT3 disease and 16% pN+. SM was positive in 29.7%. Five years BCR-Free, cancer-specific survival and OS were 56.7%, 97.7% and 92.1%, respectively. On multivariable analysis pathological T (pT3a odds ratio [OR] 2.939, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.469-5.879; ≥pT3b OR 2.428-95% CI 1.333-4.423) and N stage (pN1 OR 2.871, 95% CI 1.503-5.897) were independent predictors of positive margins. Pathological T stage ≥T3b (OR 2.348 95% CI 1.338-4.117) and GS (up to OR 7.183, 95% CI 1.906-27.068 for GS >8) were independent predictors for BCR. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and limited follow-up.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In a contemporary series, sRP showed promising oncological control in the medium term despite aggressive pathological features. BCR risk increased in case of locally advanced disease and higher GS. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings.",2
432,Diagnostically relevant facial gestalt information from ordinary photos,"Craniofacial characteristics are highly informative for clinical geneticists when diagnosing genetic diseases. As a first step towards the high-throughput diagnosis of ultra-rare developmental diseases we introduce an automatic approach that implements recent developments in computer vision. This algorithm extracts phenotypic information from ordinary non-clinical photographs and, using machine learning, models human facial dysmorphisms in a multidimensional 'Clinical Face Phenotype Space'. The space locates patients in the context of known syndromes and thereby facilitates the generation of diagnostic hypotheses. Consequently, the approach will aid clinicians by greatly narrowing (by 27.6-fold) the search space of potential diagnoses for patients with suspected developmental disorders. Furthermore, this Clinical Face Phenotype Space allows the clustering of patients by phenotype even when no known syndrome diagnosis exists, thereby aiding disease identification. We demonstrate that this approach provides a novel method for inferring causative genetic variants from clinical sequencing data through functional genetic pathway comparisons.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02020.001.",0
433,Evaluating a Novel 3D Stereoscopic Visual Display for Transanal Endoscopic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Crossover Study,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare surgical performance with transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) using a novel 3-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic viewer against the current modalities of a 3D stereoendoscope, 3D, and 2-dimensional (2D) high-definition monitors.
    


          Background:
        
      
      TES is accepted as the primary treatment for selected rectal tumors. Current TES systems offer a 2D monitor, or 3D image, viewed directly via a stereoendoscope, necessitating an uncomfortable operating position. To address this and provide a platform for future image augmentation, a 3D stereoscopic display was created.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty participants, of mixed experience level, completed a simulated TES task using 4 visual displays (novel stereoscopic viewer and currently utilized stereoendoscope, 3D, and 2D high-definition monitors) in a randomly allocated order. Primary outcome measures were: time taken, path length, and accuracy. Secondary outcomes were: task workload and participant questionnaire results.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median time taken and path length were significantly shorter for the novel viewer versus 2D and 3D, and not significantly different to the traditional stereoendoscope. Significant differences were found in accuracy, task workload, and questionnaire assessment in favor of the novel viewer, as compared to all 3 modalities.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This novel 3D stereoscopic viewer allows surgical performance in TES equivalent to that achieved using the current stereoendoscope and superior to standard 2D and 3D displays, but with lower physical and mental demands for the surgeon. Participants expressed a preference for this system, ranking it more highly on a questionnaire. Clinical translation of this work has begun with the novel viewer being used in 5 TES patients.",1
434,Breast ultrasound region of interest detection and lesion localisation,"In current breast ultrasound computer aided diagnosis systems, the radiologist preselects a region of interest (ROI) as an input for computerised breast ultrasound image analysis. This task is time consuming and there is inconsistency among human experts. Researchers attempting to automate the process of obtaining the ROIs have been relying on image processing and conventional machine learning methods. We propose the use of a deep learning method for breast ultrasound ROI detection and lesion localisation. We use the most accurate object detection deep learning framework - Faster-RCNN with Inception-ResNet-v2 - as our deep learning network. Due to the lack of datasets, we use transfer learning and propose a new 3-channel artificial RGB method to improve the overall performance. We evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed methods on two datasets (namely, Dataset A and Dataset B), i.e. within individual datasets and composite dataset. We report the lesion detection results with two types of analysis: (1) detected point (centre of the segmented region or the detected bounding box) and (2) Intersection over Union (IoU). Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieved comparable results on detected point but with notable improvement on IoU. In addition, our proposed 3-channel artificial RGB method improves the recall of Dataset A. Finally, we outline some future directions for the research.",4
435,The First Modified Delphi Consensus Statement for Resuming Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery in the COVID-19 Times,The purpose of this study was to achieve consensus amongst a global panel of expert bariatric surgeons on various aspects of resuming Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery (BMS) during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A modified Delphi consensus-building protocol was used to build consensus amongst 44 globally recognised bariatric surgeons. The experts were asked to either agree or disagree with 111 statements they collectively proposed over two separate rounds. An agreement amongst ≥ 70.0% of experts was construed as consensus as per the predetermined methodology. We present here 38 of our key recommendations. This first global consensus statement on the resumption of BMS can provide a framework for multidisciplinary BMS teams planning to resume local services as well as guide future research in this area.,3
436,Use of Near-infrared Spectroscopy and Implantable Doppler for Postoperative Monitoring of Free Tissue Transfer for Breast Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Failure to accurately assess the perfusion of free tissue transfer (FTT) in the early postoperative period may contribute to failure, which is a source of major patient morbidity and healthcare costs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate and appraise current evidence for the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and/or implantable Doppler (ID) devices compared with conventional clinical assessment (CCA) for postoperative monitoring of FTT in reconstructive breast surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews guidelines. Studies in human subjects published within the last decade relevant to the review question were identified. Meta-analysis using random-effects models of FTT failure rate and STARD scoring was then performed on the retrieved publications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nineteen studies met the inclusions criteria. For NIRS and ID, the mean sensitivity for the detection of FTT failure is 99.36% and 100% respectively, with average specificity of 99.36% and 97.63%, respectively. From studies with sufficient reported data, meta-analysis results demonstrated that both NIRS [OR = 0.09 (0.02-0.36); P < 0.001] and ID [OR = 0.39 (0.27-0.95); P = 0.04] were associated with significant reduction of FTT failure rates compared with CCA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of ID and NIRS provided equivalent outcomes in detecting FTT failure and were superior to CCA. The ability to acquire continuous objective physiological data regarding tissue perfusion is a perceived advantage of these techniques. Reduced clinical staff workload and minimized hospital costs are also perceived as positive consequences of their use.",1
437,Which Drug to Discontinue 3 Months After Combination Therapy of Tadalafil plus Tamsulosin for Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptom and Erectile Dysfunction? Results of a Prospective Observational Trial,"Background:
        
      
      Safety and efficacy of tamsulosin and tadalafil for men with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and/or erectile dysfunction (ED) are defined. However, there are only a few pilot studies on combination therapy with these drugs for men with lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS)/BPE and ED. Moreover, preliminary reports are limited to 12 wk, without any information about subsequent therapies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the impact of discontinuation of tamsulosin versus tadalafil 12 wk after combination therapy.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Fifty consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] > 7) and mild-to-severe ED (International Index of Erectile Function-5 [IIEF-5] < 22) were treated with combination therapy (tamsulosin 0.4mg/d plus tadalafil 5mg/d) for 12 wk. After 12 wk, 25 patients discontinued tamsulosin (Group TAD), while 25 patients discontinued tadalafil (Group TAM).
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Efficacy variables were IPSS (total, voiding, storage) and IIEF-5. Paired samples t test and analysis of variance were used.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Groups TAD and TAM presented similar features (age, BMI, metabolic profile) including symptoms scores at baseline. Similar and significant improvements in IPSS (total, voiding, and storage) and IIEF-5 were recorded in both groups after 12 wk of combination therapy (all p< 0.001). Total IPSS was similar between the two groups at the end of the trial. However, we found between-group significant differences from baseline to 24 wk and from 12 to 24 wk in storage-IPSS (Group TAD: -3.32 vs Group TAM: -1.24, p= 0.002; Group TAD: +0.24 vs Group TAM: +1.20, p= 0.040, respectively) and in IIEF-5 (Group TAD: +4.64 vs Group TAM: +0.16, p< 0.001; Group TAD: -1.64 vs Group TAM: -4.40, p= 0.003). No significant treatment-related adverse event was recorded in both groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      After 12 wk of combination therapy, monotherapy with tadalafil for further 12 wk allows to preserve the improvement of storage IPSS and IIEF-5, in addition to total IPSS.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this report we evaluated the discontinuation of tamsulosin or tadalafil after 12 wk of combination therapy. We found that tadalafil monotherapy, for a further 12 wk, aids in retaining the improvement of storage symptoms and erectile function.",2

439,Modified Frailty Index to Assess Risk in Elderly Patients Undergoing Distal Pancreatectomy: A Retrospective Single-Center Study,"Background:
        
      
      To compare the postoperative course of elderly patients (≥70 years) submitted to minimally invasive (MIDP) versus open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) and to evaluate if the modified Frailty Index (mFI) predicts the surgical course of elderly patients submitted to DP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data of patients aged ≥70 who underwent DP at a single institution between March 2011 and December 2019 were retrospectively retrieved. A 2:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used to correct for differences in baseline characteristics. Then, postoperative complications were compared between the two groups (MIDP vs. ODP). Additionally, the entire cohort of DP elderly patients was stratified according to the mFI into three groups: non-frail (mFI = 0), mildly frail (mFI = 1/2), or severely frail (mFI = 3) and then compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 204 patients were analyzed. After PSM, 40 MIDP and 80 ODP patients were identified. The complications considered stratified homogenously between the two groups, with no statistically significant differences. The severity of the postoperative course increased as mFI did among the three groups regarding any complication (p = 0.022), abdominal collection (p = 0.014), pulmonary complication (p = 0.001), postoperative confusion (p = 0.047), Clavien-Dindo severity ≥3 events (p = 0.036), and length of stay (p = 0.018).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Elderly patients can be safely submitted to MIDP. The mFI identifies frail elderly patients more prone to develop surgical and non-surgical complications after DP.",3
440,Comparative effectiveness and safety of image guidance systems in neurosurgery: a preclinical randomized study,"Object:
        
      
      Over the last decade, image guidance systems have been widely adopted in neurosurgery. Nonetheless, the evidence supporting the use of these systems in surgery remains limited. The aim of this study was to compare simultaneously the effectiveness and safety of various image guidance systems against that of standard surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this preclinical, randomized study, 50 novice surgeons were allocated to one of the following groups: 1) no image guidance, 2) triplanar display, 3) always-on solid overlay, 4) always-on wire mesh overlay, and 5) on-demand inverse realism overlay. Each participant was asked to identify a basilar tip aneurysm in a validated model head. The primary outcomes were time to task completion (in seconds) and tool path length (in mm). The secondary outcomes were recognition of an unexpected finding (i.e., a surgical clip) and subjective depth perception using a Likert scale.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The time to task completion and tool path length were significantly lower when using any form of image guidance compared with no image guidance (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). The tool path distance was also lower in groups using augmented reality compared with triplanar display (p = 0.010). Always-on solid overlay resulted in the greatest inattentional blindness (20% recognition of unexpected finding). Wire mesh and on-demand overlays mitigated, but did not negate, inattentional blindness and were comparable to triplanar display (40% recognition of unexpected finding in all groups). Wire mesh and inverse realism overlays also resulted in better subjective depth perception than always-on solid overlay (p = 0.031 and p = 0.008, respectively).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      New augmented reality platforms may improve performance in less-experienced surgeons. However, all image display modalities, including existing triplanar displays, carry a risk of inattentional blindness.",1
441,Zinc transporter 8 autoantibody testing requires age-related cut-offs,"Introduction:
        
      
      Zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A) are biomarkers of beta cell autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes that have become more widely available to clinicians in recent years. Robust control population-defined thresholds are essential to ensure high clinical specificity in islet autoantibody testing. We aimed to determine the optimal cut-offs for ZnT8A testing.
    


          Research design and methods:
        
      
      97.5th and 99th centile cut-offs were determined using residual clinical sera from 1559 controls aged between 0 and 83 years with no history of diabetes and a hemoglobin A1c level of less than 6.0% (<42 mmol/mol). ZnT8A were measured by ELISA (RSR, Cardiff, UK) on a Dynex DS2 ELISA robot (Dynex, Preston, UK). We assessed the impact of age-related cut-offs in comparison with the manufacturer's recommended threshold in a mixed cohort of young-onset (<age 30) diabetes (UNITED study (Using pharmacogeNetics to Improve Treatment in Early-onset Diabetes), n=145).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using the manufacturer's limit of detection, 6 WHO U/mL, 16.2% of people in the control cohort had detectable levels of ZnT8A and those who had detectable ZnT8A were much more likely to be younger (p<0.0001). The 97.5th and 99th centile thresholds were substantially higher in younger participants: 18 and 127 WHO U/mL (tested under 30 years) in comparison with 9 and 21 WHO U/mL (tested 30 years and over). In the UNITED cohort some of those found to be ZnT8A-positive by the manufacturer's threshold but negative using the appropriate 99% centile cut-off (127 WHO U/mL) displayed characteristics suggestive of type 2 diabetes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Age-related thresholds are needed for ZnT8A testing. In those aged <30 years, use of manufacturers' recommended cut-offs may result in low test specificity and potentially high rates of false positive test results in patients who do not have autoimmune diabetes.",5
442,Development of a Robust Multi-Scale Featured Local Binary Pattern for Improved Facial Expression Recognition,"Compelling facial expression recognition (FER) processes have been utilized in very successful fields like computer vision, robotics, artificial intelligence, and dynamic texture recognition. However, the FER's critical problem with traditional local binary pattern (LBP) is the loss of neighboring pixels related to different scales that can affect the texture of facial images. To overcome such limitations, this study describes a new extended LBP method to extract feature vectors from images, detecting each image from facial expressions. The proposed method is based on the bitwise AND operation of two rotational kernels applied on LBP(8,1) and LBP(8,2) and utilizes two accessible datasets. Firstly, the facial parts are detected and the essential components of a face are observed, such as eyes, nose, and lips. The portion of the face is then cropped to reduce the dimensions and an unsharp masking kernel is applied to sharpen the image. The filtered images then go through the feature extraction method and wait for the classification process. Four machine learning classifiers were used to verify the proposed method. This study shows that the proposed multi-scale featured local binary pattern (MSFLBP), together with Support Vector Machine (SVM), outperformed the recent LBP-based state-of-the-art approaches resulting in an accuracy of 99.12% for the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and 89.08% for the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset.",4
443,Accuracy of Pedicle Screw Placement Methods in Pediatrics and Adolescents Spinal Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Study design:
        
      
      Systematic review and meta-analysis.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Various methods of pedicle screw (PS) placement in spinal fusion surgery existed, which can be grouped into conventional freehand (FH), modified freehand (MF), and image-guided methods (including fluoroscopy-based navigation (FL), computed tomography-based navigation (CT-nav), robot-assisted (RA), and ultrasound-guided (UG)). However, the literature showed mixed findings regarding their accuracy and complications. This review aimed to discover which method of PS placement has the highest accuracy and lowest complication rate in pediatric and adolescent spinal fusion surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive search in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), CENTRAL, and Web of Science was conducted until May 2020 by 2 independent reviewers, followed by bias assessment with ROB 2 and ROBINS-I tools and quantification with meta-analysis. Overall evidence quality was determined with GRADE tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four RCTs and 2 quasi-RCTs/CCTs comprising 3,830 PS placed in 291 patients (4-22 years old) were analyzed. The lowest accuracy was found in FH (78.35%) while the highest accuracy was found in MF (95.86%). MF was more accurate than FH (OR 3.34 (95% CI, 2.33-4.79), P < .00 001, I2 = 0%). Three-dimensional printed drill template (as part of MF) was more accurate than FH (OR 3.10 (95% CI, 1.98-4.86), P < .00 001, I2 = 14%). Overall, complications occurred in 5.84% of the patients with 0.34% revision rate. Complication events in MF was lower compared to FH (OR 0.47 (95% CI, 0.10-2.15), P = .33, I2 = 0%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Meta-analysis shows that MF is more accurate than FH in pediatric and adolescent requiring PS placement for spinal fusion surgery.",1
444,Ex vivo model for a new bilateral antimesenteric V-modified side-to-side isoperistaltic anastomosis to prevent recurrence in ileocolic Crohn's disease,"Introduction:
        
      
      The high rate of recurrence following ileocaecal resection for Crohn's disease may lead to repeat surgery in 20-30% of patients at five years after surgery. Recurrence usually occurs at the anastomosis and the neoterminal ileum and the association of a strictureplasty to widen the bowel lumen in the regions immediately proximal ('anastomotic inlet') and distal ('anastomotic outlet') to the anastomosis may delay or reduce the risk of surgical recurrence.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A side to side isoperistaltic anastomosis, with an associated V-modified strictureplasty on the anti-mesenteric border at the level of the anastomosis inlet and outlet has been designed. We produced a wet lab ex vivo model of the anastomosis and, to evaluate the different calibre of the anastomotic segments, we compared it with ex vivo models of three anastomotic configurations currently used in surgery for Crohn's disease: i) side to side isoperistaltic anastomosis; ii) modified side-to-side isoperistaltic anastomosis with double Heineke-Mikulicz procedure (Sasaki anastomosis); iii) anti-mesenteric functional end-to-end handsewn anastomosis (Kono-S anastomosis).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Differences were recorded at the level of the anastomosis inlet and outlet, with a larger volume estimated in the Sasaki anastomosis and in the V-modified anastomosis. The V-modified anastomosis had a larger volume compared with the Sasaki anastomosis for a longer segment of small bowel.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We have developed an experimental animal model for a new anastomotic technique which could be applied in surgery for Crohn's disease following small-bowel or ileocolic resection.",3
445,Posterior shoulder fracture-dislocation: A systematic review of the literature and current aspects of management,"Purpose:
        
      
      Posterior fracture-dislocation of shoulder is an infrequent traumatic event; however, most orthopaedic surgeons may face the challenge of treating it. The aim of this study is to review and summarise systematically the current principles of the management of this complex injury, and create a treatment algorithm.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Both PubMed and Scopus Databases were systematically searched for the terms ""posterior shoulder fracture-dislocation"" or ""posterior glenohumeral fracture-dislocation"" or ""posterior glenoid fracture-dislocation"" for articles written in English and published in the last decade.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 900 articles were identified, of which 13 were retained for analysis. A total of 153 patients (161 shoulders) were identified. These patients were treated either with open reduction and internal fixation, modified McLaughlin procedure, allograft/autograft humeral head reconstruction or shoulder arthroplasty. The mean age was 40.15 years. The mean postoperative Constant score in cases treated by open reduction and internal fixation was 86.45, whereas by bone graft was 84.18. Further, the mean postoperative Constant score was between 79.6 and 67.1 in those that were managed by modified McLaughlin and arthroplasty procedure, respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The management of posterior shoulder fracture-dislocation may be challenging, and the best surgical option depends on many variables such as the chronicity of the injury, the presence of a fracture at the level of the surgical neck or tuberosities and the extend of the Hill-Sachs lesion if any. A treatment algorithm is proposed, based on the current literature in an effort to create a consensus for these injuries. For the acute shoulder fracture-dislocations, an open reduction should be performed. For the chronic fracture/dislocations in the elderly low-demand patients, conservative treatment should be performed. For the rest of the patients, depending on the severity of the Hill-Sachs lesion different surgical options are available such as the McLaughlin technique, the use of an allograft, osteotomy or arthroplasty.",1
446,Laparoscopic versus open resections in the posterosuperior liver segments within an enhanced recovery programme (ORANGE Segments): study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      A shift towards parenchymal-sparing liver resections in open and laparoscopic surgery emerged in the last few years. Laparoscopic liver resection is technically feasible and safe, and consensus guidelines acknowledge the laparoscopic approach in the posterosuperior segments. Lesions situated in these segments are considered the most challenging for the laparoscopic approach. The aim of this trial is to compare the postoperative time to functional recovery, complications, oncological safety, quality of life, survival and costs after laparoscopic versus open parenchymal-sparing liver resections in the posterosuperior liver segments within an enhanced recovery setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The ORANGE Segments trial is an international multicentre randomised controlled superiority trial conducted in centres experienced in laparoscopic liver resection. Eligible patients for minor resections in the posterosuperior segments will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to undergo laparoscopic or open resections in an enhanced recovery setting. Patients and ward personnel are blinded to the treatment allocation until postoperative day 4 using a large abdominal dressing. The primary endpoint is time to functional recovery. Secondary endpoints include intraoperative outcomes, length of stay, resection margin, postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, time to adjuvant chemotherapy initiation, quality of life and overall survival. Laparoscopic liver surgery of the posterosuperior segments is hypothesised to reduce time to functional recovery by 2 days in comparison with open surgery. With a power of 80% and alpha of 0.04 to adjust for interim analysis halfway the trial, a total of 250 patients are required to be randomised.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The ORANGE Segments trial is the first multicentre international randomised controlled study to compare short- and long-term surgical and oncological outcomes of laparoscopic and open resections in the posterosuperior segments within an enhanced recovery programme.

447,"UEG and EAES rapid guideline: Systematic review, meta-analysis, GRADE assessment and evidence-informed European recommendations on TaTME for rectal cancer","Background:
        
      
      Evidence and practice recommendations on the use of transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) for rectal cancer are conflicting.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      We aimed to summarize best evidence and develop a rapid guideline using transparent, trustworthy, and standardized methodology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We developed a rapid guideline in accordance with GRADE, G-I-N, and AGREE II standards. The steering group consisted of general surgeons, members of the EAES Research Committee/Guidelines Subcommittee with expertise and experience in guideline development, advanced medical statistics and evidence synthesis, biostatisticians, and a guideline methodologist. The guideline panel consisted of four general surgeons practicing colorectal surgery, a radiologist with expertise in rectal cancer, a radiation oncologist, a pathologist, and a patient representative. We conducted a systematic review and the results of evidence synthesis by means of meta-analyses were summarized in evidence tables. Recommendations were authored and published through an online authoring and publication platform (MAGICapp), with the guideline panel making use of an evidence-to-decision framework and a Delphi process to arrive at consensus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This rapid guideline provides a weak recommendation for the use of TaTME over laparoscopic or robotic TME for low rectal cancer when expertise is available. Furthermore, it details evidence gaps to be addressed by future research and discusses policy considerations. The guideline, with recommendations, evidence summaries, and decision aids in user-friendly formats can also be accessed in MAGICapp: https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/4494 .
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This rapid guideline provides evidence-informed trustworthy recommendations on the use of TaTME for rectal cancer.",3
448,A workload adaptive haptic shared control scheme for semi-autonomous driving,"Haptic shared control is used to manage the control authority allocation between a human and an autonomous agent in semi-autonomous driving. Existing haptic shared control schemes, however, do not take full consideration of the human agent. To fill this research gap, this study presents a haptic shared control scheme that adapts to a human operator's workload, eyes on road and input torque in real time. We conducted human-in-the-loop experiments with 24 participants. In the experiment, a human operator and an autonomy module for navigation shared the control of a simulated notional High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) at a fixed speed. At the same time, the human operator performed a target detection task. The autonomy could be either adaptive or non-adaptive to the above-mentioned human factors. Results indicate that the adaptive haptic control scheme resulted in significantly lower workload, higher trust in autonomy, better driving task performance and smaller control effort.",4
449,Serum Albumin Domain Structures in Human Blood Serum by Mass Spectrometry and Computational Biology,"Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry has proven useful for studying protein-protein interactions and protein structure, however the low density of cross-link data has so far precluded its use in determining structures de novo. Cross-linking density has been typically limited by the chemical selectivity of the standard cross-linking reagents that are commonly used for protein cross-linking. We have implemented the use of a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent, sulfosuccinimidyl 4,4'-azipentanoate (sulfo-SDA), combining a traditional sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) ester and a UV photoactivatable diazirine group. This diazirine yields a highly reactive and promiscuous carbene species, the net result being a greatly increased number of cross-links compared with homobifunctional, NHS-based cross-linkers. We present a novel methodology that combines the use of this high density photo-cross-linking data with conformational space search to investigate the structure of human serum albumin domains, from purified samples, and in its native environment, human blood serum. Our approach is able to determine human serum albumin domain structures with good accuracy: root-mean-square deviation to crystal structure are 2.8/5.6/2.9 Å (purified samples) and 4.5/5.9/4.8Å (serum samples) for domains A/B/C for the first selected structure; 2.5/4.9/2.9 Å (purified samples) and 3.5/5.2/3.8 Å (serum samples) for the best out of top five selected structures. Our proof-of-concept study on human serum albumin demonstrates initial potential of our approach for determining the structures of more proteins in the complex biological contexts in which they function and which they may require for correct folding. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001692.",7
450,Gait asymmetry detection in older adults using a light ear-worn sensor,"Measuring gait asymmetry is an important feature when characterizing functional imbalance between limbs. This could be due to pathologies, such as osteoarthritis, stroke, or associated with the effects of surgeries such as hip arthroplasty. Generally, the study of asymmetry or imbalance has required the use of a gait lab or force plates, which could be expensive and difficult to use in home settings. This work validates the use of a light weight ear sensor (7.4 g) with an instrumented treadmill for 64 subjects (age (60.04 (15.36)) including healthy subjects (14) as well as subjects who had been treated for hip (17), knee-replacement surgery (21) and knee osteoarthritis (12). Subjects performed treadmill walking at several speeds on flat surfaces, inclines and declines. Accelerometer data from the ear sensor were segmented into consecutive steps and temporal features were extracted. The measures of gait cycle time and step-period asymmetry obtained from the ear sensor matched well those of the treadmill for flat surfaces, inclines and declines. The key implication of the study is that the proposed method could replace expensive equipment for monitoring temporal gait features in clinics as well as free-living environments, which is important for monitoring rehabilitation after surgery and the progress of diseases affecting limb imbalance.",0
451,Induced neural stem cell differentiation on a drawn fiber scaffold-toward peripheral nerve regeneration,"To achieve regeneration of long sections of damaged nerves, restoration methods such as direct suturing or autologous grafting can be inefficient. Solutions involving biohybrid implants, where neural stem cells are grown in vitro on an active support before implantation, have attracted attention. Using such an approach, combined with recent advancements in microfabrication technology, the chemical and physical environment of cells can be tailored in order to control their behaviors. Herein, a neural stem cell polycarbonate fiber scaffold, fabricated by 3D printing and thermal drawing, is presented. The combined effect of surface microstructure and chemical functionalization using poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) on the biocompatibility of the scaffold, induced differentiation of the neural stem cells (NSCs) and channeling of the neural cells was investigated. Upon treatment of the fiber scaffold with a suspension of DWCNTs in PLO (0.039 g l-1) and without recombinants a high degree of differentiation of NSCs into neuronal cells was confirmed by using nestin, galactocerebroside and doublecortin immunoassays. These findings illuminate the potential use of this biohybrid approach for the realization of future nerve regenerative implants.",0
452,Formalizing planning and information search in naturalistic decision-making,"Decisions made by mammals and birds are often temporally extended. They require planning and sampling of decision-relevant information. Our understanding of such decision-making remains in its infancy compared with simpler, forced-choice paradigms. However, recent advances in algorithms supporting planning and information search provide a lens through which we can explain neural and behavioral data in these tasks. We review these advances to obtain a clearer understanding for why planning and curiosity originated in certain species but not others; how activity in the medial temporal lobe, prefrontal and cingulate cortices may support these behaviors; and how planning and information search may complement each other as means to improve future action selection.",4
453,Laparoscopic colorectal surgery and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program: Experience with 200 cases from a single Italian center,"There is increasing evidence that minimally invasive techniques associated with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols reduce surgery-related stress and promote faster recovery after major colorectal surgery. As a single tertiary referral center for colorectal surgery, our aim was to analyze the effects of our ERAS protocol on a heterogeneous population undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery.Prospectively collected data from 283 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection at the Division of General and Hepatobiliary Surgery, University of Verona Hospital Trust, between March 2014 and March 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients' adherence to pre-, intra-, and postoperative ERAS protocol items together with surgical short-term outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate was considered.The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata di Verona (CRINF-1034 CESC).During the study period, 200 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the ERAS protocol. In this series, 34% of patients were aged 70 years or older. Rectal resections represented 26% of all cases, with stoma formation performed in 14.5% of patients. Despite such procedural heterogeneity, good short-term results were obtained: by postoperative day (POD) 2, 58.5% of patients had full return of bowel function, while 63.5% and 88% achieved regular soft diet intake and autonomous walking, respectively. Median (range) length of hospital stay was 5.5 days (2-40) with 71% of patients being discharged by POD 6. No postoperative mortality was recorded, and the rate of major complications was 3.5%. During the study period, 6 patients required redo surgery (3%) and 5 patients required rehospitalization within 30 days (2.5%).This study analyzing the results of the fast-track program in our first 200 cases confirms the feasibility and safety of ERAS protocol application within a heterogeneous population undergoing laparoscopic colonic and rectal resection for benign and malignant diseases.",3
454,Multispectral imaging of organ viability during uterine transplantation surgery in rabbits and sheep,"Uterine transplantation surgery (UTx) has been proposed as a treatment for permanent absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI) in the case of the congenital absence or surgical removal of the uterus. Successful surgical attachment of the organ and its associated vasculature is essential for the organ’s reperfusion and long-term viability. Spectral imaging techniques have demonstrated the potential for the measurement of hemodynamics in medical applications. These involve the measurement of reflectance spectra by acquiring images of the tissue in different wavebands. Measures of tissue constituents at each pixel can then be extracted from these spectra through modeling of the light–tissue interaction. A multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope was used in sheep and rabbit UTx models to study short- and long-term changes in oxygen saturation following surgery. The whole organ was imaged in the donor and recipient animals in parallel with point measurements from a pulse oximeter. Imaging results confirmed the re-establishment of adequate perfusion in the transplanted organ after surgery. Cornual oxygenation trends measured with MSI are consistent with pulse oximeter readings, showing decreased StO2 immediately after anastomosis of the blood vessels. Long-term results show recovery of StO2 to preoperative levels.",0
455,Embryonal precursors of Wilms tumor,"Adult cancers often arise from premalignant clonal expansions. Whether the same is true of childhood tumors has been unclear. To investigate whether Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma; a childhood kidney cancer) develops from a premalignant background, we examined the phylogenetic relationship between tumors and corresponding normal tissues. In 14 of 23 cases studied (61%), we found premalignant clonal expansions in morphologically normal kidney tissues that preceded tumor development. These clonal expansions were defined by somatic mutations shared between tumor and normal tissues but absent from blood cells. We also found hypermethylation of the H19 locus, a known driver of Wilms tumor development, in 58% of the expansions. Phylogenetic analyses of bilateral tumors indicated that clonal expansions can evolve before the divergence of left and right kidney primordia. These findings reveal embryonal precursors from which unilateral and multifocal cancers develop.",0
456,State-of-the-art surgery for sigmoid diverticulitis,"Background:
        
      
      In the last two decades, there has been a Copernican revolution in the decision-making for the treatment of Diverticular Disease.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      This article provides a report on the state-of-the-art of surgery for sigmoid diverticulitis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Acute diverticulitis is the most common reason for colonic resection after cancer; in the last decade, the indication for surgical resection has become more and more infrequent also in emergency. Currently, emergency surgery is seldom indicated, mostly for severe abdominal infective complications. Nowadays, uncomplicated diverticulitis is the most frequent presentation of diverticular disease and it is usually approached with a conservative medical treatment. Non-Operative Management may be considered also for complicated diverticulitis with abdominal abscess. At present, there is consensus among experts that the hemodynamic response to the initial fluid resuscitation should guide the emergency surgical approach to patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients, a laparoscopic approach is the first choice, and surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills report advantages in terms of lower postoperative complication rates. At the moment, the so-called Hartmann's procedure is only indicated in severe generalized peritonitis with metabolic derangement or in severely ill patients. Some authors suggested laparoscopic peritoneal lavage as a bridge to surgery or also as a definitive treatment without colonic resection in selected patients. In case of hemodynamic instability not responding to fluid resuscitation, an initial damage control surgery seems to be more attractive than a Hartmann's procedure, and it is associated with a high rate of primary anastomosis.",3
457,eAMI: a qualitative quantification of periodic breathing based on amplitude of oscillations,"Study objectives:
        
      
      Periodic breathing is sleep disordered breathing characterized by instability in the respiratory pattern that exhibits an oscillatory behavior. Periodic breathing is associated with increased mortality, and it is observed in a variety of situations, such as acute hypoxia, chronic heart failure, and damage to respiratory centers. The standard quantification for the diagnosis of sleep related breathing disorders is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which measures the proportion of apneic/ hypopneic events during polysomnography. Determining the AHI is labor-intensive and requires the simultaneous recording of airflow and oxygen saturation. In this paper, we propose an automated, simple, and novel methodology for the detection and qualification of periodic breathing: the estimated amplitude modulation index (eAMI).
    


          Patients or participants:
        
      
      Antarctic Cohort (3800 meters): 13 normal individuals. Sleep Clinic Cohort: 39 different patients suffering from diverse sleep-related pathologies.
    


          Measurements and results:
        
      
      When tested in a population with high levels of periodic breathing (Antarctic Cohort), eAMI was closely correlated with AHI (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). When tested in the clinical setting, the proposed method was able to detect portions of the signal in which subclinical periodic breathing was validated by an expert (n = 93; accuracy = 0.85). Average eAMI was also correlated with the loop gain for the combined clinical and Antarctica cohorts (r = 0.58, P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In terms of quantification and temporal resolution, the eAMI is able to estimate the strength of periodic breathing and the underlying loop gain at any given time within a record. The impaired prognosis associated with periodic breathing makes its automated detection and early diagnosis of clinical relevance.",0
458,Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma to the Cervical Lymph Nodes From an Unknown Primary Cancer: Management in the HPV Era,"Background:
        
      
      Patients with metastases in the lymph nodes of the neck and no obvious primary tumor, neck cancer with unknown primary (NCUP), represent a management challenge. A majority of patients have metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), although other histologies do occur.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We comprehensively reviewed the literature, compared available guidelines, and conferred with an international team of experts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) under ultrasound guidance increase accuracy of diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), determination of human papilloma virus (HPV) status, by p16 staining or by in situ hybridization (ISH), and next-generation gene sequencing can guide us regarding probable primary sites and tumor biology. Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) has been introduced for the early detection of subtle mucosal lesions. Direct laryngoscopy (DL) and tonsillectomy have long been procedures used in the search for a primary site. More recently, TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) or Transoral LASER Microsurgery (TLM) have been introduced for lingual tonsillectomy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      New technologies have been developed which can better detect, diagnose, and treat occult primary tumors. Decisions regarding therapy are based on the primary tumor site (if discovered) and N stage. Options include neck dissection with or without postoperative adjuvant therapy, primary irradiation, or combined chemotherapy with irradiation. The preferred treatment of patients whose primary remains unidentified is controversial.",0

      Anterolateral rotatory instability (ALRI) may result from combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and lateral extra-articular lesions, but the roles of the anterolateral structures remain controversial.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To determine the contribution of each anterolateral structure and the ACL in restraining simulated clinical laxity in both the intact and ACL-deficient knee.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Controlled laboratory study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 16 knees were tested using a 6 degrees of freedom robot with a universal force-moment sensor. The system automatically defined the path of unloaded flexion/extension. At different flexion angles, anterior-posterior, internal-external, and internal rotational laxity in response to a simulated pivot shift were tested. Eight ACL-intact and 8 ACL-deficient knees were tested. The kinematics of the intact/deficient knee was replayed after transecting/resecting each structure of interest; therefore, the decrease in force/torque reflected the contribution of the transected/resected structure in restraining laxity. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analyses of variance and paired t tests.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For anterior translation, the intact ACL was clearly the primary restraint. The iliotibial tract (ITT) resisted 31% ± 6% of the drawer force with the ACL cut at 30° of flexion; the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and anterolateral capsule resisted 4%. For internal rotation, the superficial layer of the ITT significantly restrained internal rotation at higher flexion angles: 56% ± 20% and 56% ± 16% at 90° for the ACL-intact and ACL-deficient groups, respectively. The deep layer of the ITT restrained internal rotation at lower flexion angles, with 26% ± 9% and 33% ± 12% at 30° for the ACL-intact and ACL-deficient groups, respectively. The other anterolateral structures provided no significant contribution. During the pivot-shift test, the ITT provided 72% ± 14% of the restraint at 45° for the ACL-deficient group. The ACL and other anterolateral structures made only a small contribution in restraining the pivot shift.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The ALL and anterolateral capsule had a minor role in restraining internal rotation; the ITT was the primary restraint at 30° to 90° of flexion.
    


          Clinical relevance:
        
      
      The ITT showed large contributions in restraining anterior subluxation of the lateral tibial plateau and tibial internal rotation, which constitute pathological laxity in ALRI. In cases with ALRI, an ITT injury should be suspected and kept in mind if an extra-articular procedure is performed.",8
460,A Pilot Study Evaluating the Effectiveness of Dual-Registration Image-Guided Radiotherapy in Patients with Oropharyngeal Cancer,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of the article was to determine the impact of Dual Registration (DR) image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on clinical judgement and treatment delivery for patients with oropharyngeal cancer before implementation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ninety cone beam computed tomography images from 10 retrospective patients were matched using standard clipbox registration (SCR) and DR. Three IGRT specialist radiographers performed all registrations and evaluated by intraclass correlation to determine inter-rater agreement, Bland-Altman with 95% limits of agreement to determine differences between SCR and DR procedures, changes in clinical judgment, time taken to perform registrations, and radiographer satisfaction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Inter-rater agreement between radiographers using both SCR and DR was high (0.867 and 0.917, P ≤ .0001). The 95% limits of agreement between SCR and DR procedures in the mediolateral, cranial-caudal, and ventrodorsal translational directions were -6.40 to +4.91, -7.49 to +6.05, and -7.00 to +5.44 mm, respectively. The mediolateral direction demonstrated significant proportional bias (P ≤ .001) suggesting non-agreement between SCR and DR. Eighty percent of DR matches resulted in a change in clinical judgement to ensure maximum target coverage. Mean registration times for SCR and DR were 94 and 115 seconds, respectively, and radiographers found DR feasible and satisfactory.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The standard method using SCR in patients with oropharyngeal cancer underestimates the deviation in the lower neck. In these patients, DR is an effective IGRT tool to ensure target coverage of the inferior neck nodes and has demonstrated acceptability to radiotherapy clinical practice.",0
461,Moral Decision Making in Human-Agent Teams: Human Control and the Role of Explanations,"With the progress of Artificial Intelligence, intelligent agents are increasingly being deployed in tasks for which ethical guidelines and moral values apply. As artificial agents do not have a legal position, humans should be held accountable if actions do not comply, implying humans need to exercise control. This is often labeled as Meaningful Human Control (MHC). In this paper, achieving MHC is addressed as a design problem, defining the collaboration between humans and agents. We propose three possible team designs (Team Design Patterns), varying in the level of autonomy on the agent's part. The team designs include explanations given by the agent to clarify its reasoning and decision-making. The designs were implemented in a simulation of a medical triage task, to be executed by a domain expert and an artificial agent. The triage task simulates making decisions under time pressure, with too few resources available to comply with all medical guidelines all the time, hence involving moral choices. Domain experts (i.e., health care professionals) participated in the present study. One goal was to assess the ecological relevance of the simulation. Secondly, to explore the control that the human has over the agent to warrant moral compliant behavior in each proposed team design. Thirdly, to evaluate the role of agent explanations on the human's understanding in the agent's reasoning. Results showed that the experts overall found the task a believable simulation of what might occur in reality. Domain experts experienced control over the team's moral compliance when consequences were quickly noticeable. When instead the consequences emerged much later, the experts experienced less control and felt less responsible. Possibly due to the experienced time pressure implemented in the task or over trust in the agent, the experts did not use explanations much during the task; when asked afterwards they however considered these to be useful. It is concluded that a team design should emphasize and support the human to develop a sense of responsibility for the agent's behavior and for the team's decisions. The design should include explanations that fit with the assigned team roles as well as the human cognitive state.",4
462,Automatic Detection of Abnormalities and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy in 6-Field Retinal Images: Integration of Segmentation Into Classification,"Purpose:
        
      
      Classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is traditionally based on severity grading, given by the most advanced lesion, but potentially leaving out relevant information for risk stratification. In this study, we aimed to develop a deep learning model able to individually segment seven different DR-lesions, in order to test if this would improve a subsequently developed classification model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      First, manual segmentation of 34,075 different DR-lesions was used to construct a segmentation model, with performance subsequently compared to another retinal specialist. Second, we constructed a 5-step classification model using a data set of 31,325 expert-annotated retinal 6-field images and evaluated if performance was improved with the integration of presegmentation given by the segmentation model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The segmentation model had higher average sensitivity across all abnormalities compared to the retinal expert (0.68 and 0.62) at a comparable average F1-score (0.60 and 0.62). Model sensitivity for microaneurysms, retinal hemorrhages and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities was higher by 42.5%, 8.8%, and 67.5% and F1-scores by 15.8%, 6.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. When presegmentation was included, grading performance increased by 29.7%, 6.0%, and 4.5% for average per class accuracy, quadratic weighted kappa, and multiclass macro area under the curve, with values of 70.4%, 0.90, and 0.92, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The segmentation model matched an expert in detecting retinal abnormalities, and presegmentation substantially improved accuracy of the automated classification model.
    


          Translational relevance:
        
      
      Presegmentation may yield more accurate automated DR grading models and increase interpretability and trust in model decisions.",0
463,Operating hurts: a study of EAES surgeons,"Background:
        
      
      Work-related pain and discomfort experienced by surgeons is widely reported in the literature. A survey was, therefore, conducted to explore this issue among members of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The survey was emailed to 2980 EAES members in 2017 enquiring about their working practice, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and burnout.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 569 (19%) surgeons responded, of whom 556 were practicing surgeons; 86% were consultants, 84% were male, and 94% were right-handed. Respondents operated on average 3.3 days/week with 27% of their procedures lasting longer than 3 h. The 386 endoscopists surveyed reported performing an average of 5.3 procedures/day with 83% performing endoscopy at least once per week. Over half of practicing surgeons (62%) reported their worst pain score was 3 or higher (10-point scale) in the past 7 working days, encompassing 71% of their open, 72% laparoscopic, 48% robot-assisted cases and 52% of their endoscopies. Of the 120 surgeons who had ever sought medical help for aches, pain or discomfort, 38% were currently in pain and 16% had considered leaving surgery due to their MSK pain, 26% had reported work-related pain to their employer, 26% had been on short-term disability during their career and 4% long-term disability due to MSK disorders. A significant proportion of the respondents (49%) felt their physical discomfort would influence the ability to perform or assist with surgical procedures in the future. These surgeons reported significantly lower satisfaction from their work (p = 0.024), higher burnout (p = 0.005) and significantly higher callousness toward people (p < 0.001) than those not fearing loss of career longevity.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results show that MSK pain is prevalent amongst EAES members. Nearly half the respondents had career longevity fears from pain/discomfort which, in turn, correlated with more prevalent feelings of burnout. More emphasis should be placed on the aetiology, prevention and management of musculoskeletal pain in the surgical workforce.",0
464,Quantifying severe urinary complications after radical prostatectomy: the development and validation of a surgical performance indicator using hospital administrative data,"Objectives:
        
      
      To develop and validate a surgical performance indicator based on severe urinary complications that require an intervention within 2 years of radical prostatectomy (RP), identified in hospital administrative data.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Men who underwent RP between 2008 and 2012 in England were identified using hospital administrative data. A transparent coding framework based on procedure codes was developed to identify severe urinary complications which were grouped into 'stricture', 'incontinence' and 'other'. Their validity as a performance indicator was assessed by evaluating the consistency with diagnosis codes and association with patient and surgical characteristics. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess time to first occurrence and multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for patient and surgical characteristics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 17 299 men were included, of whom 2695 (15.6%) experienced at least one severe urinary complication within 2 years. High proportions of men with a complication had relevant diagnosis codes: 86% for strictures and 93% for incontinence. Urinary complications were more common in men from poorer socio-economic backgrounds (OR comparing lowest with highest quintile: 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-1.67) and in those with prolonged length of hospital stay (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.40-1.69), and were less common in men who underwent robot-assisted surgery (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.74).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These results show that severe urinary complications identified in administrative data provide a medium-term performance indicator after RP. They can be used for research assessing outcomes of treatment methods and for service evaluation comparing performance of prostate cancer surgery providers.",5
465,Blockchain Technology Application Challenges in Renewable Energy Supply Chain Management,"With the advent of new technologies and globalization of business, supply chains have turned into indispensable tools for gaining competitive advantage. The application of new technologies like blockchain can benefit sustainable energy supply chains by improving chain and logistics operations in the areas of trust, transparency and accountability, cooperation, information sharing, financial exchanges, and supply chain integration. However, the efforts to adopt such technologies in supply chains tend to face many challenges and challenges, which can seriously threaten their success. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine the challenges to blockchain technology application. This research focuses on identifying the criteria and challenges to the application of blockchain in renewable energy supply chains and also ranks the identified challenges in terms of their capacity to disrupt the process. The applicability of the suggested structure is examined in a case study of the renewable energy supply chain of Iran. In this study, the challenges are evaluated and ranked by the hybrid developed methods by the integration of the concept of gray numbers into the gray stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA-Gray) and the gray evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS-Gray). Another group of hybrid methods including the gray weighted sum method (WSM-Gray), the gray complex proportional assessment (COPRAS-Gray), and the gray technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS-Gray) is used to validate the results. The rankings obtained from all of these techniques show high degree of correlation. Among the identified challenges, ""high investment cost"" is found to be the most important challenge to the application of blockchain in sustainable energy supply chains.",4
466,"Modeling Adoption, Security, and Privacy of COVID-19 Apps: Findings and Recommendations From an Empirical Study Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology","Background:
        
      
      The global health crisis caused by COVID-19 has drastically changed human society in a relatively short time. However, this crisis has offered insights into the different roles that such a worldwide virus plays in the lives of people and how those have been affected, as well as eventually proposing new solutions. From the beginning of the pandemic, technology solutions have featured prominently in virus control and in the frame of reference for international travel, especially contact tracing and passenger locator applications.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objective of this paper is to study specific areas of technology acceptance and adoption following a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) research model.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We presented a research model based on UTAUT constructs to study the determinants for adoption of COVID-19-related apps using a questionnaire. We tested the model via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) using travelers' data from an insular tourist region.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our model explained 90.3% of the intention to use (N=9555) and showed an increased understanding of the vital role of safety, security, privacy, and trust in the usage intention of safety apps. Results also showed how the impact of COVID-19 is not a strong predictor of adoption, while age, education level, and social capital are essential moderators of behavioral intention.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In terms of scientific impact, the results described here provide important insights and contributions not only for researchers but also for policy and decision makers by explaining the reasons behind the adoption and usage of apps designed for COVID-19.",4
467,Sepsis Subclasses: A Framework for Development and Interpretation,"Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. It afflicts approximately 50 million people worldwide annually and is often deadly, even when evidence-based guidelines are applied promptly. Many randomized trials tested therapies for sepsis over the past 2 decades, but most have not proven beneficial. This may be because sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by a vast set of clinical and biologic features. Combinations of these features, however, may identify previously unrecognized groups, or ""subclasses"" with different risks of outcome and response to a given treatment. As efforts to identify sepsis subclasses become more common, many unanswered questions and challenges arise. These include: 1) the semantic underpinning of sepsis subclasses, 2) the conceptual goal of subclasses, 3) considerations about study design, data sources, and statistical methods, 4) the role of emerging data types, and 5) how to determine whether subclasses represent ""truth."" We discuss these challenges and present a framework for the broader study of sepsis subclasses. This framework is intended to aid in the understanding and interpretation of sepsis subclasses, provide a mechanism for explaining subclasses generated by different methodologic approaches, and guide clinicians in how to consider subclasses in bedside care.",0
468,Minimally invasive colorectal surgery in the morbid obese: does size really matter?,"Background:
        
      
      As obesity becomes more prevalent, it presents a technical challenge for minimally invasive colorectal resection surgery. Various studies have examined the clinical outcomes of obese surgical patients. However, morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥ 35) are becoming increasingly more common. This study aims to investigate the short-term surgical outcomes of morbidly obese patients undergoing minimal-invasive colorectal surgery and compare them with both obese (30 ≤ BMI < 35) and non-obese patients (BMI < 30).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients from three centres who received minimally invasive colorectal surgical resections between 2006 and 2016 were identified from prospectively collected databases. The baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes of morbidly obese, obese and non-obese patients were analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1386 patients were identified, 84 (6%) morbidly obese, 246 (18%) obese and 1056 (76%) non-obese. Patients' baseline characteristics were similar for age, operating surgeon, surgical approach but differed in terms of ASA grade and gender. There was no difference in conversion rate, length of stay, anastomotic leak rate and 30-day readmission, reoperation and mortality rates. Operation time and blood loss were different across the 3 groups (morbidly obese vs obese vs non-obese: 185 vs 188 vs 170 min, p = 0.000; 20 vs 20 vs 10 ml, p = 0.003). In patients with malignant disease there was no difference in lymph node yield or R0 clearance. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis showed that for every one-unit increase in BMI operative time increases by roughly 2 min (univariate 2.243, 95% CI 1.524-2.962; multivariate 2.295; 95% CI 1.554-3.036). Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that BMI does not affect conversion or morbidity and mortality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The increased technical difficulty encountered in obese and morbidly obese patients in minimally invasive colorectal surgery results in higher operative times and blood loss, although this is not clinically significant. However, conversion rate and post-operative short-term outcomes are similar between morbidly obese, obese and non-obese patients.",2
469,The effectiveness of interventions to improve the care and management of people with dementia in general hospitals: A systematic review,"Background:
        
      
      People with dementia are at greater risk of being admitted to hospital where care may not be tailored to their needs. Interventions improving care and management are vital.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      Assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve the care and management of people with dementia in hospital.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Six medical and trial registry, and grey literature databases were searched (1999-1998/2018). Search terms included ""Dementia,"" ""Hospital,"" and ""Intervention"" and limited to experimental designs. Interventions designed to improve the care and management of people with dementia in the general hospital setting were examined. Outcomes included behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), psychosocial, clinical, staff knowledge, and length of hospital stay. The CASP tools, Cochrane risk of bias tool, and GRADE system assessed methodological quality and certainty of evidence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      9003 unique citations were identified; 24 studies were included. Studies were limited in study design and their conduct was at a risk of bias. There is very low-quality evidence that multisensory behaviour therapy reduces BPSD. There is low-quality evidence that a multidisciplinary programme reduces postoperative complications and that robot-assisted therapy, music therapy, multimodal-comprehensive care, person-centred care, and family-centred function-focused care interventions improved staff knowledge, competence, efficacy, and communication. No studies reported reduced length of stay.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Whilst we found that these interventions improved the care and management of people with dementia in hospital, it was low- to very low-quality evidence. New clinical recommendations cannot be made based on current evidence, and robust trial designs are necessary to inform evidence-based care.",3
470,Critical Analysis of Early Recurrence after Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy in a Large Cohort by the ESUT,"Purpose:
        
      
      We analyze patients with early progression after laparoscopic radical cystectomy in a large cohort by the ESUT (European Association of Urology Section of Uro-Technology). More specifically we focus on patients with favorable pathology (pT2 N0 R0 or less) who experienced an unexpected recurrence and analyze possible causes for such early recurrence, discussing the surgical technique including pneumoperitoneum.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Since 2000 the ESUT has been constructing a large, multicenter, prospective database of patients undergoing laparoscopic radical cystectomy. All procedures were performed via a standard laparoscopic approach without robotic assistance. We specifically analyzed patients with favorable pathological characteristics, in particular pT2 N0 R0 or less, and evaluated those with progression despite these favorable characteristics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate risk factors for early recurrence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 627 patients were available for final analysis with a median followup of 46 months (mean 57). Of these patients 311 had favorable pathological characteristics of pT2 N0 R0 or less. During followup 27 (8.7%) patients experienced disease progression during the first 24 months. Surgical negligence was found in only 1 case. Most of these patients with early recurrence had progression to high tumor volume disseminated metastatic disease. On multivariate logistic regression tumor stage was the only factor significantly associated with early recurrence (p=0.027).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We report early unexpected recurrences after laparoscopic radical cystectomy in nearly 5% of our entire cohort, all in patients with favorable pathological characteristics (pT2 N0 R0 or less). Pneumoperitoneum may have had a role in the development of these relapses. Specifically designed studies are necessary to investigate the possible role of pneumoperitoneum in urothelial cancer recurrence.",2
471,Quantifying the scientific interest in surgical training and education: numerical evidence of a PubMed analysis,"The scientific interest (SI) for a given field can be ascertained by quantifying the volume of published research. We quantified the SI in surgical education to clarify the extent of worldwide efforts on this crucial factor required to improve health-care systems. A set of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was defined for the PubMed search. The number of Pubmed Indexed Papers (nPIP) relevant to the SI was extracted from database conception to December 2016 and their distribution and evolution by country were analyzed at 10-year intervals. Population Adjusted Index (PAI) and Medical School Adjusted Index (MSAI) analyses were performed for countries with the nPIP > 30. We identified 51,713 articles written in 33 different languages related to surgical education; 87.6% of these were written in English. General surgery was the leading surgical specialty. The overall nPIP doubled every 10 years from 1987 (from 6009 to 13,501, to 26,272) but stabilized at 3707, 3800 and 3433 in the past 3 years, respectively. The PAI and MSAI analyses showed that the USA, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Ireland are top producers of published research in surgical education, constituting a combined 62.88% of the nPIP. Our quantification of the change in SI in surgical education and training gives a clear picture of evolution, efforts and leadership worldwide over time. This picture mirrors an international academic society that should encourage all those involved in surgical education to improve efforts in educational research.",0
472,"Not robots: children's perspectives on authenticity, moral agency and stimulant drug treatments","In this article, I examine children's reported experiences with stimulant drug treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in light of bioethical arguments about the potential threats of psychotropic drugs to authenticity and moral agency. Drawing on a study that involved over 150 families in the USA and the UK, I show that children are able to report threats to authenticity, but that the majority of children are not concerned with such threats. On balance, children report that stimulants improve their capacity for moral agency, and they associate this capacity with an ability to meet normative expectations. I argue that although under certain conditions stimulant drug treatment may increase the risk of a threat to authenticity, there are ways to minimise this risk and to maximise the benefits of stimulant drug treatment. Medical professionals in particular should help children to flourish with stimulant drug treatments, in good and in bad conditions.",0
473,Minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer in UK: current status and future perspectives,"The aim of this study is to review the literature and report the various minimally invasive methods used to treat gastric cancer in the UK and compare it with worldwide practice. Published randomised studies, non-randomised studies and case series reporting the use of minimal invasive approach to treat gastric cancer were retrieved from the search of standard medical electronic databases and their outcomes were highlighted suggesting their effectiveness. Several randomised, controlled trials and meta-analyses have proven the clinical and oncological safety of the laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Similarly, robot-assisted gastrectomy, EMR (endoscopic mucosal resection) and ESD (endoscopic sub-mucosal dissection) have also been proven feasible and safe to treat gastric cancer of various stages in prospective and retrospective comparative studies. However, UK based studies on minimally invasive surgery to treat gastric cancer is scarce and the paucity of trials led to uncertain outcomes. Laparoscopic gastrectomy, robot-assisted gastrectomy, EMR and ESD are feasible procedures in terms of clinical and oncological safety but mainly being practiced in Asian countries with high prevalence of stomach cancer. The UK based practice is still small and limited but the introduction of MIGOCS and STOMACH trial might help to widen the application of this technique.",2
474,Evaluating the use of robotic and virtual reality rehabilitation technologies to improve function in stroke survivors: A narrative review,"This review evaluates the effectiveness of robotic and virtual reality technologies used for neurological rehabilitation in stroke survivors. It examines each rehabilitation technology in turn before considering combinations of these technologies and the complexities of rehabilitation outcome assessment. There is high-quality evidence that upper-limb robotic rehabilitation technologies improve movement, strength and activities of daily living, whilst the evidence for robotic lower-limb rehabilitation is currently not as convincing. Virtual reality technologies also improve activities of daily living. Whilst the benefit of these technologies over dose-controlled conventional rehabilitation is likely to be small, there is a role for both technologies as part of a broader rehabilitation programme, where they may help to increase the intensity and amount of therapy delivered. Combining robotic and virtual reality technologies in a rehabilitation programme may further improve rehabilitation outcomes and we would advocate randomised controlled trials of these technologies in combination.",6
475,Trends and developments in hip and knee arthroplasty technology,"The developments in hip and knee arthroplasty over recent years have aimed to improve outcomes, reduce complications and improve implant survival. This review describes some of the most interesting trends and developments in this important and fast-moving field. Notable developments have included ceramic hip resurfacing, mini hip stems, cementless knee replacement and the wider adoption of the dual mobility articulation for hip arthroplasty. Advances in additive manufacturing and the surface modification of joint replacements offer increasing options for more challenging arthroplasty cases. Robotic assisted surgery is one of the most interesting developments in hip and knee surgery. The recent growth in the use of this technology is providing data that will help determine whether this approach should become the standard of care for hip and knee arthroplasty in the future.",0
476,Designing Futuristic Telemedicine Using Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in the COVID-19 Era,"Technological innovations such as artificial intelligence and robotics may be of potential use in telemedicine and in building capacity to respond to future pandemics beyond the current COVID-19 era. Our international consortium of interdisciplinary experts in clinical medicine, health policy, and telemedicine have identified gaps in uptake and implementation of telemedicine or telehealth across geographics and medical specialties. This paper discusses various artificial intelligence and robotics-assisted telemedicine or telehealth applications during COVID-19 and presents an alternative artificial intelligence assisted telemedicine framework to accelerate the rapid deployment of telemedicine and improve access to quality and cost-effective healthcare. We postulate that the artificial intelligence assisted telemedicine framework would be indispensable in creating futuristic and resilient health systems that can support communities amidst pandemics.",1
477,Possibilities for serial femtosecond crystallography sample delivery at future light sources,"Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) uses X-ray pulses from free-electron laser (FEL) sources that can outrun radiation damage and thereby overcome long-standing limits in the structure determination of macromolecular crystals. Intense X-ray FEL pulses of sufficiently short duration allow the collection of damage-free data at room temperature and give the opportunity to study irreversible time-resolved events. SFX may open the way to determine the structure of biological molecules that fail to crystallize readily into large well-diffracting crystals. Taking advantage of FELs with high pulse repetition rates could lead to short measurement times of just minutes. Automated delivery of sample suspensions for SFX experiments could potentially give rise to a much higher rate of obtaining complete measurements than at today's third generation synchrotron radiation facilities, as no crystal alignment or complex robotic motions are required. This capability will also open up extensive time-resolved structural studies. New challenges arise from the resulting high rate of data collection, and in providing reliable sample delivery. Various developments for fully automated high-throughput SFX experiments are being considered for evaluation, including new implementations for a reliable yet flexible sample environment setup. Here, we review the different methods developed so far that best achieve sample delivery for X-ray FEL experiments and present some considerations towards the goal of high-throughput structure determination with X-ray FELs.",2
478,Robotic total meso-rectal excision for rectal cancer: A systematic review following the publication of the ROLARR trial,"Aim:
        
      
      To compare outcomes in patients undergoing rectal resection by robotic total meso-rectal excision (RTME) vs laparoscopic total meso-rectal excision (LTME).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Standard medical electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus were searched to find relevant articles. The data retrieved from all types of included published comparative trials in patients undergoing RTME vs LTME was analysed using the principles of meta-analysis. The operative, post-operative and oncological outcomes were evaluated to assess the effectiveness of both techniques of TME. The summated outcome of continuous variables was expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and dichotomous data was presented in odds ratio (OR).
    


          Results:
        
      
      One RCT (ROLARR trial) and 27 other comparative studies reporting the non-oncological and oncological outcomes following RTME vs LTME were included in this review. In the random effects model analysis using the statistical software Review Manager 5.3, the RTME was associated with longer operation time (SMD, 0.46; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.67; z = 4.33; P = 0.0001), early passage of first flatus (P = 0.002), lower risk of conversion (P = 0.00001) and shorter hospitalization (P = 0.01). The statistical equivalence was seen between RTME and LTME for non-oncological variables like blood loss, morbidity, mortality and re-operation risk. The oncological variables such as recurrence (P = 0.96), number of harvested nodes (P = 0.49) and positive circumferential resection margin risk (P = 0.53) were also comparable in both groups. The length of distal resection margins was similar in both groups.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RTME is feasible and oncologically safe but failed to demonstrate any superiority over LTME for many surgical outcomes except early passage of flatus, lower risk of conversion and shorter hospitalization.",5
479,Acromioclavicular joint reconstruction implants have differing ability to restore horizontal and vertical plane stability,"Purpose:
        
      
      Persistent acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) instability following high grade injuries causes significant symptoms. The importance of horizontal plane stability is increasingly recognised. There is little evidence of the ability of current implant methods to restore native ACJ stability in the vertical and horizontal planes. The purpose of this work was to measure the ability of three implant reconstructions to restore native ACJ stability.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three groups of nine fresh-frozen shoulders each were mounted into a robotic testing system. The scapula was stationary and the robot displaced the clavicle to measure native anterior, posterior, superior and inferior (A, P, S, I) stability at 50 N force. The ACJ capsule, conoid and trapezoid ligaments were transected and the ACJ was reconstructed using one of three commercially available systems. Two systems (tape loop + screw and tape loop + button) wrapped a tape around the clavicle and coracoid, the third system (sutures + buttons) passed directly through tunnels in the clavicle and coracoid. The stabilities were remeasured. The data for A, P, S, I stability and ranges of A-P and S-I stability were analyzed by ANOVA and repeated-measures Student t tests with Bonferroni correction, to contrast each reconstruction stability versus the native ACJ data for that set of nine specimens, and examined contrasts among the reconstructions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All three reconstructions restored the range of A-P stability to that of the native ACJ. However, the coracoid loop devices shifted the clavicle anteriorly. For S-I stability, only the sutures + buttons reconstruction did not differ significantly from native ligament restraint.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Only the sutures + buttons reconstruction, that passed directly through tunnels in the clavicle and coracoid, restored all stability measures (A, P, S, I) to the native values, while the tape implants wrapped around the bones anteriorised the clavicle. These findings show differing abilities among reconstructions to restore native stability in horizontal and vertical planes. (300 words).",8
480,The Impact of Steep Trendelenburg Position on Intraocular Pressure,"Intraocular pressure occurring during the Trendelenburg position may be a risk for postoperative visual loss and other ocular complications. Intraocular pressure (IOP) higher than 21 mmHg poses a risk for ocular impairment causing several conditions such as glaucoma, detached retina, and postoperative vision loss. Many factors might play a role in IOP increase, like peak expiratory pressure (PIP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and surgical duration and some others (anaesthetic and neuromuscular blockade depth) contribute by reducing IOP during procedures requiring both pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position (25-45° head-down tilt). Despite transient visual field loss after surgery, no signs of ischemia or changes to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) have been shown after surgery. Over the years, several studies have been conducted to control and prevent IOPs intraoperative increase. Multiple strategies have been proposed by different authors over the years to reduce IOP during laparoscopic procedures, especially those involving steep Trendelenburg positions such as robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), and abdominal and pelvic procedures. These strategies included both positional and pharmacological strategies.",2
481,Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Meta-Analytic Findings,"Objective:
        
      
      The present meta-analysis sought to determine significant factors that predict trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Such factors were divided into those relating to (a) the human trustor, (b) the AI trustee, and (c) the shared context of their interaction.
    


          Background:
        
      
      There are many factors influencing trust in robots, automation, and technology in general, and there have been several meta-analytic attempts to understand the antecedents of trust in these areas. However, no targeted meta-analysis has been performed examining the antecedents of trust in AI.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Data from 65 articles examined the three predicted categories, as well as the subcategories of human characteristics and abilities, AI performance and attributes, and contextual tasking. Lastly, four common uses for AI (i.e., chatbots, robots, automated vehicles, and nonembodied, plain algorithms) were examined as further potential moderating factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Results showed that all of the examined categories were significant predictors of trust in AI as well as many individual antecedents such as AI reliability and anthropomorphism, among many others.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Overall, the results of this meta-analysis determined several factors that influence trust, including some that have no bearing on AI performance. Additionally, we highlight the areas where there is currently no empirical research.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Findings from this analysis will allow designers to build systems that elicit higher or lower levels of trust, as they require.",4

483,Doing laboratory ethnography: reflections on method in scientific workplaces,"Laboratory ethnography extended the social scientist's gaze into the day-to-day accomplishment of scientific practice. Here we reflect upon our own ethnographies of biomedical scientific workspaces to provoke methodological discussion on the doing of laboratory ethnography. What we provide is less a 'how to' guide and more a commentary on what to look for and what to look at. We draw upon our empirical research with stem cell laboratories and animal houses, teams producing robotic surgical tools, musicians sonifying data science, a psychiatric genetics laboratory, and scientists developing laboratory grown meat. We use these cases to example a set of potential ethnographic themes worthy of pursuit: science epistemics and the extended laboratory, the interaction order of scientific work, sensory realms and the rending of science as sensible, conferences as performative sites, and the spaces, places and temporalities of scientific work.",0
484,"Risk, Trust, and Bias: Causal Regulators of Biometric-Enabled Decision Support","Biometrics and biometric-enabled decision support systems (DSS) have become a mandatory part of complex dynamic systems such as security checkpoints, personal health monitoring systems, autonomous robots, and epidemiological surveillance. Risk, trust, and bias (R-T-B) are emerging measures of performance of such systems. The existing studies on the R-T-B impact on system performance mostly ignore the complementary nature of R-T-B and their causal relationships, for instance, risk of trust, risk of bias, and risk of trust over biases. This paper offers a complete taxonomy of the R-T-B causal performance regulators for the biometric-enabled DSS. The proposed novel taxonomy links the R-T-B assessment to the causal inference mechanism for reasoning in decision making. Practical details of the R-T-B assessment in the DSS are demonstrated using the experiments of assessing the trust in synthetic biometric and the risk of bias in face biometrics. The paper also outlines the emerging applications of the proposed approach beyond biometrics, including decision support for epidemiological surveillance such as for COVID-19 pandemics.",4
485,Robotic and laparoscopic surgery of the pancreas: an historical review,"Surgery of the pancreas is a relatively new field, with operative series appearing only in the last 50 years. Surgery of the pancreas is technically challenging. The entire field of general surgery changed radically in 1987 with the introduction of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Minimally Invasive surgical techniques rapidly became utilized worldwide for gallbladder surgery and were then adapted to other abdominal operations. These techniques are used regularly for surgery of the pancreas including distal pancreatectomy and pancreatoduodenectomy. The progression from open surgery to laparoscopy to robotic surgery has occurred for many operations including adrenalectomy, thyroidectomy, colon resection, prostatectomy, gastrectomy and others. Data to show a benefit to the patient are scarce for robotic surgery, although both laparoscopic and robotic surgery of the pancreas have been shown not to be inferior with regard to major operative and oncologic outcomes. While there were serious concerns when laparoscopy was first used in patients with malignancies, robotic surgery has been used in many benign and malignant conditions with no obvious deterioration of outcomes. Robotic surgery for malignancies of the pancreas is well accepted and expanding to more centers. The importance of centers of excellence, surgeon experience supported by a codified mastery-based training program and international registries is widely accepted. Robotic pancreatic surgery is associated with slightly decreased blood loss and decreased length of stay compared to open surgery. Major oncologic outcomes appear to have been preserved, with some studies showing higher rates of R0 resection and tumor-free margins. Patients with lesions of the pancreas should find a surgeon they trust and do not need to be concerned with the operative approach used for their resection. The step-wise approach that has characterized the growth in robotic surgery of the pancreas, in contradistinction to the frenzy that accompanied the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, has allowed the identification of areas for improvement, many of which lie at the junction of engineering and medical practice. Refinements in robotic surgery depend on a partnership between engineers and clinicians.",3
486,Evaluating the role of the self-assembling topical haemostat PuraBond® in Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal cancer: A case series,"Background:
        
      
      Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) has been increasingly employed in head and neck surgery for the assessment and treatment of malignancies over the last two decades. PuraBond® is a self-assembling viscous solution that forms a transparent hydrogel 3-D matrix to promote local haemostasis. This study aimed to assess the utility of PuraBond® in patients undergoing TORS for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All patients who underwent TORS with PuraBond® between October 2021-May 2022 at a single tertiary university hospital in the United Kingdom were included. Primary outcome measures included post-operative haemorrhage rate (primary; within 24hrs of surgery, secondary; 1-30 days post-surgery). Secondary outcome measures included, Length Of hospital Stay (LOS), swallowing complications, hospital re-admission, and surgeon-reported ease of PuraBond® application.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve patients were included (13 procedures due to one second look and re-resection case). No patients developed primary or secondary post-operative haemorrhage. There were no re-attendances within 30 days. Average LOS was 2.78 days (range: 1.54-4.31 days). No patient required feeding tube insertion or tracheostomy. In all procedures, the use of PuraBond® was reported as 'easy'.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the first study to evaluate the role of PuraBond® in TORS. The wide range of favourable outcomes reported support its safety and efficacy. The current findings mandate the need for larger, prospective, controlled studies to better define whether the known haemostatic and regenerative properties of PuraBond® may translate into direct patient benefit in the expanding field of TORS for HPV-mediated OPSCC.",1

488,Meta-analysis with individual data of functional outcomes following Aquablation for lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH in various prostate anatomies,"Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate functional outcomes following Aquablation in various prostate volume and anatomical subgroups.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A meta-analysis with individual patient data undergoing Aquablation therapy from four prospective, global, clinical studies that have been conducted with Aquablation; WATER, WATER II, FRANCAIS WATER and OPEN WATER.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Australia, Canada, Lebanon, Germany, New Zealand, UK and the USA.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      425 men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with 1-year follow-up.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Aquablation therapy is an ultrasound guided, robotically executed waterjet ablative procedure for the prostate.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The analyses focus International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), uroflowmetry, postoperative Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) and surgical retreatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      425 men with prostates ranging in size from 20 to 150 mL underwent Aquablation therapy. The outcomes from the seven questions in the IPSS questionnaire were grouped by the following; prostates <100 mL, prostates ≥100 mL, prostate anatomy with an obstructive median lobe identifed by imaging, and prostate anatomy without an obstructive median lobe. Regardless of subgroup, all outcomes are consistent and demonstrate a significant improvement from baseline. Specifically, improvements in frequency, urgency and nocturia demonstrated bladder function improvement. Patients entering treatment with severe incontinence, ISI score >4, and regardless of prostate size, showed a reduction in incontinence during patient follow-up. Surgical retreatment due to BPH symptoms occurred in 0.7% (95% CI 0.1%-2.0%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Across a variety of prostate anatomies, Aquablation therapy showed remarkable functional improvements following the index procedure. Additionally, men with moderate to severe LUTS/BPH and overactive bladder resulting in urge incontinence showed a reduction in incontinence symptoms postprocedure.",2
489,Pedestrian Trust in Automated Vehicles: Role of Traffic Signal and AV Driving Behavior,"Pedestrians' acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs) depends on their trust in the AVs. We developed a model of pedestrians' trust in AVs based on AV driving behavior and traffic signal presence. To empirically verify this model, we conducted a human-subject study with 30 participants in a virtual reality environment. The study manipulated two factors: AV driving behavior (defensive, normal, and aggressive) and the crosswalk type (signalized and unsignalized crossing). Results indicate that pedestrians' trust in AVs was influenced by AV driving behavior as well as the presence of a signal light. In addition, the impact of the AV's driving behavior on trust in the AV depended on the presence of a signal light. There were also strong correlations between trust in AVs and certain observable trusting behaviors such as pedestrian gaze at certain areas/objects, pedestrian distance to collision, and pedestrian jaywalking time. We also present implications for design and future research.",4
490,Multi-device trust transfer: Can trust be transferred among multiple devices?,"Recent advances in automation technology have increased the opportunity for collaboration between humans and multiple autonomous systems such as robots and self-driving cars. In research on autonomous system collaboration, the trust users have in autonomous systems is an important topic. Previous research suggests that the trust built by observing a task can be transferred to other tasks. However, such research did not focus on trust in multiple different devices but in one device or several of the same devices. Thus, we do not know how trust changes in an environment involving the operation of multiple different devices such as a construction site. We investigated whether trust can be transferred among multiple different devices, and investigated the effect of two factors: the similarity among multiple devices and the agency attributed to each device, on trust transfer among multiple devices. We found that the trust a user has in a device can be transferred to other devices and that attributing different agencies to each device can clarify the distinction among devices, preventing trust from transferring.",4
491,The spread of true and false news online,"We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.",6
492,Differences in trends in the use of robot-assisted and open radical cystectomy and changes over time in peri-operative outcomes among selected centres in North America and Europe: an international multicentre collaboration,"Objectives:
        
      
      To compare trends in the use of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and changes over time in peri-operative outcomes in selected North American and European centres.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 2401 patients treated with open radical cystectomy (ORC) or RARC for bladder cancer at 12 centres in North America and Europe between 2006 and 2018. We used the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-squared test to evaluate differences between continuous and categorical variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 49.5% of patients underwent RARC and 51.5% ORC. RARC became the most commonly performed procedure in contemporary patients, with an increase from 29% in 2006-2008 to 54% in 2015-2018 (P < 0.001). In the North American centres the use of RARC was higher than that of ORC from 2006, and remained stable over time, whereas in the European centres its use increased exponentially from 2% to 50%. In both groups patients who underwent RARC had less advanced T stages (P < 0.001), lower American Society of Anesthesiologists scores (P < 0.05), lower blood loss (P = 0.001) and shorter length of hospital stay (P < 0.05). No differences were found in early complications. Early readmission and re-operation rates were worse for patients treated with RARC in the European centres; however, when contemporary patients only were considered, the statistical significance was lost.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The present study shows that the use of RARC has constantly increased since its introduction, overtaking ORC in the most contemporary series. While RARC was more frequently performed than ORC since its introduction in the North American centres and its use remained substantially stable over time, its use increased exponentially in the European centres. The different trends in use of RARC/ORC and changes over time in peri-operative outcomes between the North American and European centres can be attributed to the earlier introduction and spread of RARC in the former compared with the latter.",2

494,Prostatectomy: information provision and education for patients,"Following the diagnosis of prostate cancer, information should be imparted to ensure an informed decision regarding treatment can be made. The impact of a cancer diagnosis could lead men to opt for surgical intervention without fully understanding the consequences of treatment. Effective communication of evidence-based information can assist men to fully understand the consequences of treatment. Radical prostatectomy, whether robotically assisted laparoscopic or retropubic, will lead to quality-of-life issues with functional outcomes such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence being at the forefront. Issues should be discussed and communicated in depth so that frustration and regret following treatment are avoided. A cautious approach to information provision should be considered so the patient does not feel in a position of information overload. Advanced communication skills are of utmost importance to ensure information is tailored to suit individual needs, as no one model of information giving suits all. This article is a rapid literature search relating to post-prostatectomy functional outcomes and how communication and information giving before treatment assists with acceptance of treatment outcomes.",2
495,Minimally invasive right colectomy anastomosis study (MIRCAST): protocol for an observational cohort study of surgical complications using four surgical techniques for anastomosis in patients with a right colon tumor,"Background:
        
      
      Right colectomy is the standard surgical treatment for tumors in the right colon and surgical complications are reduced with minimally-invasive laparoscopy compared with open surgery, with potential further benefits achieved with robotic assistance. The anastomotic technique used can also have an impact on patient outcomes. However, there are no large, prospective studies that have compared all techniques.
    


          Methods/design:
        
      
      MIRCAST is the Minimally-Invasive Right Colectomy Anastomosis Study that will compare laparoscopy with robot-assisted surgery, using either intracorporeal or extracorporeal anastomosis, in a large prospective, observational, multicenter, parallel, four-cohort study in patients with a benign or malignant, non-metastatic tumor of the right colon. Over 2 years of follow-up, the study will prospectively evaluate peri- and postoperative complications, postoperative recovery, hospital stay, and mid-term results including survival, local recurrence, metastases rate, and conversion rate. The primary composite endpoint will be the efficacy of the surgical method regarding surgical wound infections and postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV complications at 30 days post-surgery). Secondary endpoints include long-term oncologic results, conversion rate, operative time, length of stay, and quality of life.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This will be the first large, international study to prospectively evaluate the use of minimally-invasive laparoscopy or robot-assisted surgery during right hemicolectomy and to control for the impact of the anastomotic technique. The research will contribute to current knowledge regarding the medical care of patients with malignant or benign tumors of the right colon, and enable physicians to determine which technique may be the most appropriate for their patients.

496,Current Status of Simulation and Training Models in Urological Surgery: A Systematic Review,"Purpose:
        
      
      Increased awareness of patient safety, advances in surgical technology and reduced working times have led to the adoption of simulation enhanced training. However, the simulators available need to be scientifically evaluated before integration into curricula. We identify the currently available training models for urological surgery, their status of validation and the evidence behind each model.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE®, Embase® and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for English language articles published between 1990 and 2015 describing urological simulators and/or validation studies of these models. All studies were assessed for level of evidence, and each model was subsequently awarded a level of recommendation using a modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine classification, adapted for education by the European Association of Endoscopic Surgeons.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 91 validation studies were identified pertaining to training models in endourology (63), laparoscopic surgery (17), robot-assisted surgery (8) and open urological surgery (6), with a total of 55 models. Of the included studies 6 were classified Level 1b, 9 Level 2a, 39 Level 2b and 19 Level 2c. Of all the training models the URO Mentor™ was the only one to receive a level of recommendation of 1.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      UroSimulation is a growing field and increasing numbers of models are being produced. However, there are still too few validation studies with a high level of evidence demonstrating the transferability of skills. Nevertheless, efforts should be made to use the currently available models in curriculum based training programs.",3
497,Haptic Guidance Based on All-Optical Ultrasound Distance Sensing for Safer Minimally Invasive Fetal Surgery,"By intervening during the early stage of gestation, fetal surgeons aim to correct or minimize the effects of congenital disorders. As compared to postnatal treatment of these disorders, such early interventions can often actually save the life of the fetus and also improve the quality of life of the newborn. However, fetal surgery is considered one of the most challenging disciplines within Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), owing to factors such as the fragility of the anatomic features, poor visibility, limited manoeuvrability, and extreme requirements in terms of instrument handling with precise positioning. This work is centered on a fetal laser surgery procedure treating placental disorders. It proposes the use of haptic guidance to enhance the overall safety of this procedure and to simplify instrument handling. A method is described that provides effective guidance by installing a forbidden region virtual fixture over the placenta, thereby safeguarding adequate clearance between the instrument tip and the placenta. With a novel application of all-optical ultrasound distance sensing in which transmission and reception are performed with fibre optics, this method can be used with a sole reliance on intraoperatively acquired data. The added value of the guidance approach, in terms of safety and performance, is demonstrated in a series of experiments with a robotic platform.",0
498,Using preoperative imaging for intraoperative guidance: a case of mistaken identity,"Background:
        
      
      Surgical image guidance systems to date have tended to rely on reconstructions of preoperative datasets. This paper assesses the accuracy of these reconstructions to establish whether they are appropriate for use in image guidance platforms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nine raters (two experts in image interpretation and preparation, three in image interpretation, and four in neither interpretation nor preparation) were asked to perform a segmentation of ten renal tumours (four cystic and six solid tumours). These segmentations were compared with a gold standard consensus segmentation generated using a previously validated algorithm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Average sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 0.902 and 0.891, respectively. When assessing for variability between raters, significant differences were seen in the PPV, sensitivity and incursions and excursions from consensus tumour boundary.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This paper has demonstrated that the interpretation required for the segmentation of preoperative imaging of renal tumours introduces significant inconsistency and inaccuracy. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1

A systematic review relating to literature on impact of preoperative PFE on continence outcomes for patients undergoing prostatectomy was conducted. The search strategy aimed to identify all references related to pelvic floor exercises and post-prostatectomy. Search terms used were as follows: (Pelvic floor exercises) AND (incontinence) AND (prostatectomy). The following databases were screened from 2000 to September 2017: CINAHL, MEDLINE (NHS Evidence), Cochrane, AMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science. In addition, searches using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords were conducted using Cochrane databases. Two UK-based experts in prostate cancer and robotic surgery were consulted to identify any additional studies. In the 6 months following surgery, the continence rates, as defined by the use of one pad or less per day, were 94% (44 of 47) and 96% (48 of 50) in the PFE and biofeedback groups and control groups (PFE alone), respectively (P = 0.596) (Bales et al. in Urology 56: 627-630, 2000). This demonstrates preoperative PFE may improve early continence after RP. Geraerts et al. (Eur Urol 64:766-772, 2013) demonstrated the ""incontinence impact"" was in favour of a group with PFE at 3 and 6 months after surgery. This demonstrates again the advantage of preoperative PFE. Cornel et al. [World J Urol 23:353-355, 2005] determined the benefit of starting pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFE) 30 days before RP and of continuing PFE postoperatively for early recovery of continence as part of a randomised, prospective study (Moher quality A). This demonstrated preoperative PFE may improve early continence and QoL outcomes after RP. Post-prostatectomy incontinence is a bothersome complication of radical prostatectomy [Chughtai et al. in Rev Urol 15:61-66, 2013]. Weak pelvic floor muscles compromised normal pelvic floor function and led to urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles was shown to significantly improve post-prostatectomy urinary continence, post-micturition dribble and erectile function. It would be prudent for all men to exercise their pelvic floor muscles to maintain normal pelvic floor function and start prior to surgery.",2
500,Video labelling robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and the role of artificial intelligence (AI): training a novice,"Video labelling is the assigning of meaningful information to raw videos. With the evolution of artificial intelligence and its intended incorporation into the operating room, video datasets can be invaluable tools for education and the training of intelligent surgical workflow systems through computer vision. However, the process of manual labelling of video datasets can prove costly and time-consuming for already busy practising surgeons. Twenty-five robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) procedures were recorded on Proximie, an augmented reality platform, anonymised and access given to a novice, who was trained to develop the knowledge and skills needed to accurately segment a full-length RARP procedure on a video labelling platform. A labelled video was subsequently randomly selected for assessment of accuracy by four practising urologists. Of the 25 videos allocated, 17 were deemed suitable for labelling, and 8 were excluded on the basis of procedure length and video quality. The labelled video selected for assessment was graded for accuracy of temporal labelling, with an average score of 93.1%, and a range of 85.6-100%. The self-training of a novice in the accurate segmentation of a surgical video to the standard of a practising urologist is feasible and practical for the RARP procedure. The assigning of temporal labels on a video labelling platform was also studied and proved feasible throughout the study period.",3
501,The reliability and transparency bases of trust in human-swarm interaction: principles and implications,"Automation reliability and transparency are key factors for trust calibration and as such can have distinct effects on human reliance behaviour and mission performance. One question that remains unexplored is: what are the implications of reliability and transparency on trust calibration for human-swarm interaction? We investigate this research question in the context of human-swarm interaction, as swarm systems are becoming more popular for their robustness and versatility. Thirty-two participants performed swarm-based tasks under different reliability and transparency conditions. The results indicate that trust, whether it is reliability- or transparency-based, indicates high reliance rates and shorter response times. Reliability-based trust is negatively correlated with correct rejection rates while transparency-based trust is positively correlated with these rates. We conclude that reliability and transparency have distinct effects on trust calibration. Practitioner Summary: Reliability and transparency have distinct effects on trust calibration. Findings from our human experiments suggest that transparency is a necessary design requirement if and when humans need to be involved in the decision-loop of human-swarm systems, especially when swarm reliability is high.

502,Artificial intelligence and the future of midwifery: What do midwives think about artificial intelligence? A qualitative study,"The evidence on how AI will make a revolution is insufficient. Our aim was to investigate opinions of midwives on the future of AI and midwifery. Semi-structured interviews were done with 18 midwives in Turkey. Themes were identified: expectations included the advantages and conditional acceptance of robotic technology, prejudices reflected perceived shortcomings, lack of human competencies, and trust issues. Concerns included midwifery care and concerns about her future. Midwives were overwhelmingly skeptical about the replacement of human capabilities by AI and found the technology's potential limited.",4
503,Outcomes After Minimally Invasive Versus Open Total Pancreatectomy: A Pan-European Propensity Score Matched Study,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess postoperative 90-day outcomes after minimally invasive (laparoscopic/robot-assisted) total pancreatectomy (MITP) in selected patients versus open total pancreatectomy (OTP) among European centers.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive pancreatic surgery is becoming increasingly popular but data on MITP are scarce and multicenter studies comparing outcomes versus OTP are lacking. It therefore remains unclear if MITP is a valid alternative.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Multicenter retrospective propensity-score matched study including consecutive adult patients undergoing MITP or OTP for all indications at 16 European centers in 7 countries (2008-2017). Patients after MITP were matched (1:1, caliper 0.02) to OTP controls. Missing data were imputed. The primary outcome was 90-day major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥3a). Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 361 patients (99 MITP/262 OTP), 70 MITP procedures (50 laparoscopic, 15 robotic, 5 hybrid) could be matched to 70 OTP controls. After matching, MITP was associated with a lower rate of major morbidity (17% MITP vs 31% OTP, P = 0.022). The 90-day mortality (1.4% MITP vs 7.1% OTP, P = 0.209) and median hospital stay (17 [IQR 11-24] MITP vs 12 [10-23] days OTP, P = 0.876) did not differ significantly. Among 81 patients with PDAC, overall survival was 3.7 (IQR 1.7-N/A) vs 0.9 (IQR 0.5-N/A) years, for MITP vs OTP, which was non-significant after stratification by T-stage.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This international propensity score matched study showed that MITP may be a valuable alternative to OTP in selected patients, given the associated lower rate of major morbidity.",2
504,Motor and sensory disturbances induced by sensorimotor conflicts during passive and active movements in healthy participants,"Sensorimotor conflict induces both sensory and motor disturbances, but the specific factors playing a role in conflict-induced disturbances are still misunderstood. For example, we still do not know the role played by motor intention (vs. a purely visuo-proprioceptive conflict) or the influence of specific types of incongruent visual feedback. The objective of this study was threefold: 1- to compare the effect of passive and active movement during sensorimotor conflict on sensory disturbances measured with a questionnaire; 2- to compare the effect of three incongruent visual feedback conditions on sensory and motor (mediolateral drift and movement amplitude) disturbances; 3- to test whether conflict-induced sensory and motor disturbances were stable over time. 20 healthy participants realized active or passive cyclic upper limb movements while viewing either congruent or incongruent visual feedback about their movement using a robotized exoskeleton combined with 2D virtual reality interface. First, results showed that in condition of conflict, participants reported higher sensory disturbances during active movements compared to passive movements (p = 0.034), suggesting that the efference copy reinforces the conflict between vision and proprioception. Second, the three conditions of incongruence in the active condition induced similar sensory (all p>0.45) and motor disturbances (medio-lateral drift: all p>0.59 and amplitude: all p>0.25), suggesting that conflict induced motor disturbances could be related more to the observation of another movement rather than to a detection of conflict between motor intention and sensory feedback. Finally, both sensory and motor disturbances were stable over time (all ICCs between 0.76 and 0.87), demonstrating low variability within participants. Overall, our results suggest that the efference copy is more involved in sensory disturbances than in motor disturbances, suggesting that they might rely on independent processes.",6

506,Predictors of upgrading from low-grade cancer at prostatectomy in men with biparametric magnetic resonance imaging,"Introduction:
        
      
      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density has previously been identified as a predictor of histological upgrading at radical prostatectomy, but how information from pre-treatment biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) contributes needs further clarification. The objective of this register-based study was to identify predictors of upgrading at prostatectomy in men with Grade group (GG) 1 and pre-treatment bpMRI.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      This single-center study included men with GG 1 cancer on prediagnostic biopsy, who underwent bpMRI and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) between March 2014 and September 2019. We estimated logistic regression models to explore predictors for upgrading. The explored potential predictors were age, PSA density, tumor stage and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score (dichotomised 1-3 versus 4-5).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Upgrading was observed in 56% (73/130) of the men. PSA density was the only significant predictor for upgrading (unadjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2; 2.4 adjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2; 2.5). The probability of upgrading was lower for men with a PIRADS 1-3 than for PIRADS 4-5, but the difference was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2; 1.1, p = 0.082). Among men with PI-RADS 1-3, the probability increased with increasing PSA density (p = 0.036). With PI-RADS 4-5 the probability of upgrading was high over the entire PSA density range.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PSA density is a clinically important factor to predict upgrading from GG1 when bpMRI shows PI-RADS 1-3. In men with PI-RADS 4-5 on bpMRI, the probability of an undetected GG 2-5 cancer is high regardless of the PSA density.",5
507,Exchanging implements: the micro-materialities of multidisciplinary work in the operating theatre,"Surgical procedures rely upon an array of commonplace tools, implements and materials that mediate practice and disciplinary collaboration within the operating theatre. Substantial time is dedicated to the issue and provision of these artefacts and their timely exchange is critical to the successful accomplishment of surgical procedures. In this article, we consider the practice, knowledge and agency that informs how particular implements and materials are passed by the scrub nurse to the surgeon that in turn enables their deployment with regard to the particular procedure and the contingencies 'at hand'. We address the technicalities of these 'non-technical skills' and examine how they rely upon a disciplinary vision and interactional organisation that informs both the scrutiny of action and the ways in which implements and materials are handled and exchanged. We explore the implications of our analysis for our understanding of agency in action and the growing interest in developing robots or autonomous agents to support work and collaboration in health care.",3
508,Minimally Invasive Repair of Recurrent Inguinal Hernia: Multi-Institutional Retrospective Comparison of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Surgery,"Introduction: Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in general surgery. Despite surgical advances, recurrence and chronic pain are still major issues after this intervention. Aim of our study was to retrospectively assess and compare outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic repair of recurrent inguinal hernia. Methods: All patients who underwent recurrent inguinal hernia repair between 2014 and 2021 in five different institutions were included in our study. Baseline data on age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking habit, and anticoagulant therapy were retrospectively collected from prospectively maintained databases. Operative time, length of stay, and early and late complications were compared between the robotic and the laparoscopic approach. Results: Forty-eight patients underwent recurrent inguinal hernia repair between January 2014 and December 2021. Twenty-three patients underwent a robotic procedure, whereas 25 were submitted to the laparoscopic intervention. Overall mean follow-up was 26.2 months. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two groups. Acceptable and comparable rates of peri- and postoperative outcomes were recorded. However, postoperative visual analog scale score and incidence of chronic pain were lower after the robotic rather than after the laparoscopic approach. (2.9 versus 3.8 P = .002; 20% versus 0%; P = .02, respectively). Conclusions: Minimally invasive repair of recurrent inguinal hernia is safe and feasible; robotic surgery is associated with low rate of postoperative and chronic pain without a significant increase in operative time.",9
509,Internal Models in Biological Control,"Rationality principles such as optimal feedback control and Bayesian inference underpin a probabilistic framework that has accounted for a range of empirical phenomena in biological sensorimotor control. To facilitate the optimization of flexible and robust behaviors consistent with these theories, the ability to construct internal models of the motor system and environmental dynamics can be crucial. In the context of this theoretic formalism, we review the computational roles played by such internal models and the neural and behavioral evidence for their implementation in the brain.",4
510,Dosimetric accuracy of delivering SBRT using dynamic arcs on Cyberknife,"Purpose:
        
      
      Several studies have demonstrated potential improvements in treatment time through the use of dynamic arcs for delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on Cyberknife. However, the delivery system has a finite accuracy, so that potential exists for dosimetric uncertainties. This study estimates the expected dosimetric accuracy of dynamic delivery of SBRT, based on realistic estimates of the uncertainties in delivery parameters.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Five SBRT patient cases (prostate A - conventional, prostate B - brachytherapy-type, lung, liver, partial left breast) were retrospectively studied. Treatment plans were produced for a fixed arc trajectory using fluence optimization, segmentation, and direct aperture optimization. Dose rate uncertainty was modeled as a smoothly varying random fluctuation of ± 1.0%, ±2.0% or ± 5.0% over a time period of 10, 30 or 60 s. Multileaf collimator uncertainty was modeled as a lag in position of each leaf up to 0.25 or 0.5 mm. Robot pointing error was modeled as a shift of the target location, with the direction of the shift chosen as a random angle with respect to the multileaf collimator and with a random magnitude in the range 0.0-1.0 mm at the delivery nodes and with an additional random magnitude of 0.5-1.0 mm in between the delivery nodes. The impact of the errors was investigated using dose-volume histograms.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Uncertainty in dose rate has the effect of varying the total monitor units delivered, which in turn produces a variation in mean dose to the planning target volume. The random sampling of dose rate error produces a distribution of mean doses with a standard deviation proportional to the magnitude of the dose rate uncertainty. A lag in multileaf collimator position of 0.25 or 0.5 mm produces a small impact on the delivered dose. In general, an increase in the PTV mean dose of around 1% is observed. An error in robot pointing of the order of 1 mm produces a small increase in dose inhomogeneity to the planning target volume, sometimes accompanied by an increase in mean dose by around 1%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Based upon the limited data available on the dose rate stability and geometric accuracy of the Cyberknife system, this study estimates that dynamic arc delivery can be accomplished with sufficient accuracy for clinical application. Dose rate variation produces a change in dose to the planning target volume according to the perturbation of total monitor units delivered, while multileaf collimator lag and robot pointing error typically increase the mean dose to the planning target volume by up to 1%.",0
511,"Retropubic, Laparoscopic, and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Analysis of the Surgical Outcomes in a Single Regional Center","Background:
        
      
      To compare the surgical outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) performed via 3 different approaches: retropubic (RRP), laparoscopic-assisted (LRP), and robot-assisted (RARP), in a single non-academic regional center by a single surgeon.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The data of patients undergoing RP from 2005 to 2014 were reviewed. The standard approach changed through the years: RRP (n = 380, years 2005 to 2008), LRP (n = 240, years 2009 to 2011), and RARP (n = 262, years 2012 to 2014). Our analysis included the last consecutive 100 RP for each surgical technique by a single surgeon. A logistic regression model adjusted for pre-and postoperative variables was done to evaluate whether transfusion, conversion, and post-operative complication rates were influenced by the approach.
    


          Results:
        
      
      RARP was associated with significantly lower blood loss (400 vs. 600 and 600 ml, respectively), transfusion (6 vs. 21 and 21%, respectively), and shorter hospital stay (6 vs. 7 and 8 days, respectively), compared to LRP and RRP, and a lower conversion rate (1 vs. 12%) compared to LRP. Multivariate analysis adjusted for confounders confirmed that the risk of transfusion and conversion was significantly lower in the RARP group compared to the LRP and RRP groups. The RARP group was also associated with a significantly lower risk of complications compared to the RRP group and with a trend in favor of the RARP group compared to the LRP group. The 1-year continence rate was significantly higher in the RARP group compared to the RRP and LRP groups (80 vs. 72 and 68%, respectively).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The surgical approach affected the operative outcomes in a regional setting. The advantages of RARP over RRP (complications, transfusion, conversion, hospital stay, 1-year continence) were over LRP as well, with the only exception being complications.",5
512,Robotic Living Donor Right Hepatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The introduction of robotics in living donor liver transplantation has been revolutionary. We aimed to examine the safety of robotic living donor right hepatectomy (RLDRH) compared to open (ODRH) and laparoscopic (LADRH) approaches. A systematic review was carried out in Medline and six additional databases following PRISMA guidelines. Data on morbidity, postoperative liver function, and pain in donors and recipients were extracted from studies comparing RLDRH, ODRH, and LADRH published up to September 2020; PROSPERO (CRD42020214313). Dichotomous variables were pooled as risk ratios and continuous variables as weighted mean differences. Four studies with a total of 517 patients were included. In living donors, the postoperative total bilirubin level (MD: -0.7 95%CI -1.0, -0.4), length of hospital stay (MD: -0.8 95%CI -1.4, -0.3), Clavien-Dindo complications I-II (RR: 0.5 95%CI 0.2, 0.9), and pain score at day &gt; 3 (MD: -0.6 95%CI -1.6, 0.4) were lower following RLDRH compared to ODRH. Furthermore, the pain score at day &gt; 3 (MD: -0.4 95%CI -0.8, -0.09) was lower after RLDRH when compared to LADRH. In recipients, the postoperative AST level was lower (MD: -0.5 95%CI -0.9, -0.1) following RLDRH compared to ODRH. Moreover, the length of stay (MD: -6.4 95%CI -11.3, -1.5) was lower after RLDRH when compared to LADRH. In summary, we identified low- to unclear-quality evidence that RLDRH seems to be safe and feasible for adult living donor liver transplantation compared to the conventional approaches. No postoperative deaths were reported.",5
513,Evidence for robots,"Robots have been successfully used in commercial industry and have enabled humans to perform tasks which are repetitive, dangerous and requiring extreme force. Their role has evolved and now includes many aspects of surgery to improve safety and precision. Orthopaedic surgery is largely performed on bones which are rigid immobile structures which can easily be performed by robots with great precision. Robots have been designed for use in orthopaedic surgery including joint arthroplasty and spine surgery. Experimental studies have been published evaluating the role of robots in arthroscopy and trauma surgery. In this article, we will review the incorporation of robots in orthopaedic surgery looking into the evidence in their use.",1
514,Technology-based interventions for mental health support after stroke: A systematic review of their acceptability and feasibility,"Mental health disturbances are common after stroke and linked to a slower recovery. Current face-to-face treatment options are costly and often inaccessible. Technology advances have made it possible to overcome some of these barriers to deliver technology-based mental health interventions remotely, but we do not know how acceptable and feasible they are. This systematic review aims to provide an examination of the acceptability and feasibility of technology-based mental health interventions provided to stroke patients and evaluate any barriers to their adoption. A total of 13 studies were included investigating interventions targeting non-specific mental health, depression or anxiety. The delivery technologies were: video conferencing, computer programmes, telephones, DVDs, CDs, robot-assisted devices, and personal digital assistants. Rates of refusal to participate were low (7.9-25%). Where satisfaction was reported, this was generally high. Many studies achieved high levels of adherence (up to 89.6%). This was lower for some technologies (e.g., robotic assistive devices). Where dropout occurred, this was for reasons including a decline in health as well as technical difficulties. Overall, the literature displays early evidence of using technology to deliver mental health interventions to patients with stroke. This review has identified factors that the design of future studies should take into consideration.",6
515,Spotsizer: High-throughput quantitative analysis of microbial growth,"Microbial colony growth can serve as a useful readout in assays for studying complex genetic interactions or the effects of chemical compounds. Although computational tools for acquiring quantitative measurements of microbial colonies have been developed, their utility can be compromised by inflexible input image requirements, non-trivial installation procedures, or complicated operation. Here, we present the Spotsizer software tool for automated colony size measurements in images of robotically arrayed microbial colonies. Spotsizer features a convenient graphical user interface (GUI), has both single-image and batch-processing capabilities, and works with multiple input image formats and different colony grid types. We demonstrate how Spotsizer can be used for high-throughput quantitative analysis of fission yeast growth. The user-friendly Spotsizer tool provides rapid, accurate, and robust quantitative analyses of microbial growth in a high-throughput format. Spotsizer is freely available at https://data.csiro.au/dap/landingpage?pid=csiro:15330 under a proprietary CSIRO license.",7
516,An Assistive Coughing Device for Post-Laryngectomy Patients,"People who have undergone total laryngectomy typically have difficulties speaking and coughing. Coughing, the protective reflex action where air is rapidly expelled from the lungs to clear the airway, is crucial in everyday life. Insufficiency in coughing can lead to serious chest infections. In this research we present a bionic assistive coughing device (RoboCough) to improve coughing efficacy among laryngectomy patients by increasing pressure and flow rate. RoboCough was designed to mimic the function of the glottis and trachea in the upper respiratory system. Experimental results show a significant increase (t(64) = 4.9, p < 0.0001) in peak cough flow rate and peak cough pressure (t(64) = 12.6, p < 0.0001) among 33 control participants using RoboCough. A pilot study with a smaller cohort of laryngectomy patients shows improvement in peak cough pressure (p = 0.0159) using RoboCough. Preliminary results also show that post-laryngectomy coughs achieved similar peak cough flow (Z = -0.9933, p = 0.32) to the control group's natural cough. Coughing capabilities could be improved through using RoboCough. Applications of RoboCough include simulation of vocal folds and respiratory conditions, rehabilitation of ineffective coughs from laryngeal and respiratory diseases and as a test-bed for the development of medical devices for respiratory support.",1
517,"Development and validity evidence of an objective structured assessment of technical skills score for minimally invasive linear-stapled, hand-sewn intestinal anastomoses: the A-OSATS score","Introduction:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to develop a reliable objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) score for linear-stapled, hand-sewn closure of enterotomy intestinal anastomoses (A-OSATS).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The Delphi methodology was used to create a traditional and weighted A-OSATS score highlighting the more important steps for patient outcomes according to an international expert consensus. Minimally invasive novices, intermediates, and experts were asked to perform a minimally invasive linear-stapled intestinal anastomosis with hand-sewn closure of the enterotomy in a live animal model either laparoscopically or robot-assisted. Video recordings were scored by two blinded raters assessing intrarater and interrater reliability and discriminative abilities between novices (n = 8), intermediates (n = 24), and experts (n = 8).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The Delphi process included 18 international experts and was successfully completed after 4 rounds. A total of 4 relevant main steps as well as 15 substeps were identified and a definition of each substep was provided. A maximum of 75 points could be reached in the unweighted A-OSATS score and 170 points in the weighted A-OSATS score respectively. A total of 41 anastomoses were evaluated. Excellent intrarater (r = 0.807-0.988, p < 0.001) and interrater (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.923-0.924, p < 0.001) reliability was demonstrated. Both versions of the A-OSATS correlated well with the general OSATS and discriminated between novices, intermediates, and experts defined by their OSATS global rating scale.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      With the weighted and unweighted A-OSATS score, we propose a new reliable standard to assess the creation of minimally invasive linear-stapled, hand-sewn anastomoses based on an international expert consensus. Validity evidence in live animal models is provided in this study. Future research should focus on assessing whether the weighted A-OSATS exceeds the predictive capabilities of patient outcomes of the unweighted A-OSATS and provide further validity evidence on using the score on different anastomotic techniques in humans.",3
518,Minimally invasive liver resection for huge (≥10 cm) tumors: an international multicenter matched cohort study with regression discontinuity analyses,"Background:
        
      
      The application and feasibility of minimally invasive liver resection (MILR) for huge liver tumours (≥10 cm) has not been well documented.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective analysis of data on 6,617 patients who had MILR for liver tumours were gathered from 21 international centers between 2009-2019. Huge tumors and large tumors were defined as tumors with a size ≥10.0 cm and 3.0-9.9 cm based on histology, respectively. 1:1 coarsened exact-matching (CEM) and 1:2 Mahalanobis distance-matching (MDM) was performed according to clinically-selected variables. Regression discontinuity analyses were performed as an additional line of sensitivity analysis to estimate local treatment effects at the 10-cm tumor size cutoff.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 2,890 patients with tumours ≥3 cm, there were 205 huge tumors. After 1:1 CEM, 174 huge tumors were matched to 174 large tumors; and after 1:2 MDM, 190 huge tumours were matched to 380 large tumours. There was significantly and consistently increased intraoperative blood loss, frequency in the application of Pringle maneuver, major morbidity and postoperative stay in the huge tumour group compared to the large tumour group after both 1:1 CEM and 1:2 MDM. These findings were reinforced in RD analyses. Intraoperative blood transfusion rate and open conversion rate were significantly higher in the huge tumor group after only 1:2 MDM but not 1:1 CEM.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      MILR for huge tumours can be safely performed in expert centers It is an operation with substantial complexity and high technical requirement, with worse perioperative outcomes compared to MILR for large tumors, therefore judicious patient selection is pivotal.",9
519,"Gentle, fast and effective crystal soaking by acoustic dispensing","The steady expansion in the capacity of modern beamlines for high-throughput data collection, enabled by increasing X-ray brightness, capacity of robotics and detector speeds, has pushed the bottleneck upstream towards sample preparation. Even in ligand-binding studies using crystal soaking, the experiment best able to exploit beamline capacity, a primary limitation is the need for gentle and nontrivial soaking regimens such as stepwise concentration increases, even for robust and well characterized crystals. Here, the use of acoustic droplet ejection for the soaking of protein crystals with small molecules is described, and it is shown that it is both gentle on crystals and allows very high throughput, with 1000 unique soaks easily performed in under 10 min. In addition to having very low compound consumption (tens of nanolitres per sample), the positional precision of acoustic droplet ejection enables the targeted placement of the compound/solvent away from crystals and towards drop edges, allowing gradual diffusion of solvent across the drop. This ensures both an improvement in the reproducibility of X-ray diffraction and increased solvent tolerance of the crystals, thus enabling higher effective compound-soaking concentrations. The technique is detailed here with examples from the protein target JMJD2D, a histone lysine demethylase with roles in cancer and the focus of active structure-based drug-design efforts.",0
520,Early intervention to improve hand function in hemiplegic cerebral palsy,"Children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy often have marked hand involvement with excessive thumb adduction and flexion and limited active wrist extension from infancy. Post-lesional aberrant plasticity can lead to progressive abnormalities of the developing motor system. Disturbances of somatosensory and visual function and developmental disregard contribute to difficulties with hand use. Progressive soft tissue and bony changes may occur, leading to contractures, which further limit function in a vicious cycle. Early intervention might help to break this cycle, however, the precise nature and appropriateness of the intervention must be carefully considered. Traditional approaches to the hemiplegic upper limb include medications and botulinum toxin injections to manage abnormalities of tone, and surgical interventions. Therapist input, including provision of orthoses, remains a mainstay although many therapies have not been well evaluated. There has been a recent increase in interventions for the hemiplegic upper limb, mostly aimed outside the period of infancy. These include trials of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and bimanual therapy as well as the use of virtual reality and robot-assisted therapy. In future, non-invasive brain stimulation may be combined with therapy. Interventions under investigation in the infant age group include modified CIMT and action observation therapy. A further approach which may be suited to the infant with thumb-in-palm deformity, but which requires evaluation, is the use of elastic taping. Enhanced cutaneous feedback through mechanical stimulation to the skin provided by the tape during movement has been postulated to modulate ongoing muscle activity. If effective, this would represent a low-cost, safe, widely applicable early intervention.",6
521,The antimalarial screening landscape-looking beyond the asexual blood stage,"In recent years, the research agenda to tackle global morbidity and mortality from malaria disease has shifted towards innovation, in the hope that efforts at the frontiers of scientific research may re-invigorate gains made towards eradication. Discovery of new antimalarial drugs with novel chemotypes or modes of action lie at the heart of these efforts. There is a particular interest in drug candidates that target stages of the malaria parasite lifecycle beyond the symptomatic asexual blood stages. This is especially important given the spectre of emerging drug resistance to all current frontline antimalarials. One approach gaining increased interest is the potential of designing novel drugs that target parasite passage from infected individual to feeding mosquito and back again. Action of such therapeutics is geared much more at the population level rather than just concerned with the infected individual. The search for novel drugs active against these stages has been helped by improvements to in vitro culture of transmission and pre-erythrocytic parasite lifecycle stages, robotic automation and high content imaging, methodologies that permit the high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries for drug discovery. Here, we review recent advances in the antimalarial screening landscape, focussed on transmission blocking as a key aim for drug-treatment campaigns of the future.",0
522,"Effectiveness of Automated Locomotor Training in Patients with Acute Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury: A Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Trial","The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the effect of longer training times (50 instead of 25 min per day) using a robotic device results in a better outcome of walking ability of subjects with a subacute motor complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS]-B) and incomplete (AIS-C) spinal cord injury. Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the study, whereof 18 completed, on average, 34 trainings in 8 weeks. Longer training times resulted in better locomotor function. The second important result of the study is that a beneficial effect can be achieved by the application of a robotic device for prolonged training sessions without requiring more personal resources. It has to remain open whether even longer training times (more than 50 min) would result in a still better outcome. In any case, the extent of possible recovery in an individual patient is determined by the level and severity of spinal cord damage.",6
523,On the future of transportation in an era of automated and autonomous vehicles,"Automated vehicles (AVs) already navigate US highways and those of many other nations around the world. Current questions about AVs do not now revolve around whether such technologies should or should not be implemented; they are already with us. Rather, such questions are more and more focused on how such technologies will impact evolving transportation systems, our social world, and the individuals who live within it and whether such systems ought to be fully automated or remain under some form of direct human control. More importantly, how will mobility itself change as these independent operational vehicles first share and then dominate our roadways? How will the public be kept apprised of their evolving capacities, and what will be the impact of science and the communication of scientific advances across the varying forms of social media on these developments? We look here to address these issues and to provide some suggestions for the problems that are currently emerging.",4
524,Quantitative assessment of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pancreatic surgery: an Italian multicenter analysis of 1423 cases from 10 tertiary referral centers,"Few evidences are present on the consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on pancreatic surgery. Aim of this study is to evaluate how COVID-19 influenced the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of surgical pancreatic diseases. A comparative analysis of surgical volumes and clinical, surgical and perioperative outcomes in ten Italian referral centers was conducted between the first semester 2020 and 2019. One thousand four hundred and twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the analysis: 638 from 2020 and 785 from 2019. Surgical volume in 2020 decreased by 18.7% (p < 0.0001). Benign/precursors diseases (- 43.4%; p < 0.0001) and neuroendocrine tumors (- 33.6%; p = 0.008) were the less treated diseases. No difference was reported in terms of discussed cases at the multidisciplinary tumor board (p = 0.43), mean time between diagnosis and neoadjuvant treatment (p = 0.91), indication to surgery and surgical resection (p = 0.35). Laparoscopic and robot-assisted procedures dropped by 45.4% and 61.9%, respectively, during the lockdown weeks of 2020. No difference was documented for post-operative intensive care unit accesses (p = 0.23) and post-operative mortality (p = 0.06). The surgical volume decrease in 2020 will potentially lead, in the near future, to the diagnosis of a higher rate of advanced stage diseases. However, the reassessment of the Italian Health Service kept guarantying an adequate level of care in tertiary referral centers. Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04380766.",3
525,Lung Cancer Surgery in the Early Phase After Acute COVID-19 Pneumonitis,"A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer in 2020 and scheduled for robotic assisted-left upper lobectomy. Unfortunately, the patient contracted symptomatic COVID-19, resulting in postponement of lung resection. She was admitted for surgery 6 weeks after the acute infection. A preoperative computed tomographic scan showed widespread interstitial pneumonitis. However, the operation went ahead given concerns over tumor progression, albeit with a lesser resection to preserve lung tissue because the patient was slightly hypoxic. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged 5 days later. Final histology confirmed a fully resected stage T1c N0 M0 adenocarcinoma of the lung.",0
526,Learning Curves in Pediatric Minimally Invasive Surgery: A Systematic Review of the Literature and a Framework for Reporting,"Aims:
        
      
      There exists a learning curve (LC) with the adoption of any minimally invasive surgical (MIS) technique with implications for training, implementation, and evaluation. A standardized approach to describing and analyzing LCs in pediatric MIS is lacking. We sought to determine how pediatric MIS LCs are quantified and present a framework for reporting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE 1985-October 2015 for articles describing MIS in the pediatric population and presenting formal analysis of the LC. Articles screened by two independent reviewers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-nine articles (n = 17 general abdominal/thoracic, n = 12 urological) from an 18-year period (1997-2015) were included representing 3345 procedures (n = 3116 laparoscopic, n = 10 thoracoscopic, n = 219 robotic). Seven (24%) were prospective, three multicenter. Twenty-two (76%) presented data pertaining to >1 operating surgeon. Operative time was the most commonly employed surrogate of proficiency (n = 26 [90%] studies). Twenty (69%) described >1 LC outcome measure. Sixteen additional measures were described, including conversion (n = 12 studies); blood loss (n = 4 studies); complications (n = 10 studies); and postoperative outcomes (n = 14 studies). Three studies assessed impact of LC on trainees and one considered economic impact. LCs were presented in tabular form (n = 14 studies) and graphically (n = 19). Eleven (38%) studies undertook statistical appraisal utilizing comparative statistics (n = 8 studies) and regression analysis (n = 4 studies).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Multiple outcome measures of proficiency are employed in reporting pediatric MIS experience and analysis of LCs is inconsistent. A standardized multioutcome approach to reporting should be encouraged. In addition, attempts should be made to quantify the impact on trainee involvement. We present an idealized framework for reporting.",1
527,Economic evaluation of different routes of surgery for the management of endometrial cancer: a retrospective cohort study,"Objectives:
        
      
      The benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for endometrial carcinoma (EC) are well established although the financial impact of robotic-assisted hysterectomy (RH) compared with laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) is disputed.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Retrospective cohort study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      English National Health Service hospitals 2011-2017/2018.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      35 304 women having a hysterectomy for EC identified from Hospital Episode Statistics.
    


          Primary and secondary outcome measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was the association between route of surgery on cost at intervention, 30, 90 and 365 days for women undergoing an open hysterectomy (OH) or MIS (LH/RH) for EC in England. The average marginal effect was calculated to compare RH versus OH and RH versus LH which adjusted for any differences in the characteristics of the surgical approaches. Secondary outcomes were to analyse costing data for each surgical approach by age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and hospital MIS rate classification.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 35 304 procedures were performed, 20 405 (57.8%) were MIS (LH: 18 604 and RH: 1801), 14 291 (40.5%) OH. Mean cost for LH was significantly less than RH, whereas RH was significantly less than OH at intervention, 30, 90 and 365 days (p<0.001). Over time, patients who underwent RH had increasing CCI scores and by the 2015/2016 year had a higher average CCI than LH. Comparing the cost of LH and RH against CCI score identified that the costs closely reflected the patients' CCI. Increasing disparity was also seen between the MIS and OH costs with rising age. When exploring the association between provider volume, MIS rate and surgical costs, there was an association with the higher the MIS rate the lower the average cost.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Further research is needed to investigate costs in matched patient cohorts to determine the optimum surgical modality in different populations.",3
528,The Importance of Trust in the Adoption and Use of Intelligent Assistive Technology by Older Adults to Support Aging in Place: Scoping Review Protocol,"Background:
        
      
      Intelligent assistive technologies that complement and extend human abilities have proliferated in recent years. Service robots, home automation equipment, and other digital assistant devices possessing artificial intelligence are forms of assistive technologies that have become popular in society. Older adults (>55 years of age) have been identified by industry, government, and researchers as a demographic who can benefit significantly from the use of intelligent assistive technology to support various activities of daily living.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the literature on the importance of the concept of ""trust"" in the adoption of intelligent assistive technologies to assist aging in place by older adults.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using a scoping review methodology, our search strategy will examine the following databases: ACM Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently screen the initial titles obtained from the search, and these results will be further inspected by other members of the research team for inclusion in the review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      This review will provide insights into how the concept of trust is actualized in the adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults. Preliminary sensitization to the literature suggests that the concept of trust is fluid, unstable, and intimately tied to the type of intelligent assistive technology being examined. Furthermore, a wide range of theoretical lenses that include elements of trust have been used to examine this concept.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review will describe the concept of trust in the adoption of intelligent assistive technology by older adults, and will provide insights for practitioners, policy makers, and technology vendors for future practice.",1
529,Minimally invasive surgery for inflammatory bowel disease: Current perspectives,"The surgical management of complicated and recurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has remained a challenge. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), in the form of laparoscopic resections, single port approach and robotic-assisted dissections in the management of IBD, have been examined in several prospective studies. All of them have shown advantages over open surgery in terms of reduction of physical trauma of surgery, recovery time, better cosmetic outcomes and shorter hospitalization. However, it is important to appreciate that not all patients with IBD are suitable for MIS, so a combination of both open and MIS should be adopted to achieve optimum outcomes. A review on this subject performed by Neumann et al in this issue of World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics have provided evidence in support of the contemporary practice of MIS in the management of IBD and the accompanying commentary further critically evaluates their application in clinical practice.",3
530,Identifying avoidable switchboard delays in England's NHS hospitals: phase one of the national SWITCH project,"Background:
        
      
      Inter-hospital communication frequently requires mediation via a switchboard. Identifying and eliminating switchboard inefficiencies may improve patient care.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All 175 acute hospital switchboards in England were contacted six times. Call contents and duration were recorded. No clinician calls or bleeps were connected.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean delay before contacting a switchboard operative was 55±46 seconds. 115 hospitals (66%) used automated switchboards; 34 of these (30%) had infection control messages. Robot operators introduced an additional 40 second delay versus humans (mean 70.3±28 versus 29.8±23 seconds, p<0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified robot operators (HR 5.1, p<0.0001) and infection control messages (HR 2.9, p=0.003) as predictors of delays over 60 seconds.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There are significant avoidable delays in contacting switchboard operatives across England. Quality improvement is underway.",3

532,Management of spondylolisthesis using MIS techniques: Recent advances,"The authors discuss the recent advances in the understanding and management of spondylolisthesis. The two most common kinds of spondylolisthesis - Degenerative and Spondylolytic types have been elaborated in this paper, with the understanding that similar management principles can be applied to the other lesser common varieties. The impetus has been on application of minimally invasive techniques in the treatment as well as renewed interest in stand-alone decompression in degenerative spondylolisthesis.",0
533,Application of machine learning techniques to tuberculosis drug resistance analysis,"Motivation:
        
      
      Timely identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) resistance to existing drugs is vital to decrease mortality and prevent the amplification of existing antibiotic resistance. Machine learning methods have been widely applied for timely predicting resistance of MTB given a specific drug and identifying resistance markers. However, they have been not validated on a large cohort of MTB samples from multi-centers across the world in terms of resistance prediction and resistance marker identification. Several machine learning classifiers and linear dimension reduction techniques were developed and compared for a cohort of 13 402 isolates collected from 16 countries across 6 continents and tested 11 drugs.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared to conventional molecular diagnostic test, area under curve of the best machine learning classifier increased for all drugs especially by 23.11%, 15.22% and 10.14% for pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively (P < 0.01). Logistic regression and gradient tree boosting found to perform better than other techniques. Moreover, logistic regression/gradient tree boosting with a sparse principal component analysis/non-negative matrix factorization step compared with the classifier alone enhanced the best performance in terms of F1-score by 12.54%, 4.61%, 7.45% and 9.58% for amikacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and capreomycin, respectively, as well increasing area under curve for amikacin and capreomycin. Results provided a comprehensive comparison of various techniques and confirmed the application of machine learning for better prediction of the large diverse tuberculosis data. Furthermore, mutation ranking showed the possibility of finding new resistance/susceptible markers.

534,Digital plant pathology: a foundation and guide to modern agriculture,"Over the last 20 years, researchers in the field of digital plant pathology have chased the goal to implement sensors, machine learning and new technologies into knowledge-based methods for plant phenotyping and plant protection. However, the application of swiftly developing technologies has posed many challenges. Greenhouse and field applications are complex and differ in their study design requirements. Selecting a sensor type (e.g., thermography or hyperspectral imaging), sensor platform (e.g., rovers, unmanned aerial vehicles, or satellites), and the problem-specific spatial and temporal scale adds to the challenge as all pathosystems are unique and differ in their interactions and symptoms, or lack thereof. Adding host-pathogen-environment interactions across time and space increases the complexity even further. Large data sets are necessary to enable a deeper understanding of these interactions. Therefore, modern machine learning methods are developed to realize the fast data analysis of such complex data sets. This reduces not only human effort but also enables an objective data perusal. Especially deep learning approaches show a high potential to identify probable cohesive parameters during plant-pathogen-environment interactions. Unfortunately, the performance and reliability of developed methods are often doubted by the potential user. Gaining their trust is thus needed for real field applications. Linking biological causes to machine learning features and a clear communication, even for non-experts of such results, is a crucial task that will bridge the gap between theory and praxis of a newly developed application. Therefore, we suggest a global connection of experts and data as the basis for defining a common and goal-oriented research roadmap. Such high interconnectivity will likely increase the chances of swift, successful progress in research and practice. A coordination within international excellence clusters will be useful to reduce redundancy of research while supporting the creation and progress of complementary research. With this review, we would like to discuss past research, achievements, as well as recurring and new challenges. Having such a retrospect available, we will attempt to reveal future challenges and provide a possible direction elevating the next decade of research in digital plant pathology.",0
535,Benchmarking of robotic and laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy by using two different methods,"Background:
        
      
      Benchmarking is an important tool for quality comparison and improvement. However, no benchmark values are available for minimally invasive spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, either laparoscopically or robotically assisted. The aim of this study was to establish benchmarks for these techniques using two different methods.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from patients undergoing laparoscopically or robotically assisted spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy were extracted from a multicentre database (2006-2019). Benchmarks for 10 outcomes were calculated using the Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC) and best-patient-in-best-centre methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 951 laparoscopically assisted (77.3 per cent) and 279 robotically assisted (22.7 per cent) procedures were included. Using the ABC method, the benchmarks for laparoscopically assisted and robotically assisted spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy respectively were: 150 and 207 min for duration of operation, 55 and 100 ml for blood loss, 3.5 and 1.7 per cent for conversion, 0 and 1.7 per cent for failure to preserve the spleen, 27.3 and 34.0 per cent for overall morbidity, 5.1 and 3.3 per cent for major morbidity, 3.6 and 7.1 per cent for pancreatic fistula grade B/C, 5 and 6 days for duration of hospital stay, 2.9 and 5.4 per cent for readmissions, and 0 and 0 per cent for 90-day mortality. Best-patient-in-best-centre methodology revealed milder benchmark cut-offs for laparoscopically and robotically assisted procedures, with operating times of 254 and 262.5 min, blood loss of 150 and 195 ml, conversion rates of 5.8 and 8.2 per cent, rates of failure to salvage spleen of 29.9 and 27.3 per cent, overall morbidity rates of 62.7 and 55.7 per cent, major morbidity rates of 20.4 and 14 per cent, POPF B/C rates of 23.8 and 24.2 per cent, duration of hospital stay of 8 and 8 days, readmission rates of 20 and 15.1 per cent, and 90-day mortality rates of 0 and 0 per cent respectively.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Two benchmark methods for minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy produced different values, and should be interpreted and applied differently.",9
536,UAV-UGV-UMV Multi-Swarms for Cooperative Surveillance,"In this paper we present a surveillance system for early detection of escapers from a restricted area based on a new swarming mobility model called CROMM-MS (Chaotic Rössler Mobility Model for Multi-Swarms). CROMM-MS is designed for controlling the trajectories of heterogeneous multi-swarms of aerial, ground and marine unmanned vehicles with important features such as prioritising early detections and success rate. A new Competitive Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (CompCGA) is proposed to optimise the vehicles' parameters and escapers' evasion ability using a predator-prey approach. Our results show that CROMM-MS is not only viable for surveillance tasks but also that its results are competitive in regard to the state-of-the-art approaches.",4
537,Symptom relief and anejaculation after aquablation or transurethral resection of the prostate: subgroup analysis from a blinded randomized trial,"Objective:
        
      
      To test the hypothesis that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) robotic surgery with aquablation would have a more pronounced benefit in certain patient subgroups, such as men with more challenging anatomies (e.g. large prostates, large middle lobes) and men with moderate BPH.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted prespecified and post hoc exploratory subgroup analyses from a double-blind, multicentre prospective randomized controlled trial that compared transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) using either standard electrocautery vs surgery using robotic waterjet (aquablation) to determine whether certain baseline factors predicted more marked responses after aquablation as compared with TURP. The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 6 months. The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of Clavien-Dindo persistent grade 1 or grade ≥2 surgical complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For men with larger prostates (50-80 g), the mean IPSS reduction was four points greater after aquablation than after TURP (P = 0.001), a larger difference than the overall result (1.8 points; P = 0.135). Similarly, the primary safety endpoint difference (20% vs 46% [26% difference]; P = 0.008) was greater for men with large prostate compared with the overall result (26% vs 42% [16% difference]; P = 0.015). Postoperative anejaculation was also less common after aquablation compared with TURP in sexually active men with large prostates (2% vs 41%; P < 0.001) vs the overall results (10% vs 36%; P < 0.001). Exploratory analysis showed larger IPSS changes after aquablation in men with enlarged middle lobes, men with severe middle lobe obstruction, men with a low baseline maximum urinary flow rate, and men with elevated (>100) post-void residual urine volume.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In men with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms attributable to BPH and larger, more complex prostates, aquablation was associated with both superior symptom score improvements and a superior safety profile, with a significantly lower rate of postoperative anejaculation. The standardized, robotically executed, surgical approach with aquablation may overcome the increased outcome variability in more complex anatomy, resulting in superior symptom score reduction.",5
538,From clinical sample to complete genome: Comparing methods for the extraction of HIV-1 RNA for high-throughput deep sequencing,"The BEEHIVE (Bridging the Evolution and Epidemiology of HIV in Europe) project aims to analyse nearly-complete viral genomes from >3000 HIV-1 infected Europeans using high-throughput deep sequencing techniques to investigate the virus genetic contribution to virulence. Following the development of a computational pipeline, including a new de novo assembler for RNA virus genomes, to generate larger contiguous sequences (contigs) from the abundance of short sequence reads that characterise the data, another area that determines genome sequencing success is the quality and quantity of the input RNA. A pilot experiment with 125 patient plasma samples was performed to investigate the optimal method for isolation of HIV-1 viral RNA for long amplicon genome sequencing. Manual isolation with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) was superior over robotically extracted RNA using either the QIAcube robotic system, the mSample Preparation Systems RNA kit with automated extraction by the m2000sp system (Abbott Molecular), or the MagNA Pure 96 System in combination with the MagNA Pure 96 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics). We scored amplification of a set of four HIV-1 amplicons of ∼1.9, 3.6, 3.0 and 3.5kb, and subsequent recovery of near-complete viral genomes. Subsequently, 616 BEEHIVE patient samples were analysed to determine factors that influence successful amplification of the genome in four overlapping amplicons using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit for viral RNA isolation. Both low plasma viral load and high sample age (stored before 1999) negatively influenced the amplification of viral amplicons >3kb. A plasma viral load of >100,000 copies/ml resulted in successful amplification of all four amplicons for 86% of the samples, this value dropped to only 46% for samples with viral loads of <20,000 copies/ml.",1
539,Adaptation and Transfer of Robot Motion Policies for Close Proximity Human-Robot Interaction,"In the context of human-robot collaboration in close proximity, safety and comfort are the two important aspects to achieve joint tasks efficiently. For safety, the robot must be able to avoid dynamic obstacles such as a human arm with high reliability. For comfort, the trajectories and avoidance behavior of the robot need to be predictable to the humans. Moreover, these two aspects might be different from person to person or from one task to another. This work presents a framework to generate predictable motions with dynamic obstacle avoidance for the robot interacting with the human by using policy improvement method. The trajectories are generated using Dynamic Motion Primitives with an additional potential field term that penalizes trajectories that may lead to collisions with obstacles. Furthermore, human movements are predicted using a data-driven approach for proactive avoidance. A cost function is defined which measures different aspects that affect the comfort and predictability of human co-workers (e.g., human response time, joint jerk). This cost function is then minimized during human-robot interaction by the means of policy improvement through black-box optimization to generate robot trajectories that adapt to human preferences and avoid obstacles. User studies are performed to evaluate the trust and comfort of human co-workers when working with the robot. In addition, the studies are also extended to various scenarios and different users to analyze the task transferability. This improves the learning performance when switching to a new task or the robot has to adapt to a different co-worker.",4

      To improve seated postural control in a participant with spinal cord injury (SCI) with a robotic Trunk-Support-Trainer (TruST).
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Laboratory.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      TruST delivered ""assist-as-needed"" forces on the participant's torso during a motor learning-and-control-based intervention (TruST-intervention). TruST-assistive forces were progressed and matched to the participant's postural trunk control gains across six intervention sessions. The T-shirt test was used to capture functional improvements while dressing the upper body. Kinematics were used to compute upper body excursions (cm) and velocity (cm2), and sitting workspace area (cm2). Functional trunk dynamometry was used to examine muscle force (Kg). Surface electromyography (sEMG) was applied to measure trunk muscle activity. The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was used to monitor physical exertion during TruST-intervention. A two-standard-deviation bandwidth method was adopted for data interpretation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      After TruST-intervention, the participant halved the time needed to don and doff a T-shirt, increased muscle force of trunk muscles (mean = 3 kg), acquired a steadier postural sitting control without vision (mean excursion baseline: 76.0 ± 2 SD = 5.25 cm and post-intervention: 44.1 cm; and mean velocity baseline: 3.0 ± 2 SD = 0.2 cm/s and post-intervention: 1.8 cm/s), and expanded his sitting workspace area (mean baseline: 36.7 ± 2 SD = 36.6 cm2 and post-intervention: 419.2 cm2). The participant increased his tolerance to counteract greater TruST-force perturbations in lateral and posterior directions. Furthermore, abdominal muscle activity substantially augmented after completion of TruST-intervention across all perturbation directions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data indicate a potential effectiveness of TruST-intervention to promote functional sitting in SCI.",0
541,Anaesthetic management of robotic-assisted gynaecology surgery in the morbidly obese - A case series of 46 patients in a UK university teaching hospital,"Background and aims:
        
      
      The evolution of robotic technology has enhanced the scope of laparoscopic surgery. Morbid obesity [body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2] due to significant physiological attributes presents a significant surgical and anaesthetic challenge. Robotic surgery in this subset of patients can present with its own problems due to surgical requirements of prolonged pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the anaesthetic management of 46 morbidly obese patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic gynaecology surgery. Patient characteristics, anaesthetic management, length of hospital stay (LOS), complications, and readmissions within 30 days were noted. Mean with standard deviation was used for statistical analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The mean [standard deviation (SD)] weight and BMI were 121.2 (18.49) kg and 47.83 (7.89) kg/m2, respectively. The mean (SD) anaesthetic and surgical times were 229 (75.9) and 167.7 (62.7) min, respectively. The mean (SD) LOS was 1.57 (1.03) days. About 70% of patients were discharged on the first day after surgery. Six patients needed critical care support. There were two readmissions within 30 days.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Good preparation, teamwork, and multidisciplinary input helped us to conduct complex robotic-assisted and long-duration surgery in morbidly obese patients with minimal complications.",3
542,In Search of Trustworthy and Transparent Intelligent Systems With Human-Like Cognitive and Reasoning Capabilities,"At present we are witnessing a tremendous interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Deep Learning (DL)/Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). One of the reasons appears to be the unmatched performance achieved by such systems. This has resulted in an enormous hope on such techniques and often these are viewed as all-cure solutions. But most of these systems cannot explain why a particular decision is made (black box) and sometimes miserably fail in cases where other systems would not. Consequently, in critical applications such as healthcare and defense practitioners do not like to trust such systems. Although an AI system is often designed taking inspiration from the brain, there is not much attempt to exploit cues from the brain in true sense. In our opinion, to realize intelligent systems with human like reasoning ability, we need to exploit knowledge from the brain science. Here we discuss a few findings in brain science that may help designing intelligent systems. We explain the relevance of transparency, explainability, learning from a few examples, and the trustworthiness of an AI system. We also discuss a few ways that may help to achieve these attributes in a learning system.",1
543,Blind testing of cross-linking/mass spectrometry hybrid methods in CASP11,"Hybrid approaches combine computational methods with experimental data. The information contained in the experimental data can be leveraged to probe the structure of proteins otherwise elusive to computational methods. Compared with computational methods, the structures produced by hybrid methods exhibit some degree of experimental validation. In spite of these advantages, most hybrid methods have not yet been validated in blind tests, hampering their development. Here, we describe the first blind test of a specific cross-link based hybrid method in CASP. This blind test was coordinated by the CASP organizers and utilized a novel, high-density cross-linking/mass-spectrometry (CLMS) approach that is able to collect high-density CLMS data in a matter of days. This experimental protocol was developed in the Rappsilber laboratory. This approach exploits the chemistry of a highly reactive, photoactivatable cross-linker to produce an order of magnitude more cross-links than homobifunctional cross-linkers. The Rappsilber laboratory generated experimental CLMS data based on this protocol, submitted the data to the CASP organizers which then released this data to the CASP11 prediction groups in a separate, CLMS assisted modeling experiment. We did not observe a clear improvement of assisted models, presumably because the properties of the CLMS data-uncertainty in cross-link identification and residue-residue assignment, and uneven distribution over the protein-were largely unknown to the prediction groups and their approaches were not yet tailored to this kind of data. We also suggest modifications to the CLMS-CASP experiment and discuss the importance of rigorous blind testing in the development of hybrid methods.

544,Developing control algorithms of a voluntary cough for an artificial bioengineered larynx using surface electromyography of chest muscles: A prospective cohort study,"Objective:
        
      
      This prospective cohort study investigates the prediction of a voluntary cough using surface electromyography (EMG) of intercostal and diaphragm muscles, to develop control algorithms for an EMG-controlled artificial larynx.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The Ear Institute, London.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Electromyography onset compared to voluntary cough exhalation onset and to 100 ms (to give the artificial larynx the time to close the bioengineered vocal cords) before voluntary cough exhalation onset, in twelve healthy participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the 189 EMG of intercostal muscle-detected voluntary coughs, 172 coughs (91% CI 70-112) were detected before onset of cough exhalation and 128 coughs (67.6% CI 33.7-101.7) 100 ms before onset of cough exhalation. In the 158 EMG of diaphragm muscle-detected voluntary coughs, 149 coughs (94.3% CI 76.3-112.3) were detected before onset of cough exhalation and 102 coughs (64.6% CI 26.6-102.6) 100 ms before onset of cough exhalation. More coughs were detected before onset of cough exhalation when combining EMG activity of intercostal and diaphragm muscles and comparing this to intercostal muscle activity alone (183 coughs [96.8% CI 83.8-109.8] vs 172 coughs, P = .0294). When comparing the mentioned combination to diaphragm muscle activity alone, the higher percentage of detected coughs before cough exhalation onset was not found to be significant (183 coughs vs 149 coughs, P = .295). In addition, more coughs were detected 100 ms before onset of cough exhalation with the mentioned combination of EMG activity and comparing this to intercostal muscles alone (149 coughs [78.8% CI 48.8-108.8] vs 128 coughs, P = .0198) and to diaphragm muscles alone (149 coughs vs 102 coughs, P = .0038).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most voluntary coughs can be predicted based on combined EMG signals of intercostal and diaphragm muscles, and therefore, these two muscle groups will be useful in controlling the bioengineered vocal cords within the artificial larynx during a voluntary cough.",2
545,"The role of the speech and language therapist in the rehabilitation of speech, swallowing, voice and trismus in people diagnosed with head and neck cancer","Head and neck cancer (HNC) and its treatment can have a significant impact on physical and psychosocial wellbeing. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is critical to reduce the potential acute, long-term and late effects of treatment by optimising function at baseline, supporting people during treatment and with rehabilitation post treatment. The key focus for speech and language therapists is to support the holistic needs of people with a focus on speech, swallowing, voice and mouth opening. Effective management is reliant on working with MDT members and interventions are implemented against the background of robust multidimensional baseline evaluation. There have been significant advances in treatment modalities for both primary and recurrent HNC. These include highly conformal radiotherapy modalities, including: image-guided radiotherapy; parotid-sparing and dysphagia-optimised intensity-modulated radiotherapy; and the introduction of intensity-modulated proton therapy, as well as immunotherapy, transoral robotic surgery and surgery with advanced reconstructive techniques. Such treatment advances coupled with a changing patient demographic means that people with HNC are now living longer. However, this is not always without consequences and late treatment effects are a new challenge facing MDTs, requiring high levels of support and rehabilitation.",1
546,Thou shalt not trust online videos for inguinal hernia repair techniques,"Background:
        
      
      Videos are used by surgeons when learning new techniques; however, online videos are often not vetted. Our aim is to review online videos of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs based on a benchmark for critical view of the myopectineal orifice (MPO) and safe inguinal hernia repair as defined by Daes and Felix and commonly referred to as ""the 9 Commandments.""
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      YouTubeⓇ was queried for ""laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair."" The top 50 videos were ranked based on number of views. Those endorsed and/or vetted by surgical societies were excluded (n = 4). Three expert hernia surgeons scored the videos based on adherence to the 9 Commandments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The 50 videos originated from 11 countries. They had 72,825 mean views and a mean runtime of 14 min. Videos obeyed a median of 77.8% of commandments shown. Eight videos (16%) obeyed all 9 (100%) commandments. Three videos (6%) failed to obey any commandments. Operations employed TEP (18, 36%), TAPP (28, 56%), and rTAPP (4, 8%) approach. Stratification by approach showed significant variance in commandments obeyed (Kurskal-Wallis, p = 0.016) with significant difference between TEP and rTAPP scores (p = 0.008) and no significant difference between TEP and TAPP or rTAPP and TAPP scores. Twenty-three videos (46%) displayed unsafe techniques including: threatened critical structures (16, 32%), rough tissue handling (15, 30%), and dangerous placement of fixation (9, 18%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Online surgical videos on YouTube are not reliable in demonstrating best practices for minimally invasive inguinal hernia repairs. In our study, only 16% of the most viewed videos followed all 9 Commandments for critical view of the MPO. Many showed suboptimal repairs with significant safety concerns. While a significant number of online videos are a free and readily available resource for surgeons around the world, we recommend caution in relying on non-vetted videos as a form of surgical education.",3
547,Laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Hepatic Surgery: An Historical Review,"Hepatic surgery is a rapidly expanding component of abdominal surgery and is performed for a wide range of indications. The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1987 was a major change in abdominal surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was widely and rapidly adopted throughout the world for cholecystectomy initially and then applied to a variety of other procedures. Laparoscopic surgery became regularly applied to hepatic surgery, including segmental and major resections as well as organ donation. Many operations progressed from open surgery to laparoscopy to robot-assisted surgery, including colon resection, pancreatectomy, splenectomy thyroidectomy, adrenalectomy, prostatectomy, gastrectomy, and others. It is difficult to prove a data-based benefit using robot-assisted surgery, although laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery of the liver are not inferior regarding major outcomes. When laparoscopic surgery initially became popular, many had concerns about its use to treat malignancies. Robot-assisted surgery is being used to treat a variety of benign and malignant conditions, and studies have shown no deterioration in outcomes. Robot-assisted surgery for the treatment of malignancies has become accepted and is now being used at more centers. The outcomes after robot-assisted surgery depend on its use at specialized centers, the surgeon's personal experience backed up by extensive training and maintenance of international registries. Robot-assisted hepatic surgery has been shown to be associated with slightly less intraoperative blood loss and shorter hospital lengths of stay compared to open surgery. Oncologic outcomes have been maintained, and some studies show higher rates of R0 resections. Patients who need surgery for liver lesions should identify a surgeon they trust and should not be concerned with the specific operative approach used. The growth of robot-assisted surgery of the liver has occurred in a stepwise approach which is very different from the frenzy that was seen with the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This approach allowed the identification of areas for improvement, many of which are at the nexus of engineering and medicine. Further improvements in robot-assisted surgery depend on the combined efforts of engineers and surgeons.",3
548,Salvage Versus Primary Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity-matched Comparative Effectiveness Study from a High-volume Tertiary Centre,"Background:
        
      
      Salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (sRARP) is a potential treatment option for locally recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) after nonsurgical primary treatment. There are minimal data comparing outcomes between propensity-matched sRARP and primary robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The primary objective is to compare perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes of sRARP with primary RARP, and the secondary is to compare outcomes between sRARP after whole and focal gland therapy.
    


          Design setting and participants:
        
      
      A 1:1 propensity-matched comparison was carried out of 135 sRARP cases with primary RARP cases from a cohort of 3852 consecutive patients from a high-volume tertiary centre.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes including complication rates, positive surgical margins, biochemical recurrence (BCR), continence, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were retrospectively collected.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between sRARP and primary RARP groups. In the salvage and primary groups, median (interquartile range) follow-up periods were 521 (304-951) and 638 (394-951) d, grade III-V Clavien-Dindo complication rates were 1.5% and 0% (p = 0.310), BCR rates were 31.9% and 14.1% (p < 0.001) at the last follow-up, pad-free continence rates were 78.8% and 84.3% at 2 yr (p = 0.337), and ED rates were 94.8% and 76.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. Comparing the whole and focal gland groups, BCR rates were 36.7% and 29.1% (p = 0.687) at follow-up, pad-free continence rates were 53.1% and 89.3% at 2 yr (p < 0.001), and ED rates were 98% and 93% (p = 0.214), respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Salvage RARP has similar perioperative outcomes to primary RARP with inferior potency rates. Post-focal therapy sRARP has similar recurrence and continence rates to primary RARP. Post-whole gland therapy, complication, and recurrence rates are higher, and there is a higher risk of urinary incontinence.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We report the largest propensity-matched comparison of salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) after focal and whole gland therapy. Salvage RARP is a feasible procedure for the treatment of locally recurrent prostate cancer in high-volume centres; however, patients should be counselled appropriately as to the different outcomes.",2
549,"Surgical innovation revisited: A historical narrative of the minimally invasive ""Agarwal sliding-clip renorrhaphy"" technique for partial nephrectomy and its application to an Australian cohort","Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate local clinical outcomes of sliding clip renorrhaphy, from inception to current utilization for open, laparoscopic, and robotically assisted partial nephrectomy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We reviewed prospectively maintained databases of three surgeons performing partial nephrectomies with the sliding-clip technique at teaching hospitals between 2005 and 2019. Baseline characteristics, operative parameters, including surgical approach, RENAL Nephrometry Score, and post-operative outcomes, including Clavien-Dindo classification of complications, were recorded for 76 consecutive cases. We compared perioperative and 90-day events with patient and tumor characteristics, stratified by operative approach and case complexity, using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and the Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, for binary and categorical variables, respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Open surgery (n = 15) reduced ischemia time and operative time, but increased hospital admission time. Pre- and post-operative estimated glomerular filtration rates did not change significantly by operative approach. Older patients (P = .007) and open surgery (P = .003) were associated with a higher rate of complications (any-grade). Six grade ≥3 complications occurred: these were associated with higher RENAL Nephrometry Score (P = .016) and higher pathological tumor stage (P = .045). Limits include smaller case volumes which incorporate the learning curve cases; therefore, these data are most applicable to lower volume teaching hospitals.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The sliding-clip technique for partial nephrectomy was first described by Agarwal et al and has low complication rates, acceptable operative time, and preserves renal function across open and minimally invasive surgeries. This series encompasses the initial learning curve with developing the technique through to present-day emergence as a routine standard of practice.",9

551,Minimally invasive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for men with testis cancer: a retrospective cohort study of safety and feasibility,"Purpose:
        
      
      To describe the perioperative safety, functional and immediate post-operative oncological outcomes of minimally invasive RPLND (miRPLND) for testis cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a retrospective multi-centre cohort study on testis cancer patients treated with miRPLND from 16 institutions in eight countries. We measured clinician-reported outcomes stratified by indication. We performed logistic regression to identify predictors for maintained postoperative ejaculatory function.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data for 457 men undergoing miRPLND were studied. miRPLND comprised laparoscopic (n = 56) or robotic (n = 401) miRPLND. Indications included pre-chemotherapy in 305 and post-chemotherapy in 152 men. The median retroperitoneal mass size was 32 mm and operative time 270 min. Intraoperative complications occurred in 20 (4%) and postoperative complications in 26 (6%). In multivariable regression, nerve sparing, and template resection improved ejaculatory function significantly (template vs bilateral resection [odds ratio (OR) 19.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5-75.6], nerve sparing vs non-nerve sparing [OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.3-16.1]). In 91 men treated with primary RPLND, nerve sparing and template resection, normal postoperative ejaculation was reported in 96%. During a median follow-up of 33 months, relapse was detected in 39 (9%) of which one with port site (< 1%), one with peritoneal recurrence and 10 (2%) with retroperitoneum recurrences.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The low proportion of complications or peritoneal recurrences and high proportion of men with normal postoperative ejaculatory function supports further miRPLND studies.",2
552,The impact of socio-economic deprivation on recovery following robotic assisted radical cystectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Despite enhanced recovery programmes, length of stay is variable following robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). The aim of this study was to assess the impact socioeconomic deprivation on recovery following RARC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The prospectively maintained RARC databases at two tertiary referral hospitals were reviewed from 2015 to 2017. Demographic, histological, and outcome data including length of stay (LOS), operation time and blood loss were recorded. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, was chosen as a deprivation index as this is used by the UK government to direct funding and resources to regions, towns and postal codes by assessing a number of indicators.
    


          Results:
        
      
      During the study period, 340 consecutive patients underwent RARC. Deprivation deciles were significantly higher in site 1 patients (7.9 in site 1 vs 6.6 in site 2, p < 0.001) implying that these patients are more likely to have higher incomes, levels of education and improved living environments. The mean operating time was longer in the site 1 cohort (397 vs 366 min, p > 0.001) with a reduced mean blood loss volume (252 and 484 mL, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in mean LOS (6.2 days in site 1 vs 10.6 days in site 2, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, a higher deprivation decile did not predict LOS (OR = 1, 95% CI = 0.9-1.1, p = 0.407). Sex and operation site were however significantly associated with LOS (p = 0.006 and <0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Recovery following RARC was independent of socioeconomic status when comparing two hospitals with diverse catchment areas in the UK.",8
553,Should Robotic Surgery Simulation Be Introduced in the Core Surgical Training Curriculum?,"Introduction: The focus of this research is to qualitatively analyse the literature and address the knowledge gap between robotic surgery simulation (RoSS) and core surgical training curriculum. It will compare the effectiveness and the benefits of using robotic simulators in training as compared to the current standard training methods. Materials and Methods: A qualitative research of literature was carried out with the use of critical analysis formatting to expand the search. The inclusion criteria entailed selecting academic resources that focused on Robotic Surgery Simulation (RoSS) and core surgical curriculum. The Online databases used in the search took into account information retrieval from stakeholders. Evidence Synthesis: In this article, we compiled and scrutinized the available relevant literature comparing performance assessments, surgical skills transfer and assessment tools between robotic surgery simulation (RoSS) and current training platforms in open and minimal access surgery. Data that has been published underpins the authenticity of robotic Surgery Simulation (RoSS), based on a combination of observational evaluation and simulation scores. Conclusion: The introduction of robotic surgery simulation (RoSS) has the potential to bring major improvements in the surgical training curriculum. RoSS platforms are more robust in terms of ensuring rapid surgical skills transfer/ acquisition, assessment is standardized, unbiased and the training covers non-technical skills aspects.",3
554,Trends in quality of life reporting for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion over the last four decades: A systematic review of the literature,"Objective: To report the trends in quality of life (QoL) reporting for radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion (UD) over the last four decades, as RC for bladder cancer is associated with significant morbidity and QoL issues. Material and methods: We searched PubMed, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane library for published studies from January 1980 to January 2017 in the English language. We divided the published articles into three time periods: period-1 (1980-1997), period-2 (1998-2007) and period-3 (2008-2017). Results: A total of 85 QoL studies (8417 patients) were identified, of which 3347 (39.8%) patients had an ileal conduit (IC), 1078 (12.8%) had a continent UD (CD), 3264 (38.8%) had a neobladder (NB), and in the remaining 728 (8.6%) the type of UD was not specified. Whilst there were 15, 24 and 41 studies in period-1, period-2 and period-3 respectively, two (13%), 20 (83%) and 37 (90%) used a validated QoL tool; and none, six (25%) and 23 (56%) used a urology specific QoL tool during these three time periods. Similarly, the number of prospective studies increased from one (7%) to four (17%) and 14 (34%) in these three time periods. The proportion of reported IC patients reduced from 65% (784 patients) to 36% (899) and 35% (1664) from period-1 to period-3, whereas the proportion of NB patients increased from 4.5% (54) to 44% (1105) and 44% (2105). Over the last few years there have been QoL studies on laparoscopic and robotic IC and NB UDs. Conclusion: Our review suggests an increasing use of validated, bladder cancer-specific questionnaires with UD-specific constructs.

555,Multi-Label Random Forest Model for Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Classification and Mutation Ranking,"Resistance prediction and mutation ranking are important tasks in the analysis of Tuberculosis sequence data. Due to standard regimens for the use of first-line antibiotics, resistance co-occurrence, in which samples are resistant to multiple drugs, is common. Analysing all drugs simultaneously should therefore enable patterns reflecting resistance co-occurrence to be exploited for resistance prediction. Here, multi-label random forest (MLRF) models are compared with single-label random forest (SLRF) for both predicting phenotypic resistance from whole genome sequences and identifying important mutations for better prediction of four first-line drugs in a dataset of 13402 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Results confirmed that MLRFs can improve performance compared to conventional clinical methods (by 18.10%) and SLRFs (by 0.91%). In addition, we identified a list of candidate mutations that are important for resistance prediction or that are related to resistance co-occurrence. Moreover, we found that retraining our analysis to a subset of top-ranked mutations was sufficient to achieve satisfactory performance.

Despite advanced investigations, the primary tumour location remains unknown in up to 40% of these cases. Transoral robotic surgery presents a viable diagnostic and therapeutic option in these patients. This surgical innovation alongside advances in the understanding of head and neck cancer biology means that a multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex patients is of utmost importance to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes.",1

559,Microfluidic Templating of Spatially Inhomogeneous Protein Microgels,"3D scaffolds in the form of hydrogels and microgels have allowed for more native cell-culture systems to be developed relative to flat substrates. Native biological tissues are, however, usually spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic, but regulating the spatial density of hydrogels at the microscale to mimic this inhomogeneity has been challenging to achieve. Moreover, the development of biocompatible synthesis approaches for protein-based microgels remains challenging, and typical gelation conditions include UV light, extreme pH, extreme temperature, or organic solvents, factors which can compromise the viability of cells. This study addresses these challenges by demonstrating an approach to fabricate protein microgels with controllable radial density through microfluidic mixing and physical and enzymatic crosslinking of gelatin precursor molecules. Microgels with a higher density in their cores and microgels with a higher density in their shells are demonstrated. The microgels have robust stability at 37 °C and different dissolution rates through enzymolysis, which can be further used for gradient scaffolds for 3D cell culture, enabling controlled degradability, and the release of biomolecules. The design principles of the microgels could also be exploited to generate other soft materials for applications ranging from novel protein-only micro reactors to soft robots.",7
560,Neck Dissection Timing in Transoral Robotic or Laser Microsurgery in Oropharyngeal Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Objective:
        
      
      This review assesses the effect on intra- and postoperative patient outcomes of the timing of neck dissection in relation to transoral surgery. Outcome measures include postoperative bleeding, intra- and postoperative fistula formation, and disease-specific and overall survival.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      A search was conducted across the MEDLINE, Embase, US National Library of Medicine, and Cochrane databases with search terms in July 2021.
    


          Review methods:
        
      
      Articles that conformed with specified inclusion criteria were included. Included articles were scanned for bias with the ROBINS-I tool.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nineteen articles were selected for qualitative analysis, including 546 patients who had neck dissection in conjunction with transoral robotic surgery/transoral laser microsurgery (TORS/TLM). Seventy-one (18%) patients had neck dissection prior to TORS/TLM, 39 (10%) had neck dissection performed after TORS/TLM, and 281 (72%) had concurrent procedures. In patients with neck dissection before TORS/TLM, 3% experienced major postoperative bleeding, and fistula rates were 0%. In the cohort with neck dissection after TORS/TLM, 3% experienced minor postoperative hemorrhage, and 8% had intraoperative fistulae. In the concurrent cohort of patients, 1% had major postoperative bleeds and 0.3% had minor bleeds, while 4% developed intraoperative fistulas and 0.3% developed postoperative fistulas.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Current evidence indicated that there appears to be no correlation between timing of neck dissection and complications. This systematic review found insufficient data to comment on whether the timing of neck dissection in relation to TORS/TLM affects the outcomes of patients.",1
561,Accuracy of intracranial electrode placement for stereoencephalography: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      Stereoencephalography (SEEG) is a procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the brain to help define the epileptogenic zone. This is performed prior to definitive epilepsy surgery in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy when noninvasive data are inconclusive. The main risk of the procedure is hemorrhage, which occurs in 1-2% of patients. This may result from inaccurate electrode placement or a planned electrode damaging a blood vessel that was not detected on the preoperative vascular imaging. Proposed techniques include the use of a stereotactic frame, frameless image guidance systems, robotic guidance systems, and customized patient-specific fixtures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a structured search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases identified studies that involve the following: (1) SEEG placement as part of the presurgical workup in patients with (2) drug-resistant focal epilepsy for which (3) accuracy data have been provided.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three hundred twenty-six publications were retrieved, of which 293 were screened following removal of duplicate and non-English-language studies. Following application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the meta-analysis. Accuracies for SEEG electrode implantations have been combined using a random-effects analysis and stratified by technique.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      The published literature regarding accuracy of SEEG implantation techniques is limited. There are no prospective controlled clinical trials comparing different SEEG implantation techniques. Significant systematic heterogeneity exists between the identified studies, preventing any meaningful comparison between techniques. The recent introduction of robotic trajectory guidance systems has been suggested to provide a more accurate method of implantation, but supporting evidence is limited to class 3 only. It is important that new techniques are compared to the previous ""gold-standard"" through well-designed and methodologically sound studies before they are introduced into widespread clinical practice.",0
562,Dataset of high-throughput ligand screening against the RNA Packaging Signals regulating Hepatitis B Virus nucleocapsid formation,"Multiple ssRNA viruses which infect bacteria, plants or humans use RNA Packaging Signal (PS)-mediated regulation during assembly to package their genomes faithfully and efficiently. PSs typically comprise short nucleotide recognition motifs, most often presented in the unpaired region of RNA stem-loops, and often bind their cognate coat proteins (CPs) with nanomolar affinity. PSs identified to date are resilient in the face of the typical error prone replication of their virus-coded polymerases, making them potential drug targets. An immobilised array of small molecular weight, drug-like compounds was panned against a fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotide encompassing the most conserved Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) PS, PS1, known to be a major determinant in nucleocapsid formation. This identified > 70 compounds that bind PS1 uniquely in the array. The commercially available 66 of these were tested for their potential effect(s) on HBV nucleocapsid-like particle (NCP) assembly in vitro, which identified potent assembly inhibitors. Here, we describe a high-throughput screen for such effects using employing fluorescence anisotropy in a 96-well microplate format. HBV genomic RNAs (gRNA) and short oligonucleotides encompassing PS1 were 5' labelled with an Alexa Fluor 488 dye. Excess (with respect to stoichiometric T = 4 NCP formation) HBV core protein (Cp) dimers were titrated robotically into solutions containing each of these RNAs stepwise, using a Biomek 4000 liquid handling robot. The anisotropy values of these mixtures were monitored using a POLARstar microplate reader. NCP-like structures were challenged with RNase A to identify reactions that did not result in complete NCP formation. The results imply that ∼50% of the compounds prevent complete NCP formation, highlighting both PS-meditated assembly and the PS-binding compounds as potential directly-acting anti-virals with a novel molecular target. Importantly, this method allows high-throughput in vitro screening for assembly inhibitors in this major human pathogen.",7
563,Human-Robot Mutual Adaptation in Shared Autonomy,"Shared autonomy integrates user input with robot autonomy in order to control a robot and help the user to complete a task. Our work aims to improve the performance of such a human-robot team: the robot tries to guide the human towards an effective strategy, sometimes against the human's own preference, while still retaining his trust. We achieve this through a principled human-robot mutual adaptation formalism. We integrate a bounded-memory adaptation model of the human into a partially observable stochastic decision model, which enables the robot to adapt to an adaptable human. When the human is adaptable, the robot guides the human towards a good strategy, maybe unknown to the human in advance. When the human is stubborn and not adaptable, the robot complies with the human's preference in order to retain their trust. In the shared autonomy setting, unlike many other common human-robot collaboration settings, only the robot actions can change the physical state of the world, and the human and robot goals are not fully observable. We address these challenges and show in a human subject experiment that the proposed mutual adaptation formalism improves human-robot team performance, while retaining a high level of user trust in the robot, compared to the common approach of having the robot strictly following participants' preference.",4
564,Computationally modeling interpersonal trust,"We present a computational model capable of predicting-above human accuracy-the degree of trust a person has toward their novel partner by observing the trust-related nonverbal cues expressed in their social interaction. We summarize our prior work, in which we identify nonverbal cues that signal untrustworthy behavior and also demonstrate the human mind's readiness to interpret those cues to assess the trustworthiness of a social robot. We demonstrate that domain knowledge gained from our prior work using human-subjects experiments, when incorporated into the feature engineering process, permits a computational model to outperform both human predictions and a baseline model built in naiveté of this domain knowledge. We then present the construction of hidden Markov models to investigate temporal relationships among the trust-related nonverbal cues. By interpreting the resulting learned structure, we observe that models built to emulate different levels of trust exhibit different sequences of nonverbal cues. From this observation, we derived sequence-based temporal features that further improve the accuracy of our computational model. Our multi-step research process presented in this paper combines the strength of experimental manipulation and machine learning to not only design a computational trust model but also to further our understanding of the dynamics of interpersonal trust.",4
565,Diaphragmatic paralysis post COVID-19 treated with robot-assisted plication reinforced with acellular dermal matrix: a report of two cases,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a disease of global importance, with an increasing array of sequelae attributed to infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. One such complication that has been rarely documented thus far is diaphragmatic dysfunction. Here, we report the cases of 2 individuals who developed diaphragmatic paralysis post COVID-19, which failed to respond to conservative management. Both patients proceeded to undergo robot-assisted thoracoscopic plication of the diaphragm reinforced with a bovine acellular dermal matrix. In both cases, there was significant improvement in symptomatology, namely dyspnoea and fatigue. We conclude that robot-assisted diaphragmatic plication should be considered for the treatment of refractory diaphragmatic paralysis post COVID-19.",0
566,PHENOS: a high-throughput and flexible tool for microorganism growth phenotyping on solid media,"Background:
        
      
      Microbial arrays, with a large number of different strains on a single plate printed with robotic precision, underpin an increasing number of genetic and genomic approaches. These include Synthetic Genetic Array analysis, high-throughput Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis and 2-hybrid techniques. Measuring the growth of individual colonies within these arrays is an essential part of many of these techniques but is useful for any work with arrays. Measurement is typically done using intermittent imagery fed into complex image analysis software, which is not especially accurate and is challenging to use effectively. We have developed a simple and fast alternative technique that uses a pinning robot and a commonplace microplate reader to continuously measure the thickness of colonies growing on solid agar, complemented by a technique for normalizing the amount of cells initially printed to each spot of the array in the first place. We have developed software to automate the process of combining multiple sets of readings, subtracting agar absorbance, and visualizing colony thickness changes in a number of informative ways.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The ""PHENOS"" pipeline (PHENotyping On Solid media), optimized for Saccharomyces yeasts, produces highly reproducible growth curves and is particularly sensitive to low-level growth. We have empirically determined a formula to estimate colony cell count from an absorbance measurement, and shown this to be comparable with estimates from measurements in liquid. We have also validated the technique by reproducing the results of an earlier QTL study done with conventional liquid phenotyping, and found PHENOS to be considerably more sensitive.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ""PHENOS"" is a cost effective and reliable high-throughput technique for quantifying growth of yeast arrays, and is likely to be equally very useful for a range of other types of microbial arrays. A detailed guide to the pipeline and software is provided with the installation files at https://github.com/gact/phenos .",0
567,Anaesthesia for Major Urological Surgery,"This article focuses on the anesthetic considerations for major cancer urology surgeries such as cystectomies, nephrectomies, and radical prostatectomies. It aims to explore the anesthetic considerations for both open and minimally invasive techniques.",2
568,From Here to Autonomy,"As autonomous and semiautonomous systems are developed for automotive, aviation, cyber, robotics and other applications, the ability of human operators to effectively oversee and interact with them when needed poses a significant challenge. An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human-autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human-automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches. Recommendations for the design of human-autonomy interfaces are presented and directions for future research discussed.",4
569,Expansion and contraction of resource allocation in sensory bottlenecks,"Topographic sensory representations often do not scale proportionally to the size of their input regions, with some expanded and others contracted. In vision, the foveal representation is magnified cortically, as are the fingertips in touch. What principles drive this allocation, and how should receptor density, for example, the high innervation of the fovea or the fingertips, and stimulus statistics, for example, the higher contact frequencies on the fingertips, contribute? Building on work in efficient coding, we address this problem using linear models that optimally decorrelate the sensory signals. We introduce a sensory bottleneck to impose constraints on resource allocation and derive the optimal neural allocation. We find that bottleneck width is a crucial factor in resource allocation, inducing either expansion or contraction. Both receptor density and stimulus statistics affect allocation and jointly determine convergence for wider bottlenecks. Furthermore, we show a close match between the predicted and empirical cortical allocations in a well-studied model system, the star-nosed mole. Overall, our results suggest that the strength of cortical magnification depends on resource limits.",4
570,Posterior Percutaneous Screw Fixation to Treat Vertebral Fracture Non-union in Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis,"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) alters the biomechanical properties of the spine, rendering it highly prone to fracture, following even minor trauma. Risk of delayed diagnosis of vertebral fractures is particularly high in this cohort of patients since radiographs are notoriously difficult to interpret and presentation is late, due to difficulty distinguishing new from pre-existing back pain. Our case describes a gentleman in his late sixties with a six-month delay in presentation to our services with a T12 fracture, secondary to previously undiagnosed DISH, which had progressed to non-union. He underwent T9-L3 thoracolumbar posterior percutaneous stabilisation and fusion. At eighteen months follow-up, there was evidence of union, significant improvement in his pain, no focal neurology signs, and the patient had returned to his activities of daily living (ADLs).",0
571,"Vision-Based Steering Control, Speed Assistance and Localization for Inner-City Vehicles","Autonomous route following with road vehicles has gained popularity in the last few decades. In order to provide highly automated driver assistance systems, different types and combinations of sensors have been presented in the literature. However, most of these approaches apply quite sophisticated and expensive sensors, and hence, the development of a cost-efficient solution still remains a challenging problem. This work proposes the use of a single monocular camera sensor for an automatic steering control, speed assistance for the driver and localization of the vehicle on a road. Herein, we assume that the vehicle is mainly traveling along a predefined path, such as in public transport. A computer vision approach is presented to detect a line painted on the road, which defines the path to follow. Visual markers with a special design painted on the road provide information to localize the vehicle and to assist in its speed control. Furthermore, a vision-based control system, which keeps the vehicle on the predefined path under inner-city speed constraints, is also presented. Real driving tests with a commercial car on a closed circuit finally prove the applicability of the derived approach. In these tests, the car reached a maximum speed of 48 km/h and successfully traveled a distance of 7 km without the intervention of a human driver and any interruption.",0
572,Endoscopic and keyhole endoscope-assisted neurosurgical approaches: a qualitative survey on technical challenges and technological solutions,"Introduction:
        
      
      The literature reflects a resurgence of interest in endoscopic and keyhole endoscope-assisted neurosurgical approaches as alternatives to conventional microsurgical approaches in carefully selected cases. The aim of this study was to assess the technical challenges of neuroendoscopy, and the scope for technological innovations to overcome these barriers.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      All full members of the Society of British Neurosurgeons (SBNS) were electronically invited to participate in an online survey. The open-ended structured survey asked three questions; firstly, whether the surgeon presently utilises or has experience with endoscopic or endoscope-assisted approaches; secondly, what they consider to be the major technical barriers to adopting such approaches; and thirdly, what technological advances they foresee improving safety and efficacy in the field. Responses were subjected to a qualitative research method of multi-rater emergent theme analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Three clear themes emerged: 1) surgical approach and better integration with image-guidance systems (20%), 2) intra-operative visualisation and improvements in neuroendoscopy (49%), and 3) surgical manipulation and improvements in instruments (74%).
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The analysis of responses to our open-ended survey revealed that although opinion was varied three major themes could be identified. Emerging technological advances such as augmented reality, high-definition stereo-endoscopy, and robotic joint-wristed instruments may help overcome the technical difficulties associated with neuroendoscopic approaches.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Results of this qualitative survey provide consensus amongst the technology end-user community such that unambiguous goals and priorities may be defined. Systems integrating these advances could improve the safety and efficacy of endoscopic and endoscope-assisted neurosurgical approaches.",0
573,The influence of perceived vocal traits on trusting behaviours in an economic game,"When presented with voices, we make rapid, automatic judgements of social traits such as trustworthiness-and such judgements are highly consistent across listeners. However, it remains unclear whether voice-based first impressions actually influence behaviour towards a voice's owner, and-if they do-whether and how they interact over time with the voice owner's observed actions to further influence the listener's behaviour. This study used an investment game paradigm to investigate (1) whether voices judged to differ in relevant social traits accrued different levels of investment and/or (2) whether first impressions of the voices interacted with the behaviour of their apparent owners to influence investments over time. Results show that participants were responding to their partner's behaviour. Crucially, however, there were no effects of voice. These findings suggest that, at least under some conditions, social traits perceived from the voice alone may not influence trusting behaviours in the context of a virtual interaction.",7
574,Cup placement in primary total hip arthroplasty: how to get it right without navigation or robotics,"Acetabular component orientation and position are important factors in the short- and long-term outcomes of total hip arthroplasty. Different definitions of inclination and anteversion are used in the orthopaedic literature and surgeons should be aware of these differences and understand their relationships. There is no universal safe zone. Preoperative planning should be used to determine the optimum position and orientation of the cup and assess spinopelvic characteristics to adjust cup orientation accordingly. A peripheral reaming technique leads to a more accurate restoration of the centre of rotation with less variability compared with a standard reaming technique. Several intraoperative landmarks can be used to control the version of the cup, the most commonly used and studied is the transverse acetabular ligament. The use of an inclinometer reduces the variability associated with the use of freehand or mechanical alignment guides.",3
575,Effect of Operative Time on Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Versus Open Pancreatoduodenectomy,"Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate how operative time interacts with outcomes among different approaches to pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Minimally invasive PDs (MIPD), which include laparoscopic (LPD) and robotic (RPD) approaches, are increasingly performed in the USA. MIPD are generally associated with longer operative times (OT) compared to open PD (OPD). Increased OT is associated with inferior outcomes for OPD; however, the effect of OT on MIPD is not well understood.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)-targeted pancreatectomy dataset was utilized (2014-2019). Propensity score matching, logistic regression, and mixed effect modeling were performed to determine the effect of OT on outcomes following PD. OTs were stratified by quartiles for each approach, and outcomes were subsequently compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 23,988 PDs, 22,185 were OPD and 1803 MIPD. Increased OT was associated with greater overall morbidity in all approaches. When comparing OT quartiles, MIPD was consistently associated with improved overall morbidity compared to OPD in matched cohorts. However, for upper quartiles, prolonged OT in MIPD was associated with significantly increased reoperation rates and mortality. The effect of OT on overall morbidity and other outcomes was comparable among LPD and RPD.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study, increased OT was associated with incremental increases in overall morbidity after PD, irrespective of approach. While MIPD was associated with improved overall morbidity compared to OPD when stratified by OT quartile, higher mortality rates were observed with prolonged OT only with MIPD. Those data suggest that MIPD is a safe alternative to OPD when OT is optimized. NSQIP was used to compare the effect of operative time (OT) on outcomes following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), stratified by approach. Increased OT was associated with inferior outcomes following open, laparoscopic, and robotic PD. Surgeons should attempt to optimize OT, regardless of the approach to PD.",9
576,The fast and forceful kicking strike of the secretary bird,"The study of animal locomotion has uncovered principles that can be applied to bio-inspired robotics, prosthetics and rehabilitation medicine, while also providing insight into musculoskeletal form and function [1-4]. In particular, study of extreme behaviors can reveal mechanical constraints and trade-offs that have influenced evolution of limb form and function [1,2]. Secretary birds (Sagittarius serpentarius; Figure 1A) are large terrestrial birds of prey endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, which feed on snakes, lizards and small mammals [5]. They frequently kick and stamp on the prey's head until it is killed or incapacitated, particularly when dispatching larger lizards and venomous snakes [5]. The consequences of a missed strike when hunting venomous snakes can be deadly [5], so the kicking strikes of secretary birds require fast yet accurate neural control. Delivery of fast, forceful and accurate foot strikes that are sufficient to stun and kill prey requires precision targeting, demanding a high level of coordination between the visual and neuromuscular systems.",7
577,DeepAMR for predicting co-occurrent resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Motivation:
        
      
      Resistance co-occurrence within first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs is a common phenomenon. Existing methods based on genetic data analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) have been able to predict resistance of MTB to individual drugs, but have not considered the resistance co-occurrence and cannot capture latent structure of genomic data that corresponds to lineages.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We used a large cohort of TB patients from 16 countries across six continents where whole-genome sequences for each isolate and associated phenotype to anti-TB drugs were obtained using drug susceptibility testing recommended by the World Health Organization. We then proposed an end-to-end multi-task model with deep denoising auto-encoder (DeepAMR) for multiple drug classification and developed DeepAMR_cluster, a clustering variant based on DeepAMR, for learning clusters in latent space of the data. The results showed that DeepAMR outperformed baseline model and four machine learning models with mean AUROC from 94.4% to 98.7% for predicting resistance to four first-line drugs [i.e. isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA)], multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and pan-susceptible TB (PANS-TB: MTB that is susceptible to all four first-line anti-TB drugs). In the case of INH, EMB, PZA and MDR-TB, DeepAMR achieved its best mean sensitivity of 94.3%, 91.5%, 87.3% and 96.3%, respectively. While in the case of RIF and PANS-TB, it generated 94.2% and 92.2% sensitivity, which were lower than baseline model by 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively. t-SNE visualization shows that DeepAMR_cluster captures lineage-related clusters in the latent space.

578,Orthotopic bladder substitution: Surgical aspects and optimization of outcomes,"Objectives:
        
      
      Orthotopic bladder substitution (OBS) is a management option for urinary diversion in men and women undergoing cystectomy. The aim of the procedure is to provide a functional continent urinary reservoir of adequate capacity, compliance and low pressure. We have provided a narrative review of the existing literature and highlighted areas where improvement and standardization can be recommended.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature search included database search for publications from January 1970 to November 2020, using keywords including OBS, bladder reconstruction, neobladder, radical cystectomy, robotic cystectomy, intracorporeal neobladder, surgical technique, patient selection and outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Due to various factors including indications, operative technique and risk of complications, OBS is an enormous undertaking and commitment for patients, surgeons and health professionals involved in the care pathway. The main considerations for patient selection, the technical elements of the procedure and the rationale behind these are discussed. Previously considered to be a choice for a select few, the inclusion criteria have expanded over the last decade. Similarly, surgical techniques including the choice and configuration of bowel segments, construction of anastomosis and nerve or organ sparing procedures have evolved over the years. Minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic assisted surgery has added further perspectives to the existing literature on OBS. Understanding the principles of operative techniques and assessing the best evidence to influence patient management is crucial as it has a major impact on clinical outcomes. Peri- and post-operative care, focused on the prevention of complications and morbidity, affects long-term functional and oncological outcomes, which ultimately dictates the quality of life.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This concise overview of OBS literature highlights the importance of pre-operative, peri-operative, and post-operative aspects with regards to the optimization of patient care. To achieve the best results, meticulous attention should be paid in all these areas, surgical and multi-disciplinary. Patient education and counseling, with shared decision making are central to the success of the procedure.",2
579,Loss of sensory attenuation in patients with functional (psychogenic) movement disorders,"Functional movement disorders require attention to manifest yet patients report the abnormal movement to be out of their control. In this study we explore the phenomenon of sensory attenuation, a measure of the sense of agency for movement, in this group of patients by using a force matching task. Fourteen patients and 14 healthy control subjects were presented with forces varying from 1 to 3 N on the index finger of their left hand. Participants were required to match these forces; either by pressing directly on their own finger or by operating a robot that pressed on their finger. As expected, we found that healthy control subjects consistently overestimated the force required when pressing directly on their own finger than when operating a robot. However, patients did not, indicating a significant loss of sensory attenuation in this group of patients. These data are important because they demonstrate that a fundamental component of normal voluntary movement is impaired in patients with functional movement disorders. The loss of sensory attenuation has been correlated with the loss of sense of agency, and may help to explain why patients report that they do not experience the abnormal movement as voluntary.",6
580,Outcomes After Minimally-invasive Versus Open Pancreatoduodenectomy: A Pan-European Propensity Score Matched Study,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess short-term outcomes after minimally invasive (laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and hybrid) pancreatoduodenectomy (MIPD) versus open pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD) among European centers.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Current evidence on MIPD is based on national registries or single expert centers. International, matched studies comparing outcomes for MIPD and OPD are lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Retrospective propensity score matched study comparing MIPD in 14 centers (7 countries) performing ≥10 MIPDs annually (2012-2017) versus OPD in 53 German/Dutch surgical registry centers performing ≥10 OPDs annually (2014-2017). Primary outcome was 30-day major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥3).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 4220 patients, 729/730 MIPDs (412 laparoscopic, 184 robot-assisted, and 130 hybrid) were matched to 729 OPDs. Median annual case-volume was 19 MIPDs (interquartile range, IQR 13-22), including the first MIPDs performed in 10/14 centers, and 31 OPDs (IQR 21-38). Major morbidity (28% vs 30%, P = 0.526), mortality (4.0% vs 3.3%, P = 0.576), percutaneous drainage (12% vs 12%, P = 0.809), reoperation (11% vs 13%, P = 0.329), and hospital stay (mean 17 vs 17 days, P > 0.99) were comparable between MIPD and OPD. Grade-B/C postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (23% vs 13%, P < 0.001) occurred more frequently after MIPD. Single-row pancreatojejunostomy was associated with POPF in MIPD (odds ratio, OR 2.95, P < 0.001), but not in OPD. Laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and hybrid MIPD had comparable major morbidity (27% vs 27% vs 35%), POPF (24% vs 19% vs 25%), and mortality (2.9% vs 5.2% vs 5.4%), with a fewer conversions in robot-assisted- versus laparoscopic MIPD (5% vs 26%, P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In the early experience of 14 European centers performing ≥10 MIPDs annually, no differences were found in major morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay between MIPD and OPD. The high rates of POPF and conversion, and the lack of superior outcomes (ie, hospital stay, morbidity) could indicate that more experience and higher annual MIPD volumes are needed.",9
581,Hemicolectomy,"Hemicolectomy is a commonly performed operation for cancer of the colon. The first successful right hemicolectomy was performed in 1832 by Reybard. Since then the technique was subsequently refined by renowned surgeons including Kohler and Mikulicz. In the modern-day, it has become a mainstay to operate laparoscopically, where conditions allow. Robotic techniques are in development and represent the future of minimally invasive surgery for colon cancer. This article will discuss the anatomy, indications, contraindications equipment, personnel, procedure, and interprofessional strategy towards the operation.",3
582,Minimal Invasive Myomectomy with Morcellation for Giant Myoma: A Challenge or a Questionable Approach?,"This study aimed to discuss the possible role of morcellation for a giant myoma in the minimal invasive approach. Current literature, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, was reviewed. We found that safety of morcellation for a giant myoma is questionable. The risk and benefits of morcellation as well as alternative treatment options should be discussed with each individual patient.",0
583,Massive Ascites Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: A Case Report,"Background: Lymph leakage is regarded as one of the rare complications of major abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic surgeries. Lymphangiogram seems to be the principal diagnostic modality. Management strategies that have been shown in the literature range from conservative measures to surgical exploration. However, the rarity and diversity in the presentation of this complication have attributed to the lack of consensus and guideline on its management. Case Presentation: A 49-year-old obese man with prostate-specific antigen of 10 and preoperative Gleason score of 8 prostate cancer and initial staging of T3N0M0 has undergone robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection with unilateral nerve sparing. Our patient was admitted with significant ascites on day 14 postoperative, which was confirmed on CT abdomen and initially managed with nutritional support and percutaneous drainage. A lipidiol lymphangiogram demonstrated lymphatic leakage near the right external iliac vein. While he was awaiting elective surgical exploration, he has had two further successive admissions with massive ascites, anemia and raised C-reactive protein with acute kidney injury. A laparoscopic exploration was performed with interventional radiology assistance to direct dissection to the site of leak. An abscess cavity was found and excised. The lymphatic leak tailed off to insignificance rapidly thereafter. Conclusion: Each case of lymphatic leakage seems to require an individualized approach according to the nature and severity of the lymphatic leak and patient condition. Although it is possible that the collection was infected lymphatic fluid, the position of the abscess cavity in proximity to the site where the lipidiol was seen to leak from the lymphatics suggests that it is possible that the lipidiol was the nidus for infection. Either way what is interesting is that the presence of the abscess caused prolonged and profuse lymphatic leakage.",3
584,Motor cortex guides selection of predictable movement targets,"The present paper asks whether the motor cortex contributes to prediction-based guidance of target selection. This question was inspired by recent evidence that suggests (i) recurrent connections from the motor system into the attentional system may extract movement-relevant perceptual information and (ii) that the motor cortex cannot only generate predictions of the sensory consequences of movements but may also operate as predictor of perceptual events in general. To test this idea we employed a choice reaching task requiring participants to rapidly reach and touch a predictable or unpredictable colour target. Motor cortex activity was modulated via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In Experiment 1 target colour repetitions were predictable. Under such conditions anodal tDCS facilitated selection versus sham and cathodal tDCS. This improvement was apparent for trajectory curvature but not movement initiation. Conversely, where no predictability of colour was embedded reach performance was unaffected by tDCS. Finally, the results of a key-press experiment suggested that motor cortex involvement is restricted to tasks where the predictable target colour is movement-relevant. The outcomes are interpreted as evidence that the motor system contributes to the top-down guidance of selective attention to movement targets.",6
585,"Morbidity and Mortality Following Transoral Robotic Surgery, a Prospective Single Centre Study","To review complications including mortality after transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for both benign and malignant pathologies. This is a prospective observational study. Postoperative haemorrhage (8.7%) was the most common complication and 2 (1.7%) mortality were seen in this study. Airway complications and tracheostomy (1.7%), aspiration pneumonia (1.7%), swallowing problems and nasogastric feeding (7%), intra-operative pharyngocutaneous fistula (0.9%) and transient nasal regurgitation (3.5%) were also seen. The more tissue is removed the more is the risk of complication. Complications were mainly seen in the first year of starting the service of TORS and it is a reflection of the learning curve. However, secondary haemorrhage did not follow any pattern in our series. The postoperative haemorrhage was more common in patients with T2 oropharyngeal carcinoma. The mortality was seen in 2 patients (1.7%) with T2 oropharyngeal carcinoma due to postoperative haemorrhage. Higher T stage of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) needs bigger resection with resultant increase in morbidity.",1
586,The future of endoscopy: Advances in endoscopic image innovations,"The latest state of the art technological innovations have led to a palpable progression in endoscopic imaging and may facilitate standardisation of practice. One of the most rapidly evolving modalities is artificial intelligence with recent studies providing real-time diagnoses and encouraging results in the first randomised trials to conventional endoscopic imaging. Advances in functional hypoxia imaging offer novel opportunities to be used to detect neoplasia and the assessment of colitis. Three-dimensional volumetric imaging provides spatial information and has shown promise in the increased detection of small polyps. Studies to date of self-propelling colonoscopes demonstrate an increased caecal intubation rate and possibly offer patients a more comfortable procedure. Further development in robotic technology has introduced ex vivo automated locomotor upper gastrointestinal and small bowel capsule devices. Eye-tracking has the potential to revolutionise endoscopic training through the identification of differences in experts and non-expert endoscopist as trainable parameters. In this review, we discuss the latest innovations of all these technologies and provide perspective into the exciting future of diagnostic luminal endoscopy.",1
587,Design and Evaluation of a Percutaneous Fragment Manipulation Device for Minimally Invasive Fracture Surgery,"Reduction of fractures in the minimally invasive (MI) manner can avoid risks associated with open fracture surgery. The MI approach requires specialized tools called percutaneous fragment manipulation devices (PFMD) to enable surgeons to safely grasp and manipulate fragments. PFMDs developed for long-bone manipulation are not suitable for intra-articular fractures where small bone fragments are involved. With this study, we offer a solution to potentially move the current fracture management practice closer to the use of a MI approach. We investigate the design and testing of a new PFMD design for manual as well as robot-assisted manipulation of small bone fragments. This new PFMD design is simulated using FEA in three loading scenarios (force/torque: 0 N/2.6 Nm, 75.7 N/3.5 N, 147 N/6.8 Nm) assessing structural properties, breaking points, and maximum bending deformations. The PFMD is tested in a laboratory setting on Sawbones models (0 N/2.6 Nm), and on ex-vivo swine samples (F = 80 N ± 8 N, F = 150 ± 15 N). A commercial optical tracking system was used for measuring PFMD deformations under external loading and the results were verified with an electromagnetic tracking system. The average error difference between the tracking systems was 0.5 mm, being within their accuracy limits. Final results from reduction maneuvers performed both manually and with the robot assistance are obtained from 7 human cadavers with reduction forces in the range of (F = 80 N ± 8 N, F = 150 ± 15 N, respectively). The results show that structurally, the system performs as predicted by the simulation results. The PFMD did not break during ex-vivo and cadaveric trials. Simulation, laboratory, and cadaveric tests produced similar results regarding the PFMD bending. Specifically, for forces applied perpendicularly to the axis of the PFMD of 80 N ± 8 N deformations of 2.8, 2.97, and 3.06 mm are measured on the PFMD, while forces of 150 ± 15 N produced deformations of 5.8, 4.44, and 5.19 mm. This study has demonstrated that the proposed PFMD undergoes predictable deformations under typical bone manipulation loads. Testing of the device on human cadavers proved that these deformations do not affect the anatomic reduction quality. The PFMD is, therefore, suitable to reliably achieve and maintain fracture reductions, and to, consequently, allow external fracture fixation.",4
588,Future Directions,"Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is a novel technique that has evolved over the years to address the challenges of low rectal cancer surgery by applying the principles and benefits of laparoscopic surgery to more historic transanal techniques. It has been popularized through its use in rectal cancer, but the transanal approach is slowly being expanded to tackle different clinical scenarios including benign conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and endometriosis. For all of these new indications, it is the desire to access and begin the dissection in native tissue beyond the pathology which makes this approach applicable to other diseases where anatomy can be challenging. Training pathways to safely introduce taTME in a standardized manner are being developed and implemented in a bid to ensure adequate training to all the surgeons using this technique and thus minimize complications and patient morbidity. The future directions of this promising technique include the use of image and optical technological enhancement to aid navigation, the use of pneumorectum stabilization, and perhaps the use of fluorescence as a safety improvement. Developments have come also from the field of robotics. After a demonstration of feasibility in cadaver models, a growing experience has been gathered in the robotic approach to taTME, covered in the last part of this chapter.",3
589,Enabling the future of colonoscopy with intelligent and autonomous magnetic manipulation,"Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer significantly improves survival. However, over half of cases are diagnosed late due to demand exceeding the capacity for colonoscopy - the ""gold standard"" for screening. Colonoscopy is limited by the outdated design of conventional endoscopes, associated with high complexity of use, cost and pain. Magnetic endoscopes represent a promising alternative, overcoming drawbacks of pain and cost, but struggle to reach the translational stage as magnetic manipulation is complex and unintuitive. In this work, we use machine vision to develop intelligent and autonomous control of a magnetic endoscope, for the first time enabling non-expert users to effectively perform magnetic colonoscopy in-vivo. We combine the use of robotics, computer vision and advanced control to offer an intuitive and effective endoscopic system. Moreover, we define the characteristics required to achieve autonomy in robotic endoscopy. The paradigm described here can be adopted in a variety of applications where navigation in unstructured environments is required, such as catheters, pancreatic endoscopy, bronchoscopy, and gastroscopy. This work brings alternative endoscopic technologies closer to the translational stage, increasing availability of early-stage cancer treatments.",0
590,Feasibility and safety of radical prostatectomy for oligo-metastatic prostate cancer: the Testing Radical prostatectomy in men with prostate cancer and oligo-Metastases to the bone (TRoMbone) trial,"Objectives:
        
      
      To test the feasibility of randomisation to radical prostatectomy (RP) plus pelvic lymphadenectomy in addition to standard-of-care (SOC) systemic therapy in men with newly diagnosed oligo-metastatic prostate cancer.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      A prospective, randomised, non-blinded, feasibility clinical trial with an embedded QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) to optimise recruitment was conducted in nine nationwide tertiary care centres undertaking high-volume robotic surgery. We aimed to randomise 50 men with synchronous oligo-metastatic prostate cancer within an 18-month recruitment period to SOC systemic therapy vs SOC plus RP (intervention arm). The main outcome measures were: ability to randomise patients, optimised by a QRI; EuroQoL five Dimensions five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires to capture quality-of-life (QoL) data at baseline and 3 months post-randomisation; routine clinicopathological assessment to capture adverse events and prostate-specific antigen in both arms, plus standard perioperative parameters in the surgical arm.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 51 men were randomised within 14 months (one was subsequently deemed ineligible), with 60-83% accrual rate in centres that recruited at least two patients. All patients completed the trial follow-up; one patient in the intervention arm subsequently did not undergo the surgical intervention and one in the SOC arm refused all therapies. The QRI positively impacted recruitment. QoL data showed similarly high functioning in both study arms. Surgery for men with oligo-metastatic prostate cancer was found to be safe and had similar impact on early functional outcomes as surgery for standard indication.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is feasible to randomise men with synchronous oligo-metastatic prostate cancer to a surgical intervention in addition to standard systemic therapies. While surgery appeared safe with no substantial impact on QoL in this feasibility study, a large randomised controlled trial is now warranted to examine treatment effectiveness of this additional component in the multimodality management of oligo-metastatic prostate cancer.",0
591,Keep focussing: striatal dopamine multiple functions resolved in a single mechanism tested in a simulated humanoid robot,"The effects of striatal dopamine (DA) on behavior have been widely investigated over the past decades, with ""phasic"" burst firings considered as the key expression of a reward prediction error responsible for reinforcement learning. Less well studied is ""tonic"" DA, where putative functions include the idea that it is a regulator of vigor, incentive salience, disposition to exert an effort and a modulator of approach strategies. We present a model combining tonic and phasic DA to show how different outflows triggered by either intrinsically or extrinsically motivating stimuli dynamically affect the basal ganglia by impacting on a selection process this system performs on its cortical input. The model, which has been tested on the simulated humanoid robot iCub interacting with a mechatronic board, shows the putative functions ascribed to DA emerging from the combination of a standard computational mechanism coupled to a differential sensitivity to the presence of DA across the striatum.",4
592,Atypical interference effect of action observation in autism spectrum conditions,"Background:
        
      
      Observing incongruent actions interferes with ongoing action execution. This 'interference effect' is larger for observed biological actions than for non-biological actions. The current study used virtual reality to investigate the biological specificity of interference effects of action observation in autism spectrum conditions (ASC).
    


          Method:
        
      
      High-functioning adults with ASC and age- and IQ-matched healthy controls performed horizontal sinusoidal arm movements whilst observing arm movements conducted by a virtual reality agent with either human or robot form, which moved with either biological motion or at a constant velocity. In another condition, participants made the same arm movements while observing a real human. Observed arm movements were either congruent or incongruent with executed arm movements. An interference effect was calculated as the average variance in the incongruent action dimension during observation of incongruent compared with congruent movements.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Control participants exhibited an interference effect when observing real human and virtual human agent incongruent movements but not when observing virtual robot agent movements. Individuals with ASC differed from controls in that they showed no interference effects for real human, virtual human or virtual robot movements.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The current study demonstrates atypical interference effects in ASC.",4
593,Intentional machines: A defence of trust in medical artificial intelligence,"Trust constitutes a fundamental strategy to deal with risks and uncertainty in complex societies. In line with the vast literature stressing the importance of trust in doctor-patient relationships, trust is therefore regularly suggested as a way of dealing with the risks of medical artificial intelligence (AI). Yet, this approach has come under charge from different angles. At least two lines of thought can be distinguished: (1) that trusting AI is conceptually confused, that is, that we cannot trust AI; and (2) that it is also dangerous, that is, that we should not trust AI-particularly if the stakes are as high as they routinely are in medicine. In this paper, we aim to defend a notion of trust in the context of medical AI against both charges. To do so, we highlight the technically mediated intentions manifest in AI systems, rendering trust a conceptually plausible stance for dealing with them. Based on literature from human-robot interactions, psychology and sociology, we then propose a novel model to analyse notions of trust, distinguishing between three aspects: reliability, competence, and intentions. We discuss each aspect and make suggestions regarding how medical AI may become worthy of our trust.",0
594,Abnormal microscale neuronal connectivity triggered by a proprioceptive stimulus in dystonia,"We investigated modulation of functional neuronal connectivity by a proprioceptive stimulus in sixteen young people with dystonia and eight controls. A robotic wrist interface delivered controlled passive wrist extension movements, the onset of which was synchronised with scalp EEG recordings. Data were segmented into epochs around the stimulus and up to 160 epochs per subject were averaged to produce a Stretch Evoked Potential (StretchEP). Event-related network dynamics were estimated using a methodology that features Wavelet Transform Coherency (WTC). Global Microscale Nodal Strength (GMNS) was introduced to estimate overall engagement of areas into short-lived networks related to the StretchEP, and Global Connectedness (GC) estimated the spatial extent of the StretchEP networks. Dynamic Connectivity Maps showed a striking difference between dystonia and controls, with particularly strong theta band event-related connectivity in dystonia. GC also showed a trend towards higher values in dystonia than controls. In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of this method to investigate event-related neuronal connectivity in relation to a proprioceptive stimulus in a paediatric patient population. Young people with dystonia show an exaggerated network response to a proprioceptive stimulus, displaying both excessive theta-band synchronisation across the sensorimotor network and widespread engagement of cortical regions in the activated network.",6
595,The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) radical prostatectomy audit 2014/2015 - an update on current practice and outcomes by centre and surgeon case-volume,"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe contemporary radical prostatectomy (RP) practice using the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) data and audit project and to observe differences in practice in relation to surgeon or centre case-volume.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Data on 13 920 RP procedures performed by 179 surgeons across 86 centres were recorded on the BAUS data and audit platform between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. This equates to ~95% of total RPs performed over this period when compared to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. Centre case-volumes were categorised as 'high' (>200), 'medium' (100-200) and 'low' (<100); surgeon case-volumes were categorised as 'high' (>100) and 'low' (<100). Differences in surgical practice and selected outcome measures were observed between groups. All data and volume categories were for the combined 2-year period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median number of RPs performed over the 2-year period was 63.5 per surgeon and 164 per centre. Overall, surgical approach was robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP) in 65%, laparoscopic RP (LRP) in 23%, and open RP (ORP) in 12%. The dominant approach in high-case-volume centres and by high-case-volume surgeons was RALP (74.3% and 69.2%, respectively). There was a greater percentage of ORPs reported by low-volume surgeons and centres when compared to higher volume equivalents. In all, 51.6% of all patients in this series underwent RP in high-case-volume centres using robot-assisted surgery (RAS). High-case-volume surgeons performed nerve-sparing (NS) procedures on 57.3% of their cases; low-volume surgeons performing NS on 48.2%. Overall, lymph node dissection (LND) rates were very similar across the groups. An 'extended' LND was more commonly performed in high-volume centres (22.1%). The median length of stay (LOS) was lowest in patients undergoing RALP at high-volume centres (1 day) and highest in ORP across all volume categories (3-4 days). Reported pT2 positive surgical margin (PSM) rate varied by technique, centre volume, and surgeon volume. In general, observed PSM rates were lower when RALP was the surgical approach (14.4%) and when high-volume surgeons were compared to low-volume surgeons (13.6% vs 17.7%). Transfusion rates were highest in ORP across all centres and surgeons (2.96-4.49%) compared to techniques using a minimally-invasive approach (0.25-2.41%). Training cases ranged from 0.5% in low-volume centres to 6.0% in high-volume centres.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Compliance with data registration for centres and surgeons performing RP is high in the present series. Most RPs were performed in high-case-volume centres and by high-case-volume surgeons, with the most common approaches being minimally invasive and specifically RAS. High-case-volume centres and surgeons reported higher rates of extended LND and training cases. Higher-case-volume surgeons reported lower pT2 PSM rates, whilst the most marked differences in transfusion rates and LOS were seen when ORP was compared to minimally invasive approaches. Caution must be applied when interpreting these differences on the basis of this being registry data - causality cannot be assumed.",2
596,Changes to serum sample tube and processing methodology does not cause Intra-Individual [corrected] variation in automated whole serum N-glycan profiling in health and disease,"Introduction:
        
      
      Serum N-glycans have been identified as putative biomarkers for numerous diseases. The impact of different serum sample tubes and processing methods on N-glycan analysis has received relatively little attention. This study aimed to determine the effect of different sample tubes and processing methods on the whole serum N-glycan profile in both health and disease. A secondary objective was to describe a robot automated N-glycan release, labeling and cleanup process for use in a biomarker discovery system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      25 patients with active and quiescent inflammatory bowel disease and controls had three different serum sample tubes taken at the same draw. Two different processing methods were used for three types of tube (with and without gel-separation medium). Samples were randomised and processed in a blinded fashion. Whole serum N-glycan release, 2-aminobenzamide labeling and cleanup was automated using a Hamilton Microlab STARlet Liquid Handling robot. Samples were analysed using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/ethylene bridged hybrid(BEH) column on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography instrument. Data were analysed quantitatively by pairwise correlation and hierarchical clustering using the area under each chromatogram peak. Qualitatively, a blinded assessor attempted to match chromatograms to each individual.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was small intra-individual variation in serum N-glycan profiles from samples collected using different sample processing methods. Intra-individual correlation coefficients were between 0.99 and 1. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analyses accurately matched samples from the same individual. Qualitative analysis demonstrated good chromatogram overlay and a blinded assessor was able to accurately match individuals based on chromatogram profile, regardless of disease status.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The three different serum sample tubes processed using the described methods cause minimal inter-individual variation in serum whole N-glycan profile when processed using an automated workstream. This has important implications for N-glycan biomarker discovery studies using different serum processing standard operating procedures.",7
597,Evaluating the effectiveness of digital communication within the National Medication Safety Network for England,"Objectives:
        
      
      The medication safety officer (MSO) role was created following a patient safety alert, with an action for MSOs to be active participants in a national network in England, which included regular online webinar meetings and an online forum. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of digital platforms in facilitating interaction and communication by the MSO network. The objectives were to establish the proportion of MSOs who interact through monthly webinars and the online forum. A secondary objective was to identify barriers and facilitators for engaging digitally within the MSO network.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An online survey was used alongside semistructured interviews. The online survey was disseminated to all 400 MSOs registered with the UK Department of Health Central Alerting System from December 2018 to February 2019. Interviewees were identified purposively through snowball sampling and voluntarily through the survey.
    


          Results:
        
      
      84 MSOs responded to the survey (21% response rate) and 10 participated in the semistructured interviews. The majority of the respondents were pharmacists (79/84, 94%) from NHS large healthcare providers (44/84, 52%). MSO respondents (61/84, 73%) joined the monthly webinar and 47/84 (56%) believed the webinar was useful for networking. Ten (12%) did not attend the webinars due to technical difficulties or lack of time. The online forum was used less frequently, with a third (27/84, 32%) that had never used it.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Digital communications through webinars and online forums were perceived by respondents as a way to facilitate networking but require a robust information technology infrastructure that can be accessed without difficulty. User-friendly platforms can help the MSO network achieve critical mass and greater interaction, allowing timely access to information.",3
598,Trust Development in Military and Civilian Human-Agent Teams: The Effect of Social-Cognitive Recovery Strategies,"Autonomous agents (AA) will increasingly be deployed as teammates instead of tools. In many operational situations, flawless performance from AA cannot be guaranteed. This may lead to a breach in the human's trust, which can compromise collaboration. This highlights the importance of thinking about how to deal with error and trust violations when designing AA. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of uncertainty communication and apology on the development of trust in a Human-Agent Team (HAT) when there is a trust violation. Two experimental studies following the same method were performed with (I) a civilian group and (II) a military group of participants. The online task environment resembled a house search in which the participant was accompanied and advised by an AA as their artificial team member. Halfway during the task, an incorrect advice evoked a trust violation. Uncertainty communication was manipulated within-subjects, apology between-subjects. Our results showed that (a) communicating uncertainty led to higher levels of trust in both studies, (b) an incorrect advice by the agent led to a less severe decline in trust when that advice included a measure of uncertainty, and (c) after a trust violation, trust recovered significantly more when the agent offered an apology. The two latter effects were only found in the civilian study. We conclude that tailored agent communication is a key factor in minimizing trust reduction in face of agent failure to maintain effective long-term relationships in HATs. The difference in findings between participant groups emphasizes the importance of considering the (organizational) culture when designing artificial team members.",4
599,Automated Vision-Based Microsurgical Skill Analysis in Neurosurgery Using Deep Learning: Development and Preclinical Validation,"Background/objective:
        
      
      Technical skill acquisition is an essential component of neurosurgical training. Educational theory suggests that optimal learning and improvement in performance depends on the provision of objective feedback. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a vision-based framework based on a novel representation of surgical tool motion and interactions capable of automated and objective assessment of microsurgical skill.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Videos were obtained from 1 expert, 6 intermediate, and 12 novice surgeons performing arachnoid dissection in a validated clinical model using a standard operating microscope. A mask region convolutional neural network framework was used to segment the tools present within the operative field in a recorded video frame. Tool motion analysis was achieved using novel triangulation metrics. Performance of the framework in classifying skill levels was evaluated using the area under the curve and accuracy. Objective measures of classifying the surgeons' skill level were also compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The area under the curve was 0.977 and the accuracy was 84.21%. A number of differences were found, which included experts having a lower median dissector velocity (P = 0.0004; 190.38 ms-1 vs. 116.38 ms-1), and a smaller inter-tool tip distance (median 46.78 vs. 75.92; P = 0.0002) compared with novices.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Automated and objective analysis of microsurgery is feasible using a mask region convolutional neural network, and a novel tool motion and interaction representation. This may support technical skills training and assessment in neurosurgery.",1
600,Sexual dysfunction following rectal cancer surgery,"Introduction:
        
      
      Sexual and urological problems after surgery for rectal cancer are common, multifactorial, inadequately discussed, and untreated. The urogenital function is dependent on dual autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation, and four key danger zones exist that are at risk for nerve damage during colorectal surgery: one of these sites is in the abdomen and three are in the pelvis. The aim of this study is to systematically review the epidemiology of sexual dysfunction following rectal cancer surgery, to describe the anatomical basis of autonomic nerve-preserving techniques, and to explore the scientific evidence available to support the laparoscopic or robotic approach over open surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      According to the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search of studies evaluating sexual function in patients undergoing rectal surgery for cancer was performed in Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An increasing number of studies assessing the incidence and prevalence of sexual dysfunction following multimodality treatment for rectal cancer has been published over the last 30 years. Significant heterogeneity in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction is reported in the literature, with rates between 5 and 90%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is no evidence to date in favor of any surgical approach (open vs laparoscopic vs robotic). Standardized diagnostic tools should be routinely used to prospectively assess sexual function in patients undergoing rectal surgery.",2
601,Grip force when reaching with target uncertainty provides evidence for motor optimization over averaging,"When presented with competing potential reach targets and required to launch a movement before knowing which one will be cued as the target, people initially reach in the average target direction. Although this spatial averaging could arise from executing a weighted average of motor plans for the potential targets, it could also arise from planning a single, optimal movement. To test between these alternatives we used a task in which participants were required to reach to either a single target or towards two potential targets while grasping an object. A robotic device applied a lateral elastic load to the object requiring large grip forces for reaches to targets either side of midline and a minimal grip force for midline movements. As expected, in trials with two targets located either side of midline, participants initially reached straight ahead. Critically, on these trials the initial grip force was minimal, appropriate for the midline movement, and not the average of the large grip forces required for movements to the individual targets. These results indicate that under conditions of target uncertainty, people do not execute an average of planned actions but rather a single movement that optimizes motor costs.",7
602,The perception of scar cosmesis following thyroid and parathyroid surgery: A prospective cohort study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Various ""scarless"" approaches have been described for thyroid and parathyroid surgery. The objective of the current study was to investigate patients' perception of neck scar cosmesis, its impact on quality of life (QoL) and evaluate patient preference with regards to scar location.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      120 patients undergoing thyroid or parathyroid surgery were followed-up over a 5-year period (2008-2013). Validated tools were used to assess scar perception and its impact on QoL. These were evaluated against sex, age, ethnicity, operation type, histopathology, time following surgery and scar length.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean follow-up was 2.6 ± 3.8 years. One of the most common post-operative problems was scar-related (n = 18). Caucasian patients and those with benign histology expressed a lower impact on QoL (p < 0.001, p = 0.038). Sex and scar length did not significantly affect patients' perception for scar cosmesis (p > 0.05). Clinicians tended to score scar cosmesis higher than patients (p = 0.02). Most participants (75%) expressed a clear preference for an extracervical ""scar-less in the neck"" approach.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Scar-related issues are frequently reported following thyroid and parathyroid surgery. The negative impact, often underestimated by clinicians, is more apparent amongst Asian and Afro-Caribbean patients and can significantly impact on their QoL. This, combined with the lack of correlation between scar length and patient satisfaction, indicates the need to divert research from miniaturising neck scars to concealing them in extracervical sites.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Patients prefer a scar-less in the neck approach when given the option. A prospective comparative study is required to compare the cervical and extracervical approaches.",1
603,An Ungrounded Hand-Held Surgical Device Incorporating Active Constraints with Force-Feedback,"This paper presents an ungrounded, hand-held surgical device that incorporates active constraints and force-feedback. Optical tracking of the device and embedded actuation allow for real-time motion compensation of a surgical tool as an active constraint is encountered. The active constraints can be made soft, so that the surgical tool tip motion is scaled, or rigid, so as to altogether prevent the penetration of the active constraint. Force-feedback is also provided to the operator so as to indicate penetration of the active constraint boundary by the surgical tool. The device has been evaluated in detailed bench tests to quantify its motion scaling and force-feedback capabilities. The combined effects of force-feedback and motion compensation are demonstrated during palpation of an active constraint with rigid and soft boundaries. A user study evaluated the combined effect of motion compensation and force-feedback in preventing penetration of a rigid active constraint. The results have shown the potential of the device operating in an ungrounded setup that incorporates active constraints with force-feedback.",6
604,Artificial intelligence for good health: a scoping review of the ethics literature,"Background:
        
      
      Artificial intelligence (AI) has been described as the ""fourth industrial revolution"" with transformative and global implications, including in healthcare, public health, and global health. AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective?
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.",1
605,Systemic inflammatory changes and their clinical implications following thoracic cancer surgery,"Trauma that follows every surgical procedure triggers an inflammatory response, which in the majority of the cases reflects the associated tissue damage. Tissue regeneration, postoperative outcomes, and systemic antibacterial activity are highly dependent on the initial inflammatory response elicited by surgical trauma. More specifically, in thoracic surgery, systemic cytokine and cellular changes have an impact on several measured postoperative outcomes. Lastly, the introduction of video-assisted and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery has been shown to provide improved postoperative outcomes with altered systemic inflammatory response, when compared to open thoracic surgery. This review outlines the major systemic inflammatory changes observed in thoracic cancer surgery as well as its clinical significance.",1
606,Experience Measures after Radical Prostatectomy: A Register-Based Study Evaluating the Association between Patient-Reported Symptoms and Quality of Information,"Patient-reported data are important for quality assurance and improvement. Our main aim was to investigate the association between patient-reported symptoms among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and their perceived quality of information before treatment. In this single-centre study, 235 men treated with robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) between August 2017 and June 2019, responded to a follow-up questionnaire 20-42 months after surgery. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between patient-reported symptoms, measured with Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP), and the perceived quality of information. Adverse effects were defined as a higher EPIC score at follow-up than at baseline. The majority (77%) rated the general information as good. Higher EPIC-CP at follow-up was significantly associated with lower perceived quality of information, also after adjustment for age and level of education (bivariate model OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07; 1.16, p &lt; 0.001 and multiple model OR 1.12 95% CI 1.08; 1.17, p &lt; 0.001). The share who rated information as good was almost identical among those who reported more symptoms after treatment and those who reported less symptoms (78.3% and 79.2%). Consequently, adverse effects could not explain the results. Our findings suggest a need for improvement of preoperative communication.",5
607,Searching for the Least Invasive Management of Pelvi-Ureteric Junction Obstruction in Children: A Critical Literature Review of Comparative Outcomes,"Introduction: To review the published evidence on the minimally invasive pyeloplasty techniques available currently with particular emphasis on the comparative data about the various minimally invasive alternatives to treat pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and gauge if one should be favored under certain circumstances. Materials and Methods: Non-systematic review of literature on open and minimally invasive pyeloplasty including various kinds of laparoscopic procedures, the robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty, and endourological procedures. Results: Any particular minimally invasive pyeloplasty procedure seems feasible in experienced hands, irrespective of age including infants. Comparative data suggest that the robotic-assisted procedure has gained wider acceptance mainly because it is ergonomically more suited to surgeon well-being and facilitates advanced skills with dexterity thanks to 7 degrees of freedom. However, costs remain the major drawback of robotic surgery. In young children and infants, instead, open surgery can be performed via a relatively small incision and quicker time frame. Conclusions: The best approach for pyeloplasty is still a matter of debate. The robotic approach has gained increasing acceptance over the last years with major advantages of the surgeon well-being and ergonomics and the ease of suturing. Evidence, however, may favor the use of open surgery in infancy.",1
608,Review of the Factors Affecting Acceptance of AI-Infused Systems,"Objective:
        
      
      The study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the factors impacting technology adoption, to predict the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Although the acceptance of AI devices is usually defined by behavioural factors in theories of user acceptance, the effects of technical and human factors are often overlooked. However, research shows that user behaviour can vary depending on a system's technical characteristics and differences in users.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted. A total of 85 peer-reviewed journal articles that met the inclusion criteria and provided information on the factors influencing the adoption of AI devices were selected for the analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Research on the adoption of AI devices shows that users' attitudes, trust and perceptions about the technology can be improved by increasing transparency, compatibility, and reliability, and simplifying tasks. Moreover, technological factors are also important for reducing issues related to human factors (e.g. distrust, scepticism, inexperience) and supporting users with lower intention to use and lower trust in AI-infused systems.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      As prior research has confirmed the interrelationship among factors with and without behaviour theories, this review suggests extending the technology acceptance model that integrates the factors studied in this review to define the acceptance of AI devices across different application areas. However, further research is needed to collect more data and validate the study's findings.
    


          Application:
        
      
      A comprehensive overview of factors influencing the acceptance of AI devices could help researchers and practitioners evaluate user behaviour when adopting new technologies.",4
609,Robotic multiquadrant colorectal procedures: A single-center experience and a systematic review of the literature,"Purpose:
        
      
      Robotic surgery has been progressively implemented for colorectal procedures but is still limited for multiquadrant abdominal resections. The present study aims to describe our experience in robotic multiquadrant colorectal surgeries and provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature investigating the outcomes of robotic total proctocolectomy (TPC), total colectomy (TC), subtotal colectomy (STC), or completion proctectomy (CP) compared to laparoscopy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      At our institution 16 consecutive patients underwent a 2- or 3-stage totally robotic total proctocolectomy (TPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A systematic review of the literature was performed to select studies on robotic and laparoscopic multiquadrant colorectal procedures. Meta-analyses were used to compare the two approaches.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In our case series, 14/16 patients underwent a 2-stage robotic TPC for ulcerative colitis with a mean operative time of 271.42 (SD:37.95) minutes. No conversion occurred. Two patients developed postoperative complications. The mean hospital stay was 8.28 (SD:1.47) days with no readmissions. Mortality was nil. All patients underwent loop-ileostomy closure, and functional outcomes were satisfactory. The literature appraisal was based on 23 retrospective studies, including 736 robotic and 9,904 laparoscopic multiquadrant surgeries. In the robotic group, 36 patients underwent STC, 371 TC, 166 TPC, and 163 CP. Pooled data analysis showed that robotic TC and STC had a lower conversion rate (OR = 0.17;95% CI, 0.04-0.82; p = 0.03) than laparoscopic TC and STC. The robotic approach was associated with longer operative time for TC and STC (MD = 104.64;95% CI, 18.42-190.87; p = 0.02) and TPC and CP (MD = 38.8;95% CI, 18.7-59.06; p = 0.0002), with no differences for postoperative complications and hospital stay. Reports on urological outcomes, sexual dysfunction, and quality of life were missing.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our experience and the literature suggest that robotic multiquadrant colorectal surgery is safe and effective, with low morbidity and mortality rates. Nevertheless, the overall level of evidence is low, and functional outcomes of robotic approach remain largely unknown.

610,Early ileostomy reversal after minimally invasive surgery and ERAS program for mid and low rectal cancer,"Diverting loop ileostomy following low anterior resection (LAR) is known to decrease quality of life and prolongs the return back to patients' baseline activity. The aim of this retrospective study was to explore feasibility and safety of an early ileostomy reversal strategy in a cohort of patients undergoing minimally invasive LAR within an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program. Prospectively collected data from 15 patients who underwent minimally invasive LAR and diverting ileostomy at the Division of General and Hepatobiliary Surgery, University of Verona Hospital Trust between September 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Of 15 patients, 10 patients underwent laparoscopic LAR and 5 patients a robot-assisted procedure. Post-operative complications were observed in 5 patients. Four patients suffered Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2 complications, and one patient required redo surgery due to bowel obstruction at the ileostomy site (grade 3b). Following ileostomy reversal, 10 out of 15 patients experienced complications. Two patients required redo surgery for bowel obstruction (grade 3b), whilst eight patients suffered grade 1 or 2 complications, being surgical site infection the most frequently observed (6 cases). Despite that, 80% of patients had their ileostomy reversed within 30 days and median time from initial surgery to ileostomy reversal was 22 days (range 10-150). Early ileostomy closure after minimally invasive LAR and ERAS program is feasible although it carries non-negligible risk of severe complications which, however, does not hinder its accomplishment.",9
611,"Virtual classroom proficiency-based progression for robotic surgery training (VROBOT): a randomised, prospective, cross-over, effectiveness study","Robotic surgery training has lacked evidence-based standardisation. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of adjunctive interactive virtual classroom training (VCT) in concordance with the self-directed Fundamentals of Robotic Surgery (FRS) curriculum. The virtual classroom is comprised of a studio with multiple audio-visual inputs to which participants can connect remotely via the BARCO weConnect platform. Eleven novice surgical trainees were randomly allocated to two training groups (A and B). In week 1, both groups completed a robotic skills induction. In week 2, Group A received training with the FRS curriculum and adjunctive VCT; Group B only received access to the FRS curriculum. In week 3, the groups received the alternate intervention. The primary outcome was measured using the validated robotic-objective structured assessment of technical skills (R-OSAT) at the end of week 2 (time-point 1) and 3 (time-point 2). All participants completed the training curriculum and were included in the final analyses. At time-point 1, Group A achieved a statistically significant greater mean proficiency score compared to Group B (44.80 vs 35.33 points, p = 0.006). At time-point 2, there was no significant difference in mean proficiency score in Group A from time-point 1. In contrast, Group B, who received further adjunctive VCT showed significant improvement in mean proficiency by 9.67 points from time-point 1 (95% CI 5.18-14.15, p = 0.003). VCT is an effective, accessible training adjunct to self-directed robotic skills training. With the steep learning curve in robotic surgery training, VCT offers interactive, expert-led learning and can increase training effectiveness and accessibility.",6
612,Real-time tool to layer distance estimation for robotic subretinal injection using intraoperative 4D OCT,"The emergence of robotics could enable ophthalmic microsurgical procedures that were previously not feasible due to the precision limits of manual delivery, for example, targeted subretinal injection. Determining the distance between the needle tip, the internal limiting membrane (ILM), and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) both precisely and reproducibly is required for safe and successful robotic retinal interventions. Recent advances in intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) have opened the path for 4D image-guided surgery by providing near video-rate imaging with micron-level resolution to visualize retinal structures, surgical instruments, and tool-tissue interactions. In this work, we present a novel pipeline to precisely estimate the distance between the injection needle and the surface boundaries of two retinal layers, the ILM and the RPE, from iOCT volumes. To achieve high computational efficiency, we reduce the analysis to the relevant area around the needle tip. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment the tool surface, as well as the retinal layer boundaries from selected iOCT B-scans within this tip area. This results in the generation and processing of 3D surface point clouds for the tool, ILM and RPE from the B-scan segmentation maps, which in turn allows the estimation of the minimum distance between the resulting tool and layer point clouds. The proposed method is evaluated on iOCT volumes from ex-vivo porcine eyes and achieves an average error of 9.24 µm and 8.61 µm measuring the distance from the needle tip to the ILM and the RPE, respectively. The results demonstrate that this approach is robust to the high levels of noise present in iOCT B-scans and is suitable for the interventional use case by providing distance feedback at an average update rate of 15.66 Hz.",0
613,A constrained-condylar fixed-bearing total knee arthroplasty is stabilised by the medial soft tissues,"Purpose:
        
      
      Revision constrained-condylar total knee arthroplasty (CCK-TKA) is often used to provide additional mechanical constraint after failure of a primary TKA. However, it is unknown how much this translates to a reliance on soft-tissue support. The aim of this study was therefore to compare the laxity of a native knee to the CCK-TKA implanted state and quantify how medial soft-tissues stabilise the knee following CCK-TKA.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Ten intact cadaveric knees were tested in a robotic system at 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° flexion with ± 90 N anterior-posterior force, ± 8 Nm varus-valgus and ± 5 Nm internal-external torques. A fixed-bearing CCK-TKA was implanted and the laxity tests were repeated with the soft tissues intact and after sequential cutting. The deep and superficial medial collateral ligaments (dMCL, sMCL) and posteromedial capsule (PMC) were sequentially transected and the percentage contributions of each structure to restraining the applied loads were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Implanting a CCK-TKA did not alter anterior-posterior laxity from that of the original native knee, but it significantly decreased internal-external and varus-valgus rotational laxity (p < 0.05). Post CCK-TKA, the sMCL restrained 34% of the tibial displacing load in anterior drawer, 16% in internal rotation, 17% in external rotation and 53% in valgus, across the flexion angles tested. The dMCL restrained 11% of the valgus rotation moment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      With a fully-competent sMCL in-vitro, a fixed-bearing CCK-TKA knee provided more rotational constraint than the native knee. The robotic test data showed that both the soft-tissues and the semi-constrained implant restrained rotational knee laxity. Therefore, in clinical practice, a fixed-bearing CCK-TKA knee could be indicated for use in a knee with lax, less-competent medial soft tissues.

614,Active Inference: Demystified and Compared,"Active inference is a first principle account of how autonomous agents operate in dynamic, nonstationary environments. This problem is also considered in reinforcement learning, but limited work exists on comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this letter, we provide (1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are generally engineered in reinforcement learning, and (2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference and reinforcement learning on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of reinforcement learning. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration-and account for uncertainty about their environment-in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an explicit reward signal in reinforcement learning is removed in active inference, where reward can simply be treated as another observation we have a preference over; even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning agents and by placing zero prior preferences over rewards and learning the prior preferences over the observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings (e.g., robotic arm movement, Atari games) if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside reinforcement learning agents.",4
615,Robotic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer,"Master-slave manipulators (otherwise known as telemanipulators) were introduced into minimally invasive surgery in the 1990s to overcome the limitations of laparoscopic surgery. This led to the development of the first robotic surgical systems which, over the last 10 years, have rapidly gained acceptance among colorectal surgeons. Advantages of robotic surgical systems such as superior instrumentation and field of vision enable precise dissection in confined spaces such as the pelvis, which make it a particularly attractive tool for rectal surgery. The feasibility and safety of robotic rectal surgery is now well established and there is increasing evidence that it might offer superior peri- and postoperative outcomes when compared to laparoscopic rectal surgery. Robotic rectal surgery is easier to learn than laparoscopic surgery and the creation of a structured training program for robotic rectal surgery in Europe has facilitated the learning of this technique in an environment that promotes patient safety and improved patient outcomes through equipment fidelity and operator skill. It is foreseeable that in the near future robotic systems will become part of routine surgical practice in colorectal surgery.",1
616,The evolution of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy: where are we now?,"Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy has evolved over time, fulfilling a widening diagnostic and therapeutic remit. As our understanding of colorectal cancer and its prevention has improved, endoscopy has progressed with improved diagnostic technologies and advancing endoscopic therapies. Despite this, the fundamental design of the endoscope has remained similar since its inception. This review presents the important role lower gastrointestinal endoscopy serves in the prevention of colorectal cancer and the desirable characteristics of the endoscope that would enhance this. A brief history of the endoscope is presented. Current and future robotic endoscopic platforms, which may fulfil these desirable characteristics, are discussed. The incorporation of new technologies from allied scientific disciplines will help the endoscope fulfil its maximum potential in preventing the increasing global burden of colorectal cancer. There are a number of endoscopic platforms under development, which show significant promise.",0

As HEJ editor, Jonathan Baillie, discovered, when he met, a few weeks before its completion, with one of the vascular surgeons who championed it, and the Trust's associate director for Surgical Services, who wrote the business case, the surgical suite makes the MRI the UK's first hospital equipped with two adjacent full hybrid theatres utilising a robotic imaging system, with a fully flexible, synchronised operating table.",1
618,Somatotopic Mapping of the Developing Sensorimotor Cortex in the Preterm Human Brain,"In the mature mammalian brain, the primary somatosensory and motor cortices are known to be spatially organized such that neural activity relating to specific body parts can be somatopically mapped onto an anatomical ""homunculus"". This organization creates an internal body representation which is fundamental for precise motor control, spatial awareness and social interaction. Although it is unknown when this organization develops in humans, animal studies suggest that it may emerge even before the time of normal birth. We therefore characterized the somatotopic organization of the primary sensorimotor cortices using functional MRI and a set of custom-made robotic tools in 35 healthy preterm infants aged from 31 + 6 to 36 + 3 weeks postmenstrual age. Functional responses induced by somatosensory stimulation of the wrists, ankles, and mouth had a distinct spatial organization as seen in the characteristic mature homunculus map. In comparison to the ankle, activation related to wrist stimulation was significantly larger and more commonly involved additional areas including the supplementary motor area and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. These results are in keeping with early intrinsic determination of a somatotopic map within the primary sensorimotor cortices. This may explain why acquired brain injury in this region during the preterm period cannot be compensated for by cortical reorganization and therefore can lead to long-lasting motor and sensory impairment.",6

      To evaluate the range and scientific nature of oral presentations in the Scientific Program of IAPSCON from 2014-18.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The oral presentations in Scientific Program of IAPSCON from 2014 - 18 were tabulated and categorised as per: type of presentation, Paediatric Surgery related clinical subject heading, nature of the content and scientific quality as per Oxford levels of clinical evidence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Most oral presentations were in the form of Short papers. The most common clinical section and clinical condition presented were Urology and Hypospadias respectively. Clinical management followed by operative management represent the majority of the presentations when categorized by the type of content. Certain sections of clinical practice were not represented at all, notably anterior abdominal wall defects and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Most presentations (82.5%) are in Level 4 and 5 as per Oxford levels of clinical evidence, with Levels 1-3 accounting for 5% of presentations. Minimally Invasive Surgery (including robotic) accounted for 8.4% presentations.

621,Negative mpMRI Rules Out Extra-Prostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,"Background: The accuracy of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) in the pre-operative staging of prostate cancer (PCa) remains controversial. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of mpMRI to accurately predict PCa extra-prostatic extension (EPE) on a side-specific basis using a risk-stratified 5-point Likert scale. This study also aimed to assess the influence of mpMRI scan quality on diagnostic accuracy. Patients and Methods: We included 124 men who underwent robot-assisted RP (RARP) as part of the NeuroSAFE PROOF study at our centre. Three radiologists retrospectively reviewed mpMRI blinded to RP pathology and assigned a Likert score (1-5) for EPE on each side of the prostate. Each scan was also ascribed a Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) score for assessing the quality of the mpMRI scan, where 1 represents the poorest and 5 represents the best diagnostic quality. Outcome measurements and statistical analyses: Diagnostic performance is presented for the binary classification of EPE, including 95% confidence intervals and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A total of 231 lobes from 121 men (mean age 56.9 years) were evaluated. Of these, 39 men (32.2%), or 43 lobes (18.6%), had EPE. A Likert score ≥3 had a sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), NPV, and PPV of 90.4%, 52.3%, 96%, and 29.9%, respectively, and the AUC was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86). The AUC was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.88), 0.78 (0.72-0.84), and 0.92 (0.88-0.96) for biparametric scans, PI-QUAL 1-3, and PI-QUAL 4-5 scans, respectively. Conclusions: MRI can be used effectively by genitourinary radiologists to rule out EPE and help inform surgical planning for men undergoing RARP. EPE prediction was more reliable when the MRI scan was (a) multi-parametric and (b) of a higher image quality according to the PI-QUAL scoring system.",0
622,Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Shells as Enabling Material for Information-Rich Design and Architecture,"The responsive and dynamic character of liquid crystals (LCs), arising from their ability to self-organize into long-range ordered structures while maintaining fluidity, has given them a role as key enabling materials in the information technology that surrounds us today. Ongoing research hints at future LC-based technologies of entirely different types, for instance by taking advantage of the peculiar behavior of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) subject to curvature. Spherical shells of CLC reflect light omnidirectionally with specific polarization and wavelength, tunable from the UV to the infrared (IR) range, with complex patterns arising when many of them are brought together. Here, these properties are analyzed and explained, and future application opportunities from an interdisciplinary standpoint are discussed. By incorporating arrangements of CLC shells in smart facades or vehicle coatings, or in objects of high value subject to counterfeiting, game-changing future uses might arise in fields spanning information security, design, and architecture. The focus here is on the challenges of a digitized and information-rich future society where humans increasingly rely on technology and share their space with autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots.",4
623,Reproducible automated phosphopeptide enrichment using magnetic TiO2 and Ti-IMAC,"Reproducible, comprehensive phosphopeptide enrichment is essential for studying phosphorylation-regulated processes. Here, we describe the application of hyper-porous magnetic TiO2 and Ti-IMAC microspheres for uniform automated phosphopeptide enrichment. Combining magnetic microspheres with a magnetic particle-handling robot enables rapid (45 min), reproducible (r2 ≥ 0.80) and high-fidelity (>90% purity) phosphopeptide purification in a 96-well format. Automated phosphopeptide enrichment demonstrates reproducible synthetic phosphopeptide recovery across 2 orders of magnitude, ""well-to-well"" quantitative reproducibility indistinguishable to internal SILAC standards, and robust ""plate-to-plate"" reproducibility across 5 days of independent enrichments. As a result, automated phosphopeptide enrichment enables statistical analysis of label-free phosphoproteomic samples in a high-throughput manner. This technique uses commercially available, off-the-shelf components and can be easily adopted by any laboratory interested in phosphoproteomic analysis. We provide a free downloadable automated phosphopeptide enrichment program to facilitate uniform interlaboratory collaboration and exchange of phosphoproteomic data sets.",0
624,Actuation Timing Perception of a Powered Ankle Exoskeleton and Its Associated Ankle Angle Changes During Walking,"Robotic ankle exoskeletons have the potential to extend human ability, and actuation timing serves as one of the critical parameters in its controller design. While many experiments have investigated the optimal actuation timing values to achieve different objective functions (e.g. minimizing metabolic cost), studies on users' perception of control parameters are gaining interest as it gives information on people's comfort, coordination, and trust in using devices, as well as providing foundations on how the sensorimotor system detects the exoskeleton behavior changes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate people's sensitivity to changes in exoskeleton actuation timing and its associated exoskeleton ankle angle changes during walking. Participants (n =15) with little or no prior experience with ankle exoskeletons were recruited and performed a psychophysical experiment to characterize their just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds for actuation timing. Participants wore a bilateral active ankle exoskeleton and compared pairs of torque profiles with different actuation timings and low peak torque (0.225 Nm/kg) while walking on the treadmill. The mean timing JND across participants was 2.8±0.6% stride period. Individuals exhibited different sensitivity towards actuation timing, and their associated exoskeleton ankle angle changes also varied. The variance in ankle angle changes might be explained by their differences in ankle stiffness and different ankle torques provided during walking. The results provide insights into how people perceive the changes in exoskeleton control parameters and show individual differences in exoskeleton usage. The actuation timing JND found in this study can also help determine the necessary controller precision.",4
625,Is tumour volume an independent predictor of outcome after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer?,"Background:
        
      
      Preoperative PSA, ISUP grade group (GG), prostate examination and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) form the basis of prostate cancer staging. Unlike other solid organ tumours, tumour volume (TV) is not routinely used aside from crude estimates such as maximum cancer core length. The aim of this study is to assess the role of TV as a marker for oncological outcomes in high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic) radical prostatectomy at a UK centre between 2007 and 2019 were analysed. A total of 251 patients with NCCN high or very high-risk prostate cancer were identified. Primary outcome measure was time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) and the secondary outcome was time to treatment failure (TTF). TV was measured on the pathological specimen using the stacking method. Multivariable cox regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting BCR and TFF. TV as a predictor of BCR and TFF was further analysed through time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to evaluate TV cut-off scores.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Median follow up was 4.50 years. Four factors were associated with BCR and TFF on multivariable analysis (TV, pathological GG, pathological T stage, positive margin >3 mm). Area under the Curve (AUC) for TV as a predictor of BCR and TTF at 5 years was 0.71 and 0.75, respectively. Including all 4 variables in the model increased AUC to 0.84 and 0.85 for BCR and TFF. A 2.50 cm TV cut off demonstrated a significance difference in time to BCR, p < 0.001.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pathological tumour volume is an independent predictor of oncological outcomes in high risk prostate cancer but does not add significant prognostic value when combined with established variables. However, the option of accurate TV measurement on mpMRI raises the possibility of using TV as useful marker for preoperative risk stratification.",5
626,The value of the follow-through derives from motor learning depending on future actions,"In ball sports, we are taught to follow through, despite the inability of events after contact or release to influence the outcome [1, 2]. Here we show that the specific motor memory active at any given moment critically depends on the movement that will be made in the near future. We demonstrate that associating a different follow-through movement with two motor skills that normally interfere [3-7] allows them to be learned simultaneously, suggesting that distinct future actions activate separate motor memories. This implies that when learning a skill, a variable follow-through would activate multiple motor memories across practice, whereas a consistent follow-through would activate a single motor memory, resulting in faster learning. We confirm this prediction and show that such follow-through effects influence adaptation over time periods associated with real-world skill learning. Overall, our results indicate that movements made in the immediate future influence the current active motor memory. This suggests that there is a critical time period both before [8] and after the current movement that determines motor memory activation and controls learning.",6
627,"How to Cost the Implementation of Major System Change for Economic Evaluations: Case Study Using Reconfigurations of Specialist Cancer Surgery in Part of London, England","Background:
        
      
      Studies have been published regarding the impact of major system change (MSC) on care quality and outcomes, but few evaluate implementation costs or include them in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). This is despite large potential costs of MSC: change planning, purchasing or repurposing assets, and staff time. Implementation costs can influence implementation decisions. We describe our framework and principles for costing MSC implementation and illustrate them using a case study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We outlined MSC implementation stages and identified components, using a framework conceived during our work on MSC in stroke services. We present a case study of MSC of specialist surgery services for prostate, bladder, renal and oesophagogastric cancers, focusing on North Central and North East London and West Essex. Health economists collaborated with qualitative researchers, clinicians and managers, identifying key reconfiguration stages and expenditures. Data sources (n = approximately 100) included meeting minutes, interviews, and business cases. National Health Service (NHS) finance and service managers and clinicians were consulted. Using bottom-up costing, items were identified, and unit costs based on salaries, asset costs and consultancy fees assigned. Itemised costs were adjusted and summed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Cost components included options appraisal, bidding process, external review; stakeholder engagement events; planning/monitoring boards/meetings; and making the change: new assets, facilities, posts. Other considerations included hospital tariff changes; costs to patients; patient population; and lifetime of changes. Using the framework facilitated data identification and collection. The total adjusted implementation cost was estimated at £7.2 million, broken down as replacing robots (£4.0 million), consultancy fees (£1.9 million), staff time costs (£1.1 million) and other costs (£0.2 million).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These principles can be used by funders, service providers and commissioners planning MSC and researchers evaluating MSC. Health economists should be involved early, alongside qualitative and health-service colleagues, as retrospective capture risks information loss. These analyses are challenging; many cost factors are difficult to identify, access and measure, and assumptions regarding lifetime of the changes are important. Including implementation costs in CEA might make MSC appear less cost effective, influencing future decisions. Future work will incorporate this implementation cost into the full CEAs of the London Cancer MSC.

628,Towards an Autonomous Vision-Based Unmanned Aerial System against Wildlife Poachers,"Poaching is an illegal activity that remains out of control in many countries. Based on the 2014 report of the United Nations and Interpol, the illegal trade of global wildlife and natural resources amounts to nearly $ 213 billion every year, which is even helping to fund armed conflicts. Poaching activities around the world are further pushing many animal species on the brink of extinction. Unfortunately, the traditional methods to fight against poachers are not enough, hence the new demands for more efficient approaches. In this context, the use of new technologies on sensors and algorithms, as well as aerial platforms is crucial to face the high increase of poaching activities in the last few years. Our work is focused on the use of vision sensors on UAVs for the detection and tracking of animals and poachers, as well as the use of such sensors to control quadrotors during autonomous vehicle following and autonomous landing.",0
629,Low temperature benefits discussed,"At a recent educational workshop event hosted by Advanced Sterilization Products, expert speakers including Authorising Engineers, and delegates, discussed some of their experiences of low temperature sterilisation of 'hi-tech' medical devices, and highlighted the benefits of a process which allows decontamination of instruments and, for example, parts of robotic surgery systems, that cannot be decontaminated using standard methods. Also examined,and reported on here in an article that first appeared in HEJ's sister publication, The Clinical Services Journal, were some of the disadvantages of low temperature sterilisation, the key considerations and options when choosing such a system, and a focus on how the technology's use had benefited a major London-based NHS Trust.",3
630,Development and Progress in Sensors and Technologies for Human Emotion Recognition,"With the advancement of human-computer interaction, robotics, and especially humanoid robots, there is an increasing trend for human-to-human communications over online platforms (e.g., zoom). This has become more significant in recent years due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. The increased use of online platforms for communication signifies the need to build efficient and more interactive human emotion recognition systems. In a human emotion recognition system, the physiological signals of human beings are collected, analyzed, and processed with the help of dedicated learning techniques and algorithms. With the proliferation of emerging technologies, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT), future Internet, and artificial intelligence, there is a high demand for building scalable, robust, efficient, and trustworthy human recognition systems. In this paper, we present the development and progress in sensors and technologies to detect human emotions. We review the state-of-the-art sensors used for human emotion recognition and different types of activity monitoring. We present the design challenges and provide practical references of such human emotion recognition systems in the real world. Finally, we discuss the current trends in applications and explore the future research directions to address issues, e.g., scalability, security, trust, privacy, transparency, and decentralization.",4
631,Automated compounding technology and workflow solutions for the preparation of chemotherapy: a systematic review,"Objectives:
        
      
      The current systematic review (SR) was undertaken to summarise the published literature reporting the clinical and economic value of automation for chemotherapy preparation management to include compounding workflow software and robotic compounding systems.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library on 16 November 2017 to identify publications investigating chemotherapy compounding workflow software solutions used in a hospital pharmacy for the preparation of chemotherapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      5175 publications were screened by title and abstract and 18 of 72 full publications screened were included. Grey literature searching identified an additional seven publications. The SR identified 25 publications relating to commercial technologies for compounding (Robotic compounding systems: APOTECAchemo (n=12), CytoCare (n=5) and RIVA (n=1); Workflow software: Cato (n=6) and Diana (n=1)). The studies demonstrate that compounding technologies improved accuracy in dose preparations and reduced dose errors compared with manual compounding. Comparable levels of contamination were reported for technologies compared with manual compounding. The compounding technologies were associated with reductions in annual costs compared with manual compounding, but the impact on compounding times was not consistent and was dependent on the type of compounding technology.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The published evidence suggests that the implementation of chemotherapy compounding automation solutions may reduce compounding errors and reduce costs; however, this is highly variable depending on the form of automation. In addition, the available evidence is heterogeneous, sparse and inconsistently reported. A key finding from the current SR is a 'call to action' to encourage pharmacists to publish data following implementation of chemotherapy compounding technologies in their hospital, which would allow for evidence-based recommendations on the benefits of chemotherapy compounding technologies.",5
632,Robotic-assisted laparoscopic colposuspension for female stress urinary incontinence: a prospective series,"The suspension of use of sub-urethral mesh in the UK in 2018 has seen the resurgence of colposuspension in female SUI surgery. Open and laparoscopic colposuspension techniques are well recognised. We present data from 28 robotic-assisted laparoscopic colposuspension (RALCp) procedures, reporting on technique, safety and efficacy. Approval was obtained from the hospital New and Novel Procedures Committee. All patients had urodynamic assessment prior to surgery. Data was prospectively gathered and 24-h pad usage and Urinary Incontinence Short Form Questionnaire (ICIQ-UI-SF) scores were used to assess symptom severity and quality of life. PGII scores were used to assess patient satisfaction after the procedure. Paired T test analysis was conducted. Since May 2019, robotic colposuspension has been performed in 28 patients. The mean age and BMI were 49 and 27 (kg/m2), respectively, with a mean follow-up period of 12 months. 67.9% of patients had pure urodynamic SUI and 32.1% of patients had previous anti-SUI surgery. Average operating time was 127 min, blood loss 20 ml and length of stay 2 days. There was a significant 73% improvement in mean 24-h pad usage (p = 0.001) and an improvement in mean ICIQ-UI-SF scores from 18.1 to 9.4 (p = 0.0001). Day 1 mean pain score was 5/10. This is the largest series of its kind. Robotic colposuspension is safe and feasible with significant improvements seen in quality of life scores and number of pads used per day. It presents a minimally invasive treatment option in female SUI, however needs larger volume evaluation and longer follow-up for further evaluation.",2
633,"Early Experience of Undertaking Robotic Assisted Total Mesorectal Excision in Rectal Resections, Avoiding a Diverting Stoma: Key eHancement of the Anastomosis for No Stoma Technique - A Case Series","Background. Anastomotic leak is a feared complication in rectal cancer surgery, and a proximal diverting stoma to protect the rectal anastomosis is used to minimize its impact. We evaluated a novel technique that uses the da Vinci® robotic platform (Intuitive Surgical) to reinforce the colorectal anastomosis and rectal staple line with sutures, and rectal resection and assessment of the anastomotic perfusion, using our Portsmouth protocol. Methods. During robotic rectal cancer surgery, we used indocyanine green to determine the level of transection and check the vascularity of the circular anastomosis. The distal transverse staple line and circular staple line of the colorectal anastomosis were reinforced with absorbable interrupted stitches (KHANS technique - Key enHancement of the Anastomosis for No Stoma). The integrity of the colorectal/anal anastomosis was also checked using the underwater air-water leak test, with concomitant flexible sigmoidoscopy to visualize the circular staple line. Results. Fifty patients underwent total mesorectal excision for cancer. Using the KHANS technique, we avoided a diverting stoma in all cases. One patient had a radiological leak, leading to a pelvic abscess. In 56% of cases, the anastomosis was within 5 cm of the anal verge. Median length of stay was 5 (3-34) days, with two 30-day readmissions. No 90-day mortality or 30-day reoperations were observed. Conclusion. The KHANS technique appears feasible, successful, and safe in decreasing the incidence of diverting stomas in rectal resections.",9
634,Comparison Between Robotic and Laparoscopic or Open Anastomoses: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic surgery has been increasingly used in fashioning various surgical anastomoses. Our aim was to collect and analyze outcomes related to anastomoses performed using a robotic approach and compare them with those done using laparoscopic or open approaches through meta-analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic review was conducted for articles comparing robotic with laparoscopic and/or open operations (colectomy, low anterior resection, gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), pancreaticoduodenectomy, radical cystectomy, pyeloplasty, radical prostatectomy, renal transplant) published up to June 2019 searching Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinical Trials and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies containing information about outcomes related to hand-sewn anastomoses were included for meta-analysis. Studies with stapled anastomoses or without relevant information about the anastomotic technique were excluded. We also excluded studies in which the anastomoses were performed extracorporeally in laparoscopic or robotic operations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 83 studies referring to the aforementioned operations (4 randomized controlled and 79 non-randomized, 10 prospective and 69 retrospective) apart from colectomy and low anterior resection. Anastomoses done using robotic instruments provided similar results to those done using laparoscopic or open approach in regards to anastomotic leak or stricture. However, there were lower rates of stenosis in robotic than in laparoscopic RYGB (p=0.01) and in robotic than in open radical prostatectomy (p<0.00001). Moreover, all anastomoses needed more time to be performed using the robotic rather than the open approach in renal transplant (p≤0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic anastomoses provide equal outcomes with laparoscopic and open ones in most operations, with a few notable exceptions.",5
635,"Surgical trends, outcomes and disparities in minimal invasive surgery for patients with endometrial cancer in England: a retrospective cohort study","Objective:
        
      
      To examine surgical outcomes and trends in the implementation of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) use for endometrial cancer (EC).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Retrospective cohort study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      English National Health Service hospitals 2011-2017/2018.
    


          Population:
        
      
      35 304 patients having a hysterectomy for EC identified from Hospital Episode Statistics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Univariate and multivariate analyses compared MIS to open hysterectomy (OH) by assessing the association between demographic, clinical and hospital characteristics by using logistic regression. A propensity score was created, to control for confounding factors including demographics, clinical and hospital characteristics, from a logistic regression which enabled the inverse probability weighting of treatment to be applied in order to compare outcomes of treatment.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The association between route of surgery on perioperative morbidity and mortality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The MIS rate rose from 40.3% in 2011 to 68.7% in 2017/2018, however, there was significant geographical variation (p<0.001). The overall 90-day mortality was significantly higher with OH versus MIS (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.62, p=0.0002). MIS rates were significantly lower in patients from the lowest socioeconomic group (LSEG) compared with patients from the highest group (HSEG) (55.4% vs 59.9%, p<0.01), and in the black population as compared with white and Asian populations (40.4% vs 58.6% and 56.0%, p<0.0001). When patients from LSEG and black patients were treated in hospitals with high MIS rates, the MIS rate increased close to that of the HSEG and white patients (81.0% and 74.1% vs 83.2% and 82.6%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Further investigation is needed to understand the barriers to MIS and improve access so that as many patients as possible can benefit from the reduced morbidity/mortality associated with MIS.",3
636,Mapping the Dimensions of Agency,"Neural devices have the capacity to enable users to regain abilities lost due to disease or injury - for instance, a deep brain stimulator (DBS) that allows a person with Parkinson's disease to regain the ability to fluently perform movements or a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that enables a person with spinal cord injury to control a robotic arm. While users recognize and appreciate the technologies' capacity to maintain or restore their capabilities, the neuroethics literature is replete with examples of concerns expressed about agentive capacities: A perceived lack of control over the movement of a robotic arm might result in an altered sense of feeling responsible for that movement. Clinicians or researchers being able to record and access detailed information of a person's brain might raise privacy concerns. A disconnect between previous, current, and future understandings of the self might result in a sense of alienation. The ability to receive and interpret sensory feedback might change whether someone trusts the implanted device or themselves. Inquiries into the nature of these concerns and how to mitigate them has produced scholarship that often emphasizes one issue - responsibility, privacy, authenticity, or trust - selectively. However, we believe that examining these ethical dimensions separately fails to capture a key aspect of the experience of living with a neural device. In exploring their interrelations, we argue that their mutual significance for neuroethical research can be adequately captured if they are described under a unified heading of agency. On these grounds, we propose an ""Agency Map"" which brings together the diverse neuroethical dimensions and their interrelations into a comprehensive framework. With this, we offer a theoretically-grounded approach to understanding how these various dimensions are interwoven in an individual's experience of agency.",4
637,Will artificial intelligence eventually replace psychiatrists?,"The dystopian scenario of an 'artificial intelligence takeover' imagines artificial intelligence (AI) becoming the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, rendering humans redundant. As a society we have become increasingly familiar with AI and robots replacing humans in many tasks, certain jobs and even some areas of medicine, but surely this is not the fate of psychiatry?Here a computational neuroscientist (Janaina Mourão-Miranda) and psychiatrist (Justin Taylor Baker) suggest that psychiatry as a profession is relatively safe, whereas psychiatrists Christian Brown and Giles William Story predict that robots will be taking over the asylum.",4
638,Evolution of surgery for rectal cancer: Transanal total mesorectal excision～new standard or fad?～,"Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision (TaTME) has recently been developed to overcome the difficulties associated with conventional laparoscopic or robotic TME. TaTME has gained popularity and becomes the center of attention among colorectal surgeons globally. The present review aims to update the literature, clarify the current status and perspectives of TaTME. Complete TaTME specimens were obtained in 85-97.1% of the case; the reported circumferential resection margin (CRM) ranged from 1.5% to 8.1%, whereas and distal resection margin (DRM) positive rates ranged from 0% to 3.2%. The conversion rate of TaTME occurred from 0 to 15%, and there was no difference between TaTME and laparoscopic or robotic TME. Intraoperative complications occurred in 5-6% of the case, which compared favorably to laparoscopic TME. The most serious intraoperative complication with this approach was urethral injury, although only small numbers were reported, which was possibly due to under-reporting. Clavien-Dindo I or II postoperative complications occurred in 22-24% of the case, and III or IV in 10-11% of the case, which did not differ between TaTME and laparoscopic or robotic TME. TaTME may be technically easier and more beneficial than laparoscopic, robotic or open TME in male patients with a narrow pelvis; in obese patients with a bulky tumor. At present two randomized controlled trials, COLOR III and GRECCAR, and comparing TaTME with laparoscopic TME are being conducted and their outcomes are awaited. TaTME is a complex procedure, but proved to be feasible, oncologically safe, and effective in difficult cases. Before this new technique is adopted, proper training with Proctor/mentorship is strongly advised. Careful case selection and audit of data are mandatory.",3
639,Human trust in otherware - a systematic literature review bringing all antecedents together,"Technological systems are becoming increasingly smarter, which causes a shift in the way they are seen: from tools used to execute specific tasks to social counterparts with whom to cooperate. To ensure that these interactions are successful, trust has proven to be the most important driver. We conducted an extensive and structured review with the goal to reveal all previously researched antecedents influencing the human trust in technology-based counterparts. In doing so, we synthesised 179 papers and uncovered 479 trust antecedents. We assigned these antecedents to four main groups. Three of them have been explored before: environment, trustee, and trustor. Within this paper, we argue for a fourth group, the interaction. This quadripartition allows the inclusion of antecedents that were not considered previously. Moreover, we critically question the practice of uncovering more and more trust antecedents, which already led to an opaque plethora and thus becomes increasingly complex for practitioners. Practitioner summary: Future designers of intelligent and interactive technology will have to consider trust to a greater extent. We emphasise that there are far more trust antecedents - and interdependencies - to consider than the ethically motivated discussions about ""Trustworthy AI"" suggest. For this purpose, we derived a trust map as a sound basis.",4
640,A Deep-Learning Based Real-Time Prediction of Seated Postural Limits and its Application in Trunk Rehabilitation,"Seated postural limit defines the boundary of a region such that for any excursions made outside this boundary a subject cannot return the trunk to the neutral position without additional external support. The seated postural limits can be used as a reference to provide assistive support to the torso by the Trunk Support Trainer (TruST). However, fixed boundary representations of seated postural limits are inadequate to capture dynamically changing seated postural limits during training. In this study, we propose a conceptual model of dynamic boundary of the trunk center by assigning a vector that tracks the postural-goal direction and trunk movement amplitude during a sitting task. We experimented with 20 healthy subjects. The results support our hypothesis that TruST intervention with an assist-as-needed force controller based on dynamic boundary representation could achieve more significant sitting postural control improvements than a fixed boundary representation. The second contribution of this paper is that we provide an effective approach to embed deep learning into TruST's real-time controller design. We have compiled a 3D trunk movement dataset which is currently the largest in the literature. We designed a loss function capable of solving the gate-controlled regression problem. We have proposed a novel deep-learning roadmap for the exploration study. Following the roadmap, we developed a deep learning architecture, modified the widely used Inception module, and then obtained a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting the dynamic boundary in real-time. We believe that this approach can be extended to other rehabilitation robots towards designing intelligent dynamic boundary-based assist-as-needed controllers.",4
641,Designing a conversational agent to promote teamwork and collaborative practices using design thinking: An explorative study on user experiences,"Appearance, voice features, and communication style affect users trust in conversational agents (chatbots), but few studies have assessed what features users like and dislike. Using design thinking, we developed Susa, a conversational agent, to help workplaces promote teamwork and collaborative practices. Design thinking prioritizes co-creation and multidisciplinary teamwork to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore users' interactions with and reactions toward Susa and explain how we used user inputs to adapt and refine the first prototype. The employees and managers from four workplaces participated in three workshops to test and refine the agent. We applied an explorative thematic analysis of data collected via video recordings of the workshops. The results of the analyses revealed that visual identity, communication style and personality was important for acceptability. Users favored a more human like agent that primarily communicated with the team via text messages. Users disliked emoticons and humor because these features clashed with the seriousness of the topic. Finally, users highlighted that Susa helped structure organizational change processes, develop concrete action plans, and stay on track. It is a weakness that Susa is a simple robot based on a preprogrammed script that does not allow users to adapt the process.",4
642,A Smart Haptic Hand-Held Device for Neurosurgical Microdissection,"Microneurosurgery requires dexterity, precision and delicate force application in order to be carried out safely and effectively. Neurosurgeons must apply sufficient force in order to carry out microsurgical procedures effectively but not excessive force such that iatrogenic injury occurs. This paper presents a smart hand-held microsurgical instrument that indicates to the surgeon when a force-threshold has been exceeded by providing vibrotactile feedback. Many existing haptic-feedback systems, particularly master-slave robotic platforms, are large, highly complex, and costly. By comparison, the proposed device is compact, fail-safe and low cost. Two psychophysical user studies were carried out to assess the proposed vibrotactile force-threshold feedback system. A cadaveric pilot study was carried out to evaluate the device in a microdissection task. In all the studies performed, the haptic dissector device has shown to be effective in providing real-time feedback in terms of force application during microsurgical tasks.",6
643,"Power-Tool Use in Orthopaedic Surgery: Iatrogenic Injury, Its Detection, and Technological Advances: A Systematic Review","Background:
        
      
      Power tools are an integral part of orthopaedic surgery but have the capacity to cause iatrogenic injury. With this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of iatrogenic injury due to the use of power tools in orthopaedic surgery and to discuss the current methods that can be used to reduce injury.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic review of English-language studies related to power tools and iatrogenic injuries using a keyword search in MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Exclusion criteria included injuries related to cast-saw use, temperature-induced damage, and complications not clearly related to power-tool use.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 3,694 abstracts were retrieved, and 88 studies were included in the final analysis. Few studies and individual case reports looked directly at the prevalence of injury due to power tools. These included 2 studies looking at the frequency of vascular injury during femoral fracture fixation (0.49% and 0.2%), 2 studies investigating the frequency of vertebral artery injury during spinal surgery (0.5% and 0.08%), and 4 studies investigating vascular injury during total joint arthroplasty (1 study involving 138 vascular injuries in 124 patients, 2 studies noting 0.13% and 0.1% incidence, and 1 questionnaire sent electronically to surgeons). There are multiple methods for preventing damage during power-tool use. These include the use of robotics and simulation, specific drill settings, and real-time feedback techniques such as spectroscopy and electromyography.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Power tools have the potential to cause iatrogenic injury to surrounding structures during orthopaedic surgery. Fortunately, the published literature suggests that the frequency of iatrogenic injury using orthopaedic power tools is low. There are multiple technologies available to reduce damage using power tools. In high-risk operations, the use of advanced technologies to reduce the chance of iatrogenic injury should be considered.

644,EEG measures of sensorimotor processing and their development are abnormal in children with isolated dystonia and dystonic cerebral palsy,"Dystonia is a disorder of sensorimotor integration associated with abnormal oscillatory activity within the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical networks. Event-related changes in spectral EEG activity reflect cortical processing but are sparsely investigated in relation to sensorimotor processing in dystonia. This study investigates modulation of sensorimotor cortex EEG activity in response to a proprioceptive stimulus in children with dystonia and dystonic cerebral palsy (CP). Proprioceptive stimuli, comprising brief stretches of the wrist flexors, were delivered via a robotic wrist interface to 30 young people with dystonia (20 isolated genetic/idiopathic and 10 dystonic CP) and 22 controls (mean age 12.7 years). Scalp EEG was recorded using the 10-20 international system and the relative change in post-stimulus power with respect to baseline was calculated for the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) frequency bands. A clear developmental profile in event-related spectral changes was seen in controls. Controls showed a prominent early alpha/mu band event-related desynchronisation (ERD) followed by an event-related synchronisation (ERS) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex following movement of either hand. The alpha ERD was significantly smaller in the dystonia groups for both dominant and non-dominant hand movement (ANCOVA across the 3 groups with age as covariate: dominant hand F(2,47) = 4.45 p = 0.017; non-dominant hand F(2,42) = 9.397 p < 0.001. Alpha ERS was significantly smaller in dystonia for the dominant hand (ANCOVA F(2,47) = 7.786 p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in ERD or ERS between genetic/idiopathic dystonia and dystonic CP. CONCLUSION: Modulation of alpha/mu activity by a proprioceptive stimulus is reduced in dystonia, demonstrating a developmental abnormality of sensorimotor processing which is common to isolated genetic/idiopathic and acquired dystonia/dystonic CP.",6
645,A Framework for Successful Adoption of Surgical Innovation,"Background:
        
      
      Innovation Adoption Frameworks are applied in healthcare industry, but surgical innovation does not follow the same models as medical innovation and it is not always adopted fully by members of the team.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this paper is to develop a framework for successful adoption of surgical innovation.
    


          Research design:
        
      
      This paper is inspired by design thinking. Based on a pragmatic research philosophy, a mixed method approach was selected including semi-structured interview and focus groups, following a questionnaire.
    


          Study sample:
        
      
      A sample of five specialists in the field (doctors and managers) were selected for interview. Six focus groups were conducted. On average, five people were involved in each focus groups, 30 participants in total, including consultants, senior and junior ward nurses, health care assistant (HCA), cancer nurse specialist, stoma nurses, theatre senior and junior staff.
    


          Data collection/analysis:
        
      
      Qualitative data was collected and analyzed using Thematic Analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Following a design thinking approach; firstly, an initial Surgical Adoption Model was proposed, based on the existing literature. Then, the challenges, processes and teams involved in Robotic Surgery adoption, an existing surgical innovation in a local NHS hospital, were explored. Five main themes were extracted from interviews and focus groups data - 'Innovation Perception', 'Guilty vs. Undervalued', 'Knowledge is Power', 'Ex-novation' and 'Facilitators and Super-users'. This resulted into the development of an adapted Surgical Innovation Framework.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The Surgical Innovation Framework incorporated the themes extracted from the data. The framework is unique within the field of surgical innovation and is designed with the aim of improving surgical innovation adoption success rate. Future research can trial the framework to evaluate its effectiveness.",3
646,A randomised trial to assess the educational benefit of a smartphone otoscope in undergraduate medical training,"Purpose:
        
      
      Competent otoscopy is a key otolaryngology skill for a broad range of medical careers, yet undergraduate's confidence to perform otoscopy is reported as low. Smartphone otoscopes have been suggested to improve undergraduates learning of normal eardrum anatomy because unlike the traditional otoscope, the learner and educator share the same image. This study aimed to evaluate whether a smartphone otoscope could enhance medical undergraduates recognition of common ear pathology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      52 medical students were randomised into a standard group that used a traditional otoscope and an intervention group that used a smartphone otoscope. Both groups received a short didactic presentation on the recognition of common ear pathologies and were asked to diagnose four simulated pathologies. Both groups received feedback and guidance on how to better visualise the tympanic membrane. Force response items and 5-point Likert scales loaded on an electronic platform recorded their diagnosis and their perceptions towards the otoscope.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The smartphone-group (n = 20) had higher overall rates of correct diagnosis compared to control (n = 22) (84% vs. 39%, p = < 0.001). Only the grommet station did not show a significant improvement between the two groups (100% vs. 91%, p = 0.49). 90% (n = 20) of participants felt the smartphone otoscope was preferential for their learning. The same number expressed that they want to use it in future learning. The remainder were indifferent.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The smartphone otoscope enabled learners to better observe and recognise middle ear pathology. This popular learning tool has the potential to accelerate the learning curve of otoscopy and therefore improve the proficiency of future doctors at recognising middle ear diseases.",1
647,Socializing Sensorimotor Contingencies,"The aim of this review is to highlight the idea of grounding social cognition in sensorimotor interactions shared across agents. We discuss an action-oriented account that emerges from a broader interpretation of the concept of sensorimotor contingencies. We suggest that dynamic informational and sensorimotor coupling across agents can mediate the deployment of action-effect contingencies in social contexts. We propose this concept of socializing sensorimotor contingencies (socSMCs) as a shared framework of analysis for processes within and across brains and bodies, and their physical and social environments. In doing so, we integrate insights from different fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and research on human-robot interaction. We review studies on dynamic embodied interaction and highlight empirical findings that suggest an important role of sensorimotor and informational entrainment in social contexts. Furthermore, we discuss links to closely related concepts, such as enactivism, models of coordination dynamics and others, and clarify differences to approaches that focus on mentalizing and high-level cognitive representations. Moreover, we consider conceptual implications of rethinking cognition as social sensorimotor coupling. The insight that social cognitive phenomena like joint attention, mutual trust or empathy rely heavily on the informational and sensorimotor coupling between agents may provide novel remedies for people with disturbed social cognition and for situations of disturbed social interaction. Furthermore, our proposal has potential applications in the field of human-robot interaction where socSMCs principles might lead to more natural and intuitive interfaces for human users.",4
648,"AN AUDIT TO ASSESS THE TIMINGS OF TTAS AND INPATIENT ORDERS IN PAEDIATRICS; FROM WRITING, TO SCREENING, TO DISPENSING, AND TO LEAVING DISPENSARY","Aim:
        
      
      To assess the time it takes for paediatric TTA and inpatient orders to be dispensed and sent to ward. This is to establish if the Trust is meeting an operational Key Performance Indicator (KPI).
    


          Standards kpis:
        
      
      ▸ 85% of urgent items (TTAs) dispensed within 1 hour.▸ 85% of non-urgent items (most inpatient orders) dispensed within 3 hrs.
    


          Method:
        
      
      To audit the time it takes for TTAs and inpatient orders to be screened, sent to dispensary, labelled, dispensed, checked, and leave dispensary. Data collection took place over 5 days and focused on TTAs and inpatient orders coming from high turnover paediatric wards.Data was collected on: time to verify, time logged into dispensary, time for labelling, time for checking, and time to leave dispensary.
    


          Exclusion criteria:
        
      
      TTAs/ inpatient orders that contain controlled drugs, requires a dosette box, or is ordered out of hours.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TTA results:The time from writing to screening of TTAs averages 1 hour 34 minutes. However, this may be inaccurate as it requires the doctor to select 'sign and send to pharmacy'. If not selected, the clock has started, but the TTA is not visible to pharmacy.It took on average 2 hrs for all items from being logged in to being checked (n=12). The standard is 1 hour. The rate limiting steps were time to screen and time to label (each of which took approx. 1 hour 30 mins).The majority of the dispensing time is spent labelling, with an average time from logging in to labelling being 1 hour 25 minutes. The dispensing and checking was quick with an average of 36 minutes.
    


          Inpatient results:
        
      
      Inpatient orders took on average 5 hrs 51 minutes for the items to leave dispensary after they had been logged in (n=22). The standard for non-urgent work is 3 hrs.Time to screen was not recorded as the doctors do not record the time of prescribing on the inpatient drug chart. There is only a 6 minute delay between faxing orders and it being logged in, therefore no problem identified at that stage.The majority of time was spent labelling, with an average time from logging in to labelling being 1 hour 56 minutes.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Standards are not being met. The rate limiting steps appears to be labelling in dispensary.
    


          Proposals:
        
      
      ▸ Additional staff labelling at peak times▸ Slow dispensing system, liaise with IT to see if improvements can be made▸ Unable to have more labelling terminals as the robot only has three shoots▸ Induction teaching to include importance of sending TTAs to pharmacy after writing▸ Re-audit in 3 months
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Lack of dataThe screening time for TTAs is misleading as it captures the time from writing (rather than time of sending to pharmacy), until the time screened.No data on time taken for items to arrive back onto the ward, or if medicines collected or delivered by porter.",8
649,SID-2 negatively regulates development likely independent of nutritional dsRNA uptake,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene regulatory mechanism based on RNA-RNA interaction conserved through eukaryotes. Surprisingly, many animals can take-up human-made double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from the environment to initiate RNAi suggesting a mechanism for dsRNA-based information exchange between organisms and their environment. However, no naturally occurring example has been identified since the discovery of the phenomenon 22 years ago. Therefore it remains enigmatic why animals are able to take up dsRNA. Here, we explore other possible functions by performing phenotypic studies of dsRNA uptake deficient sid-2 mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that SID-2 does not have a nutritional role in feeding experiments using genetic sensitized mutants. Furthermore, we use robot assisted imaging to show that sid-2 mutants accelerate growth rate and, by maternal contribution, body length at hatching. Finally, we perform transcriptome and lipidome analysis showing that sid-2 has no effect on energy storage lipids, but affects signalling lipids and the embryo transcriptome. Overall, these results suggest that sid-2 has mild effects on development and is unlikely functioning in the nutritional uptake of dsRNA. These findings broaden our understanding of the biological role of SID-2 and motivate studies identifying the role of environmental dsRNA uptake.",6
650,Learning offline: memory replay in biological and artificial reinforcement learning,"Learning to act in an environment to maximise rewards is among the brain's key functions. This process has often been conceptualised within the framework of reinforcement learning, which has also gained prominence in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) as a way to optimise decision making. A common aspect of both biological and machine reinforcement learning is the reactivation of previously experienced episodes, referred to as replay. Replay is important for memory consolidation in biological neural networks and is key to stabilising learning in deep neural networks. Here, we review recent developments concerning the functional roles of replay in the fields of neuroscience and AI. Complementary progress suggests how replay might support learning processes, including generalisation and continual learning, affording opportunities to transfer knowledge across the two fields to advance the understanding of biological and artificial learning and memory.",4
651,Motor memories in manipulation tasks are linked to contact goals between objects,"Skillful manipulation requires forming memories of object dynamics, linking applied force to motion. Although it has been assumed that such memories are linked to objects, a recent study showed that people can form separate memories when these are linked to different controlled points on an object (Heald JB, Ingram JN, Flanagan JR, Wolpert DM. Nat Hum Behav 2: 300-311, 2018). In that study, participants controlled the handle of a robotic device to move a virtual bar with circles (control points) on the left and right sides. Participants were instructed to move either the left or right control point to a target on the left or right, respectively, such that the required movement was constant. When these control points were paired with opposing force fields, adaptation was observed. In this previous study, both the controlled point and the target changed between contexts. To assess which of these factors is critical for learning, here, we used a similar paradigm but with a bar that automatically rotated as it was moved. In the first experiment, the bar rotated, such that the left and right control points moved to a common target. In the second experiment, the bar rotated such that a single control point moved to a target located on either the left or right. In both experiments, participants were able to learn opposing force fields applied in the two contexts. We conclude that separate memories of dynamics can be formed for different ""contact goals,"" involving a unique combination of the controlled point on an object and the target location this point ""contacts.""NEW & NOTEWORTHY Skilled manipulation requires forming memories of object dynamics, previously assumed to be associated with entire objects. However, we recently demonstrated that people can form multiple motor memories when explicitly instructed to move different locations on an object to different targets. Here, we show that separate motor memories can be learned for different contact goals, which involve a unique combination of a control point and target.",7
652,Imaging modalities aiding nerve-sparing during radical prostatectomy,"Nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy has decreased the post-surgical complications of prostate surgery, but has not eliminated it. The ability to view the microstructure will enable better surgical decisions and lead to better post-surgical outcomes. An ideal imaging modality should provide rapid image acquisition, be low cost, and be specific to the tissue being examined. This article aims to review the current literature to compare three main techniques: multiphoton microscopy (MPM), optical coherence tomography, and confocal microscopy, to see which of these techniques may be best applied in surgical procedures in the future. Embase and Medline were used as the primary databases. Combinations of various key words were used while researching the literature. These included: ""Radical prostatectomy,"" ""nerve-sparing,"" ""nerve mapping,"" ""multiphoton microscopy,"" ""Confocal microscopy,"" and ""Optical Coherence Tomography."" Thereafter, the relevant results were selected and used in the review. Although optical coherence tomography is a low cost and compact modality, it lacks cellular resolution, while confocal microscopy offers great cellular resolution but lacks depth. MPM, on the other hand, provides sufficient depth and produces high-resolution images. The limitation of MPM is its lack of portability, however the advent of dual-modality MPM may be a way forward.",1
653,An ergonomic handheld ultrasound probe providing contact forces and pose information,"This paper presents a handheld ultrasound probe which is integrated with sensors to measure force and pose (position/orientation) information. Using an integrated probe like this, one can relate ultrasound images to spatial location and create 3D ultrasound maps. The handheld device can be used by sonographers and also easily be integrated with robot arms for automated sonography. The handheld device is ergonomically designed; rapid attachment and removal of the ultrasound transducer itself is possible using easy-to-operate clip mechanisms. A cable locking mechanism reduces the impact that gravitational and other external forces have (originating from data and power supply cables connected to the probe) on our measurements. Gravitational errors introduced by the housing of the probe are compensated for using knowledge of the housing geometry and the integrated pose sensor that provides us with accurate orientation information. In this paper, we describe the handheld probe with its integrated force/pose sensors and our approach to gravity compensation. We carried out a set of experiments to verify the feasibility of our approach to obtain accurate spatial information of the handheld probe.",0
654,Impact of Scala Tympani Geometry on Insertion Forces during Implantation,"(1) Background: During a cochlear implant insertion, the mechanical trauma can cause residual hearing loss in up to half of implantations. The forces on the cochlea during the insertion can lead to this mechanical trauma but can be highly variable between subjects which is thought to be due to differing anatomy, namely of the scala tympani. This study presents a systematic investigation of the influence of different geometrical parameters of the scala tympani on the cochlear implant insertion force. The influence of these parameters on the insertion forces were determined by testing the forces within 3D-printed, optically transparent models of the scala tympani with geometric alterations. (2) Methods: Three-dimensional segmentations of the cochlea were characterised using a custom MATLAB script which parametrised the scala tympani model, procedurally altered the key shape parameters (e.g., the volume, vertical trajectory, curvature, and cross-sectional area), and generated 3D printable models that were printed using a digital light processing 3D printer. The printed models were then attached to a custom insertion setup that measured the insertion forces on the cochlear implant and the scala tympani model during a controlled robotic insertion. (3) Results: It was determined that the insertion force is largely unaffected by the overall size, curvature, vertical trajectory, and cross-sectional area once the forces were normalised to an angular insertion depth. A Capstan-based model of the CI insertion forces was developed and matched well to the data acquired. (4) Conclusion: By using accurate 3D-printed models of the scala tympani with geometrical alterations, it was possible to demonstrate the insensitivity of the insertion forces to the size and shape of the scala tympani, after controlling for the angular insertion depth. This supports the Capstan model of the cochlear implant insertion force which predicts an exponential growth of the frictional force with an angular insertion depth. This concludes that the angular insertion depth, rather than the length of the CI inserted, should be the major consideration when evaluating the insertion force and associated mechanical trauma caused by cochlear implant insertion.",0
655,Is transoral robotic surgery a safe and effective multilevel treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea in obese patients following failure of conventional treatment(s)?,"A best evidence topic was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) is a safe and effective multilevel treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in obese patients following failure of conventional treatment(s). A total of 39 papers were identified using the reported searches of which 5 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. Existing treatments for OSA - primarily CPAP - though highly effective are poorly tolerated resulting in an adherence often lower than 50%. As such, surgery is regaining momentum, especially in those patients failing non-surgical treatment (CPAP or oral appliances). TORS represents the latest addition to the armamentarium of Otorhinolaryngologists - Head and Neck Surgeons for the management of OSA. The superior visualisation and ergonomics render TORS ideal for the multilevel treatment of OSA. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for TORS and its suitability is questionable in obese patients. In view of the global obesity pandemic, this is an important question that requires addressing promptly. Despite the drop in success rates with increasing BMI, the success rate of TORS in non-morbidly obese patients (BMI = 30-35kgm-2) exceeds 50%. A 50% success rate may at first seem low, but it is important to realize that this is a patient cohort suffering from a life-threatening disease and no option left other than a tracheostomy. As such, TORS represents an important treatment in non-morbidly obese OSA patients following failure of conventional treatment(s).",1
656,Authentic Boundary Proximal Policy Optimization,"In recent years, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm has received considerable attention because of its excellent performance in many challenging tasks. However, there is still a large space for theoretical explanation of the mechanism of PPO's horizontal clipping operation, which is a key means to improve the performance of PPO. In addition, while PPO is inspired by the learning theory of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), the theoretical connection between PPO's clipping operation and TRPO's trust region constraint has not been well studied. In this article, we first analyze the effect of PPO's clipping operation on the objective function of conservative policy iteration, and strictly give the theoretical relationship between PPO and TRPO. Then, a novel first-order policy gradient algorithm called authentic boundary PPO (ABPPO) is proposed, which is based on the authentic boundary setting rule. To ensure the difference between the new and old policies is better kept within the clipping range, by borrowing the idea of ABPPO, we proposed two novel improved PPO algorithms called rollback mechanism-based ABPPO (RMABPPO) and penalized point policy difference-based ABPPO (P3DABPPO), which are based on the ideas of rollback clipping and penalized point policy difference, respectively. Experiments on the continuous robotic control tasks implemented in MuJoCo show that our proposed improved PPO algorithms can effectively improve the learning stability and accelerate the learning speed compared with the original PPO.",0
657,Transforming healthcare through a digital revolution: A review of digital healthcare technologies and solutions,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on the entire global healthcare infrastructure. The pandemic has necessitated the re-invention, re-organization, and transformation of the healthcare system. The resurgence of new COVID-19 virus variants in several countries and the infection of a larger group of communities necessitate a rapid strategic shift. Governments, non-profit, and other healthcare organizations have all proposed various digital solutions. It's not clear whether these digital solutions are adaptable, functional, effective, or reliable. With the disease becoming more and more prevalent, many countries are looking for assistance and implementation of digital technologies to combat COVID-19. Digital health technologies for COVID-19 pandemic management, surveillance, contact tracing, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention will be discussed in this paper to ensure that healthcare is delivered effectively. Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, telemedicine, robotic solutions, Internet of Things (IoT), digital platforms for communication (DC), computer vision, computer audition (CA), digital data management solutions (blockchain), digital imaging are premiering to assist healthcare workers (HCW's) with solutions that include case base surveillance, information dissemination, disinfection, and remote consultations, along with many other such interventions.",0
658,Ligamentous and capsular restraints to anterior-posterior and superior-inferior laxity of the acromioclavicular joint: a biomechanical study,"Background:
        
      
      Approximately 9% of shoulder girdle injuries involve the acromioclavicular joint (ACJ). There is no clear gold standard or consensus on surgical management of these injuries, in part perpetuated by our incomplete understanding of native ACJ biomechanics. We have therefore conducted a biomechanical study to assess the stabilizing structures of the ACJ in superior-inferior (SI) translation and anterior-posterior (AP) translation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty fresh frozen cadaveric specimens were prepared and mounted onto a robotic arm. The intact native joint was tested in SI translation and AP translation under a 50-N displacing force. Each specimen was retested after sectioning of its stabilizing structures in the following order: investing fascia, ACJ capsular ligaments, trapezoid ligament, and conoid ligament. Their contributions to resisting ACJ displacements were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the intact native ACJ, mean anterior displacement of the clavicle was 7.9 ± 4.3 mm, mean posterior displacement was 7.2 ± 2.6 mm, mean superior displacement was 5.8 ± 3.0 mm, and mean inferior displacement was 3.6 ± 2.6 mm. The conoid ligament was the primary stabilizer of superior displacement (45.6%). The ACJ capsular ligament was the primary stabilizer of inferior displacement (33.8%). The capsular ligament and conoid ligament contributed equally to anterior stability, with rates of 23% and 25.2%, respectively. The capsular ligament was the primary contributor to posterior stability (38.4%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The conoid ligament is the primary stabilizer of superior displacement of the clavicle at the ACJ and contributes significantly to AP stability. Consideration should be given to reconstruction of the ACJ capsular ligament for complete AP stability in high-grade and horizontally unstable ACJ injuries.",8
659,Trust and Cooperation,"We AI researchers are concerned about the potential impact of artificially intelligent systems on humanity. In the first half of this essay, I argue that ethics is an evolved body of cultural knowledge that (among other things) encourages individual behavior that promotes the welfare of the society (which in turn promotes the welfare of its individual members). The causal paths involved suggest that trust and cooperation play key roles in this process. In the second half of the essay, I consider whether the key role of trust exposes our society to existential threats. This possibility arises because decision-making agents (humans, AIs, and others) necessarily rely on simplified models to cope with the unbounded complexity of our physical and social world. By selecting actions to maximize a utility measure, a well-formulated game theory model can be a powerful and valuable tool. However, a poorly-formulated game theory model may be uniquely harmful, in cases where the action it recommends deliberately exploits the vulnerability and violates the trust of cooperative partners. Widespread use of such models can erode the overall levels of trust in the society. Cooperation is reduced, resources are constrained, and there is less ability to meet challenges or take advantage of opportunities. Loss of trust will affect humanity's ability to respond to existential threats such as climate change.",4
660,Effects of an Unexpected and Expected Event on Older Adults' Autonomic Arousal and Eye Fixations During Autonomous Driving,"Driving cessation for some older adults can exacerbate physical, cognitive, and mental health challenges due to loss of independence and social isolation. Fully autonomous vehicles may offer an alternative transport solution, increasing social contact and encouraging independence. However, there are gaps in understanding the impact of older adults' passive role on safe human-vehicle interaction, and on their well-being. 37 older adults (mean age ± SD = 68.35 ± 8.49 years) participated in an experiment where they experienced fully autonomous journeys consisting of a distinct stop (an unexpected event versus an expected event). The autonomous behavior of the vehicle was achieved using the Wizard of Oz approach. Subjective ratings of trust and reliability, and driver state monitoring including visual attention strategies (fixation duration and count) and physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate), were captured during the journeys. Results revealed that subjective trust and reliability ratings were high after journeys for both types of events. During an unexpected stop, overt visual attention was allocated toward the event, whereas during an expected stop, visual attention was directed toward the human-machine interface (HMI) and distributed across the central and peripheral driving environment. Elevated skin conductance level reflecting increased arousal persisted only after the unexpected event. These results suggest that safety-critical events occurring during passive fully automated driving may narrow visual attention and elevate arousal mechanisms. To improve in-vehicle user experience for older adults, a driver state monitoring system could examine such psychophysiological indices to evaluate functional state and well-being. This information could then be used to make informed decisions on vehicle behavior and offer reassurance during elevated arousal during unexpected events.",4
661,Technology-aided assessment of sensorimotor function in early infancy,"There is a pressing need for new techniques capable of providing accurate information about sensorimotor function during the first 2 years of childhood. Here, we review current clinical methods and challenges for assessing motor function in early infancy, and discuss the potential benefits of applying technology-assisted methods. We also describe how the use of these tools with neuroimaging, and in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can shed new light on the intra-cerebral processes underlying neurodevelopmental impairment. This knowledge is of particular relevance in the early infant brain, which has an increased capacity for compensatory neural plasticity. Such tools could bring a wealth of knowledge about the underlying pathophysiological processes of diseases such as cerebral palsy; act as biomarkers to monitor the effects of possible therapeutic interventions; and provide clinicians with much needed early diagnostic information.",0
662,Robotic CME in obese patients: advantage of robotic ultrasound scan for vascular dissection,"Complete mesocolic excision (CME) in right-sided colon cancers appears to confer oncological benefits compared to conventional colectomy. Identification of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) remains challenging. We describe the novel use of intra-operative robotic ultrasound scan (rUSS) in obese patients (BMI ≥ 29). All consecutive patients having robotic CME for colon cancer between 2014 and 2017 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Data were recorded on an ethics approved prospective database and included patient demographics, clinical and oncological outcomes. Patients were divided into group 1 (BMI ≤ 28) and group 2 (BMI ≥ 29). SMV first approach was employed in all cases and SMV detection was aided using rUSS in group 2. Primary outcome was postoperative morbidity. Secondary outcomes included conversion rate, operative time and length of stay (LOS). 41 (group 1, median 66 years) were compared to 32 patients (group 2, median 63 years). There were no conversions to laparoscopy or laparotomy. Median operative times for group 2 were 30 min longer (186 vs. 216 min, p = 0.05). Overall morbidity was similar (20% vs. 19% in group 1 and 2, p = 0.26). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to LOS (median 7 vs. 6 days, p = 0.48), readmissions (2 vs. 5, p = 0.13), R0 resection rate (98% vs. 94%, p = 0.43) and lymph node harvest (median 31 vs. 30, p = 0.28).CME can be technically more challenging than conventional colectomy in obese patients and is associated with longer operative times. The use of rUSS in obese patients can help to identify SMV and allow safer dissection.",9

664,Visual Robot Relocalization Based on Multi-Task CNN and Image-Similarity Strategy,"The traditional CNN for 6D robot relocalization which outputs pose estimations does not interpret whether the model is making sensible predictions or just guessing at random. We found that convnet representations trained on classification problems generalize well to other tasks. Thus, we propose a multi-task CNN for robot relocalization, which can simultaneously perform pose regression and scene recognition. Scene recognition determines whether the input image belongs to the current scene in which the robot is located, not only reducing the error of relocalization but also making us understand with what confidence we can trust the prediction. Meanwhile, we found that when there is a large visual difference between testing images and training images, the pose precision becomes low. Based on this, we present the dual-level image-similarity strategy (DLISS), which consists of two levels: initial level and iteration-level. The initial level performs feature vector clustering in the training set and feature vector acquisition in testing images. The iteration level, namely, the PSO-based image-block selection algorithm, can select the testing images which are the most similar to training images based on the initial level, enabling us to gain higher pose accuracy in testing set. Our method considers both the accuracy and the robustness of relocalization, and it can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking at most 27 ms per frame to compute. Finally, we used the Microsoft 7Scenes dataset and the Cambridge Landmarks dataset to evaluate our method. It can obtain approximately 0.33 m and 7.51∘ accuracy on 7Scenes dataset, and get approximately 1.44 m and 4.83∘ accuracy on the Cambridge Landmarks dataset. Compared with PoseNet, our CNN reduced the average positional error by 25% and the average angular error by 27.79% on 7Scenes dataset, and reduced the average positional error by 40% and the average angular error by 28.55% on the Cambridge Landmarks dataset. We show that our multi-task CNN can localize from high-level features and is robust to images which are not in the current scene. Furthermore, we show that our multi-task CNN gets higher accuracy of relocalization by using testing images obtained by DLISS.",0
665,A Meta-Analysis of Factors Influencing the Development of Trust in Automation: Implications for Understanding Autonomy in Future Systems,"Objective:
        
      
      We used meta-analysis to assess research concerning human trust in automation to understand the foundation upon which future autonomous systems can be built.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Trust is increasingly important in the growing need for synergistic human-machine teaming. Thus, we expand on our previous meta-analytic foundation in the field of human-robot interaction to include all of automation interaction.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We used meta-analysis to assess trust in automation. Thirty studies provided 164 pairwise effect sizes, and 16 studies provided 63 correlational effect sizes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The overall effect size of all factors on trust development was ḡ = +0.48, and the correlational effect was [Formula: see text] = +0.34, each of which represented medium effects. Moderator effects were observed for the human-related (ḡ = +0.49; [Formula: see text] = +0.16) and automation-related (ḡ = +0.53; [Formula: see text] = +0.41) factors. Moderator effects specific to environmental factors proved insufficient in number to calculate at this time.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Findings provide a quantitative representation of factors influencing the development of trust in automation as well as identify additional areas of needed empirical research.
    


          Application:
        
      
      This work has important implications to the enhancement of current and future human-automation interaction, especially in high-risk or extreme performance environments.",4
666,Biomechanical comparison of graft structures in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"Purpose:
        
      
      Double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction may offer kinematic restoration superior to anatomic single bundle (SB), but it remains technically challenging. The femoral attachment site has the most effect on ACL graft isometry, so a simplified three-socket (3S) construct which still uses two sockets to cover the femoral ACL attachment is attractive. It was hypothesised that ACL reconstruction using three- and four-socket techniques would more closely restore native knee kinematics compared to anatomic two-socket (SB) surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Nine cadaveric knees were used to evaluate the kinematics of ACL-intact, ACL-deficient, anatomic SB, three-socket, and DB arthroscopic ACL reconstructions. Suspensory fixation was used, and grafts were tensioned to match the anterior draw of the intact knee at 20°. A six-degree-of-freedom robotic system measured knee laxity under 90 N anterior tibial force and rotational laxity under 5 N-m torque. Combined moments were applied to simulate the pivot-shift subluxation: 4 N-m internal rotation and 8 N-m valgus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significant differences between reconstructions were not found during anterior tibial loading, apart from SB being more lax than DB at 60° flexion. All reconstructions produced comparable laxity to the intact state, apart from SB at 60°. Significant differences between reconstructions were not found at any flexion angle during tibial internal/external applied torques. Under combined loading, DB produced significantly less laxity than SB constructs apart from anterior tibial translation at 0° and internal rotation at 45°. 3S and DB were comparable to the native knee throughout.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although 3S restored laxities to a similar extent to DB, significant superiority over SB surgery was not observed. Although statistically significant differences were found between SB and DB surgery during anterior tibial and simulated pivot-shift loading, both remained similar to the native knee. The clinical relevance is that this study did not support an ACL graft construct more complex than an anatomic single bundle.",8
667,"Not All Information Is Equal: Effects of Disclosing Different Types of Likelihood Information on Trust, Compliance and Reliance, and Task Performance in Human-Automation Teaming","Objective:
        
      
      The study examines the effects of disclosing different types of likelihood information on human operators' trust in automation, their compliance and reliance behaviors, and the human-automation team performance.
    


          Background:
        
      
      To facilitate appropriate trust in and dependence on automation, explicitly conveying the likelihood of automation success has been proposed as one solution. Empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the potential benefits of disclosing likelihood information in the form of automation reliability, (un)certainty, and confidence. Yet, results from these studies are rather mixed.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We conducted a human-in-the-loop experiment with 60 participants using a simulated surveillance task. Each participant performed a compensatory tracking task and a threat detection task with the help of an imperfect automated threat detector. Three types of likelihood information were presented: overall likelihood information, predictive values, and hit and correct rejection rates. Participants' trust in automation, compliance and reliance behaviors, and task performance were measured.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Human operators informed of the predictive values or the overall likelihood value, rather than the hit and correct rejection rates, relied on the decision aid more appropriately and obtained higher task scores.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Not all likelihood information is equal in aiding human-automation team performance. Directly presenting the hit and correct rejection rates of an automated decision aid should be avoided.
    


          Application:
        
      
      The findings can be applied to the design of automated decision aids.",4
668,Trends in surgical and ablative treatment of localised renal cell carcinoma: A review of publication trends over 16 years (2000-2015),"Objective: To investigate the bibliometric (publication) trends in surgical and ablative treatment of localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC) over a period of 16-years, from 2000 to 2015, as publication trends reflect clinical practice and new innovations. Material and methods: We performed a systematic review using PubMed over a 16-year period from 2000 to 2015 for all published papers on surgical and ablative management of renal tumours. Data were further analysed in two time periods, period-1 (2000-2007) and period-2 (2008-2015). Results: During the last 16 years a total of 2415 papers were published on surgical (n = 1662, 69%) and ablative (n = 753, 31%) management of RCC. This included partial nephrectomy (PN; n = 1662, 69%), cryoablation (CA; n = 405, 17%), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA; n = 348, 14%). When comparing the two time periods for PN, during period-2, the change was +189% (P < 0.001), +69% (P = 0.004) and +4600% (P < 0.001) for open PN, laparoscopic PN and robotic PN, respectively. Regarding ablative techniques, a change of +109% (P = 0.002) and +78% (P = 0.036) was seen for CA and RFA, respectively. There was also a significant rise in percutaneous CA when compared to laparoscopic CA (P < 0.002). Conclusions: There has been a rise in all forms of PN and ablative techniques over the last 16 years. This rise has been particularly steep for robotic PN potentially reflecting a change in surgical practice.

669,Treatment of multiple intracranial metastases in radiation oncology: a contemporary review of available technologies,"The use of stereotactic radiosurgery to treat multiple intracranial metastases, frequently concurrently, has become increasingly common. The ability to accurately and safely deliver stereotactic radiosurgery treatment to multiple intracranial metastases (MIM) relies heavily on the technology available for targeting, planning, and delivering the dose. A number of platforms are currently marketed for such applications, each with intrinsic capabilities and limitations. These can be broadly categorised as cobalt-based, linac-based, and robotic. This review describes the most common representative technologies for each type along with their advantages and current limitations as they pertain to the treatment of multiple intracranial metastases. Each technology was used to plan five clinical cases selected to represent the clinical breadth of multiple metastases cases. The reviewers discuss the different strengths and limitations attributed to each technology in the case of MIM as well as the impact of disease-specific characteristics (such as total number of intracranial metastases, their size and relative proximity) on plan and treatment quality.",0
670,Separation and parallel sequencing of the genomes and transcriptomes of single cells using G&T-seq,"Parallel sequencing of a single cell's genome and transcriptome provides a powerful tool for dissecting genetic variation and its relationship with gene expression. Here we present a detailed protocol for G&T-seq, a method for separation and parallel sequencing of genomic DNA and full-length polyA(+) mRNA from single cells. We provide step-by-step instructions for the isolation and lysis of single cells; the physical separation of polyA(+) mRNA from genomic DNA using a modified oligo-dT bead capture and the respective whole-transcriptome and whole-genome amplifications; and library preparation and sequence analyses of these amplification products. The method allows the detection of thousands of transcripts in parallel with the genetic variants captured by the DNA-seq data from the same single cell. G&T-seq differs from other currently available methods for parallel DNA and RNA sequencing from single cells, as it involves physical separation of the DNA and RNA and does not require bespoke microfluidics platforms. The process can be implemented manually or through automation. When performed manually, paired genome and transcriptome sequencing libraries from eight single cells can be produced in ∼3 d by researchers experienced in molecular laboratory work. For users with experience in the programming and operation of liquid-handling robots, paired DNA and RNA libraries from 96 single cells can be produced in the same time frame. Sequence analysis and integration of single-cell G&T-seq DNA and RNA data requires a high level of bioinformatics expertise and familiarity with a wide range of informatics tools.",7
671,ScreenGarden: a shinyR application for fast and easy analysis of plate-based high-throughput screens,"Background:
        
      
      Colony growth on solid media is a simple and effective measure for high-throughput genomic experiments such as yeast two-hybrid, synthetic dosage lethality and Synthetic Physical Interaction screens. The development of robotic pinning tools has facilitated the experimental design of these assays, and different imaging software can be used to automatically measure colony sizes on plates. However, comparison to control plates and statistical data analysis is often laborious and pinning issues or plate specific growth effects can lead to the detection of false-positive growth defects.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We have developed ScreenGarden, a shinyR application, to enable easy, quick and robust data analysis of plate-based high throughput assays. The code allows comparisons of different formats of data and different sized arrays of colonies. A comparison of ScreenGarden with previous analysis tools shows that it performs, at least, equivalently. The software can be run either via a website or offline via the RStudio program; the code is available and can be modified by expert uses to customise the analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ScreenGarden provides a simple, fast and effective tool to analyse colony growth data from genomic experiments.",0
672,The first single-incision plus one-port transverse colon resection using Senhance Digital Laparoscopy System: a case report,"Background:
        
      
      We have introduced the Senhance Digital Laparoscopy System and actively use for colorectal cancer surgery. Recently, we also try to perform surgery by reduce port as less invasive method. For the first time, we report a case of single-incision plus one-port transverse colectomy using Senhance system.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      The case was a 57-year-old woman, diagnosed with transverse colon cancer referred to our department. The preoperative diagnosis was cT1bN0M0, Stage I. We performed single-incision plus one-port transverse colon resection using Senhance system without any problems. The operative time was 203 min and the blood loss was 35 ml.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We report the first case of single-incision plus one-port transverse colectomy using Senhance system. We trust this approach will find increasing use, enabling a safer means of minimally invasive robotic surgery.",3
673,Neurologically asymptomatic cerebral oligometastatic prostate carcinoma metastasis identified on [Ga]Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT,"Background:
        
      
      Brain metastases from prostate cancer are rare and usually only occur in the context of widespread systemic disease. This is the first case report of a solitary brain oligometastasis, in a neurologically intact prostate cancer patient with no other systemic disease, detected using [68Ga]Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT and only the second one using a PSMA-based radiopharmaceutical.
    


          Case presentation:
        
      
      We report the case of a prostate cancer patient presenting 5 years after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence, no neurological symptoms, and in the absence of metastatic lesions in the body on conventional imaging. A solitary cerebral metastasis was detected using [68Ga]Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT, surgically resected, leading to a drop in serum PSA and a good recovery.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this case, [68Ga]Ga-THP-PSMA PET/CT resulted in a major change in clinical management and avoided additional morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment. This report demonstrates the importance of considering the presence of metastatic disease outside the conventional locations of prostate cancer spread, as well as the importance of ensuring comprehensive [68Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT coverage from vertex to upper thighs.",0
674,Using Hidden Markov Models to characterise intermittent social behaviour in fish shoals,"The movement of animals in groups is widespread in nature. Understanding this phenomenon presents an important problem in ecology with many applications that range from conservation to robotics. Underlying all group movements are interactions between individual animals and it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanisms of this social behaviour. To date, despite promising methodological developments, there are few applications to data of practical statistical techniques that inferentially investigate the extent and nature of social interactions in group movement. We address this gap by demonstrating the usefulness of a Hidden Markov Model approach to characterise individual-level social movement in published trajectory data on three-spined stickleback shoals (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and novel data on guppy shoals (Poecilia reticulata). With these models, we formally test for speed-mediated social interactions and verify that they are present. We further characterise this inferred social behaviour and find that despite the substantial shoal-level differences in movement dynamics between species, it is qualitatively similar in guppies and sticklebacks. It is intermittent, occurring in varying numbers of individuals at different time points. The speeds of interacting fish follow a bimodal distribution, indicating that they are either stationary or move at a preferred mean speed, and social fish with more social neighbours move at higher speeds, on average. Our findings and methodology present steps towards characterising social behaviour in animal groups.",4
675,Changing paradigms in the treatment of residual/recurrent head and neck cancer: implications for dysphagia management,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Despite advances in head and neck cancer treatment provision, recurrence rates remain high with the added risk of successfully treated patients developing a second primary. We report on the management of dysphagia in the context of residual/recurrent or new disease in a preirradiated field and make suggestions for future research.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      There have been numerous developments in treatment options for people with residual/recurrent head and neck cancer. This is because of improved surgical interventions including microvascular reconstruction techniques and transoral robotic surgery. In the era of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), there may be opportunities for re-irradiation. These advancements are now increasingly employed in the context of locoregionally recurrent disease. With results being reported from an increasing number of clinical trials, systemic therapies, including treatment with immunotherapy, offer the potential for increased survival with less treatment-related toxicity.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Dysphagia is recognized as a significant toxicity following radical surgical and radiation-based approaches, particularly when multimodal treatment is required. Increasingly, late radiation-associated dysphagia is gaining greater attention in the literature. Many patients presenting with residual and recurrent disease do so against a background of comorbidities as well as persistent and late treatment-related toxicity.",0
676,Perspectives on Open Science and The Future of Scholarly Communication: Internet Trackers and Algorithmic Persuasion,"The current digital content industry is heavily oriented towards building platforms that track users' behaviour and seek to convince them to stay longer and come back sooner onto the platform. Similarly, authors are incentivised to publish more and to become champions of dissemination. Arguably, these incentive systems are built around public reputation supported by a system of metrics, hard to be assessed. Generally, the digital content industry is permeable to non-human contributors (algorithms that are able to generate content and reactions), anonymity and identity fraud. It is pertinent to present a perspective paper about early signs of track and persuasion in scholarly communication. Building our views, we have run a pilot study to determine the opportunity for conducting research about the use of ""track and persuade"" technologies in scholarly communication. We collected observations on a sample of 148 relevant websites and we interviewed 15 that are experts related to the field. Through this work, we tried to identify 1) the essential questions that could inspire proper research, 2) good practices to be recommended for future research, and 3) whether citizen science is a suitable approach to further research in this field. The findings could contribute to determining a broader solution for building trust and infrastructure in scholarly communication. The principles of Open Science will be used as a framework to see if they offer insights into this work going forward.",4
677,Urologic Cancers [Internet],"Urologic cancers are an umbrella term for cancers of the prostate, kidney, bladder, penis, and testis. Routine use of advanced imaging modalities for various reasons has increased the incidental detection of some of these cancers at an early stage. Robot-assisted surgery for nephrectomy, prostatectomy, cystectomy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has improved surgical outcomes of localized disease. The introduction of targeted therapies since 2006 has revolutionized the management of metastatic kidney cancer. Despite these advances, the five-year survival of patients with advanced renal cancer is still poor and we need a better understanding of the disease. The book Urologic Cancers brings together an international team of clinicians and basic scientists to provide an up-to-date overview of a wide spectrum of topics that comprise epidemiological, pathological, clinical, and biological aspects of urologic cancers. From the epidemiological spectrum, the most recent information on the epidemiology of testicular cancer and penile cancer are presented. From the clinical spectrum, the characteristics and management of divergent urothelial neoplasms, the role of surgery in the management of testicular and kidney cancer, biopsy approaches for better detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer, the role of family history and germline genetics in prostate cancer disease profiling and screening, and the need for the implementation of quality assurance programs to improve prostate cancer care discussed. The biological aspects of disease mechanisms focus on various emerging molecular pathways and how these can be targeted to develop novel therapeutics. The contents of the book will be of interest to healthcare professionals, basic scientists and clinicians interested in urologic cancers.",0
678,"Inferring Trust From Users' Behaviours; Agents' Predictability Positively Affects Trust, Task Performance and Cognitive Load in Human-Agent Real-Time Collaboration","Collaborative virtual agents help human operators to perform tasks in real-time. For this collaboration to be effective, human operators must appropriately trust the agent(s) they are interacting with. Multiple factors influence trust, such as the context of interaction, prior experiences with automated systems and the quality of the help offered by agents in terms of its transparency and performance. Most of the literature on trust in automation identified the performance of the agent as a key factor influencing trust. However, other work has shown that the behavior of the agent, type of the agent's errors, and predictability of the agent's actions can influence the likelihood of the user's reliance on the agent and efficiency of tasks completion. Our work focuses on how agents' predictability affects cognitive load, performance and users' trust in a real-time human-agent collaborative task. We used an interactive aiming task where participants had to collaborate with different agents that varied in terms of their predictability and performance. This setup uses behavioral information (such as task performance and reliance on the agent) as well as standardized survey instruments to estimate participants' reported trust in the agent, cognitive load and perception of task difficulty. Thirty participants took part in our lab-based study. Our results showed that agents with more predictable behaviors have a more positive impact on task performance, reliance and trust while reducing cognitive workload. In addition, we investigated the human-agent trust relationship by creating models that could predict participants' trust ratings using interaction data. We found that we could reliably estimate participants' reported trust in the agents using information related to performance, task difficulty and reliance. This study provides insights on behavioral factors that are the most meaningful to anticipate complacent or distrusting attitudes toward automation. With this work, we seek to pave the way for the development of trust-aware agents capable of responding more appropriately to users by being able to monitor components of the human-agent relationships that are the most salient for trust calibration.",4
679,Changes in UK renal oncological surgical practice from 2008 to 2017: implications for cancer service provision and surgical training,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine and analyse the temporal changes in oncological nephrectomy practice and training opportunities using data obtained from the UK British Association of Urological Surgeons nephrectomy register from 2008 to 2017.
    


          Patient and methods:
        
      
      All nephrectomies within the dataset for this time period were analysed (n = 54 251). Cases were divided into radical nephrectomy (RN), partial nephrectomy (PN) and nephroureterectomy (NU). Simple nephrectomy, donor nephrectomy and benign PN were excluded. The annual frequencies for each oncological nephrectomy method, surgical approach, grade of surgeon, hospital caseload numbers and short-term surgical outcomes were determined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Reported annual nephrectomy numbers increased by 2.5-fold in the 9-year time period. The number of hospitals performing nephrectomies decreased by 22%, however, more than 40% of centres performed more than 70 cases a year. There was a trend towards a decrease in overall length of hospital stay (9 vs 5 days; P < 0.01) and decreased transfusion rates. The proportion of minimally invasive procedures increased from 57% to 75%, with nephron-sparing rates increasing from 8.9% overall to 24.8%. With regard to surgical technique, robot-assisted surgery saw a mean annual increase of 222%. Overall, there was a 10% decrease in the proportion of PNs performed by trainee surgeons.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Renal surgery has changed considerably with regard to volume and also surgical approach, with rates of nephron-sparing surgery and minimally invasive surgery significantly increasing. Increasing hospital centralization and institutional experience, and a shift to robot-assisted surgery appear to have contributed to the observed improved patient outcomes. The increasing utilization of robot-assisted surgery has potential implications and challenges for the training of future urology surgeons.",3
680,Trustworthy human-AI partnerships,"In this paper, we foreground some of the key research challenges that arise in the design of trustworthy human-AI partnerships. In particular, we focus on the challenges in designing human-AI partnerships that need to be addressed to help humans and organizations trust their machine counterparts individually or as a collective (e.g., as robot teams or groups of software agents). We also aim to identify the risks associated with human-AI partnerships and therefore determine the associated measures to mitigate these risks. By so doing, we will trigger new avenues of research that will address the key barriers to the adoption of AI-based systems more widely in our daily lives and in industry.",4

682,An Unusual and Rare Metachronous Ipsilateral Ureteric Stump Metastasis Post Radical Nephrectomy,"We report a case of recurrence of chromophobe renal cell cancer in the ipsilateral ureteric stump eight years later after the primary tumor was excised successfully. Before this detection of the recurrence, the patient had presented with recurrent episodes of hematuria four years after the radical nephrectomy was performed and the investigations were inconclusive. Eventually, the lesion was detected on flexible cystoscopy in the area of the right ureteric orifice protruding in the bladder. Transurethral resection of the tumor surprisingly revealed a chromophobe renal cancer with similar features seen in the primary tumor specimen. The patient underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic excision of the ureteric stump with a cuff of the bladder and has been recurrence-free for five years on regular surveillance scans.",1
683,How transparency modulates trust in artificial intelligence,"The study of human-machine systems is central to a variety of behavioral and engineering disciplines, including management science, human factors, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have brought the study of human-AI teams into sharper focus. An important set of questions for those designing human-AI interfaces concerns trust, transparency, and error tolerance. Here, we review the emerging literature on this important topic, identify open questions, and discuss some of the pitfalls of human-AI team research. We present opposition (extreme algorithm aversion or distrust) and loafing (extreme automation complacency or bias) as lying at opposite ends of a spectrum, with algorithmic vigilance representing an ideal mid-point. We suggest that, while transparency may be crucial for facilitating appropriate levels of trust in AI and thus for counteracting aversive behaviors and promoting vigilance, transparency should not be conceived solely in terms of the explainability of an algorithm. Dynamic task allocation, as well as the communication of confidence and performance metrics-among other strategies-may ultimately prove more useful to users than explanations from algorithms and significantly more effective in promoting vigilance. We further suggest that, while both aversive and appreciative attitudes are detrimental to optimal human-AI team performance, strategies to curb aversion are likely to be more important in the longer term than those attempting to mitigate appreciation. Our wider aim is to channel disparate efforts in human-AI team research into a common framework and to draw attention to the ecological validity of results in this field.",4
684,Algebraic Connectivity Control in Distributed Networks by Using Multiple Communication Channels,"The effectiveness of collaboration in distributed networks, such as sensor networks and multi-agent systems, relies on nodes' ability to exchange information. The availability of various communication protocols with different technical properties opens the possibility to guarantee connectivity during a system's operation in any condition. A communication network can be represented by a graph on which connectivity can be expressed by a well-known algebraic connectivity value or Fiedler value. It is one of the most important tools used in many applications where connectivity preservation is required. In this paper, a trust-based consensus algorithm for algebraic connectivity estimation has been implemented. To guarantee the accomplishment of the global objective and the system's performance, our contributions include: (i) a novel decentralized framework for combining multiple communication channels in a resulting channel and (ii) a decentralized algebraic connectivity control law that dynamically changes the number of agents in the system during operation. The proposed algebraic connectivity control strategy has been evaluated in simulations and in a real multi-robot system using two channels with different properties and initial topologies.",4
685,Feasibility and usability of a regional hub model for colorectal cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic produced unprecedented challenges, at a global level, in the provision of cancer care. With the ongoing need in the delivery of life-saving cancer treatment, the surgical management of patients with colorectal cancer required prompt significant transformation. The aim of this retrospective study is to report the outcome of a bespoke regional Cancer Hub model in the delivery of elective and essential colorectal cancer surgery, at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 168 patients underwent colorectal cancer surgery from April 1st to June 30th of 2020. Approximately 75% of patients operated upon underwent colonic resection, of which 47% were left-sided, 34% right-sided and 12% beyond total mesorectal excision surgeries. Around 79% of all resectional surgeries were performed via laparotomy, and the remainder 21%, robotically or laparoscopically. Thirty-day complication rate, for Clavien-Dindo IIIA and above, was 4.2%, and 30-day mortality rate was 0.6%. Re-admission rate, within 30 days post-discharge, was 1.8%, however, no patient developed COVID-19 specific complications post-operatively and up to 28 days post-discharge. The established Cancer Hub offered elective surgical care for patients with colorectal cancer in a centralised, timely and efficient manner, with acceptable post-operative outcomes and no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 during their inpatient stay. We offer a practical model of care that can be used when elective surgery ""hubs"" for streamlined delivery of elective care needs to be established in an expeditious fashion, either due to the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future pandemics.",3
686,Blind Evaluation of Hybrid Protein Structure Analysis Methods based on Cross-Linking,"Hybrid methods combine experimental data and computational modeling to analyze protein structures that are elusive to structure determination. To spur the development of hybrid methods, we propose to test them in the context of the CASP experiment and would like to invite experimental groups to participate in this initiative.",4
687,Remote consultations in paediatric urology-Not just for pandemics?,"Although some centres have successfully integrated remote clinics into their paediatric urological practice, for many, remote clinics have developed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One UK-based institution has integrated remote clinics in their practice for over two years and has developed guidelines considering which conditions may be suitable for remote consultations. These guidelines have been appraised by the European Association of Urology Young Academic Urologists paediatric working group. Through practical experience and anticipated difficulties, we have discussed considerations that paediatric urology departments should ponder when integrating remote clinics into their practice as we move forward from the pandemic.",0
688,Decentralized Machine Autonomy for Manufacturing Servitization,"Blockchain ecosystems are rapidly maturing and meeting the needs of business environments (e.g., industry, manufacturing, and robotics). The decentralized approaches in industries enable novel business concepts, such as machine autonomy and servitization of manufacturing environments. Introducing the distributed ledger technology principles into the machine sharing and servitization economy faces several challenges, and the integration opens new interesting research questions. Our research focuses on data and event models and secure upgradeable smart contract platforms for machine servitization. Our research indicates that with the proposed approaches, we can efficiently separate on- and off-chain data and assure scalability of the DApp without compromising the trust. We demonstrate that the secure upgradeable smart contract platform, which was adapted for machine servitization, supports the business workflow and, at the same time, assures common identification and authorization of all the participants in the system, including people, devices, and legal entities. We present a hybrid decentralized application (DApp) for the servitization of 3D printing. The solution can be used for or easily adapted to other manufacturing domains. It comprises a modular, upgradeable smart contract platform and off-chain machine, customer and web management, and monitoring interfaces. We pay special attention to the data and event models during the design, which are fundamental for the hybrid data storage and DApp architecture and the responsiveness of off-chain interfaces. The smart contract platform uses a proxy contract to control the access of smart contracts and role-based access control in function calls for blockchain users. We deploy and evaluate the DApp in a consortium blockchain network for performance and privacy. All the actors in the solution, including the machines, are identified by their blockchain accounts and are compeers. Our solution thus facilitates integration with the traditional information-communication systems in terms of the hybrid architectures and security standards for smart contract design comparable to those in traditional software engineering.",0
689,Impact of steerable sheaths on contact forces and reconnection sites in ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation,"Background:
        
      
      In preclinical studies, catheter contact force (CF) during radiofrequency ablation correlates with the subsequent lesion size. We investigated the impact of steerable sheaths on ablation CF, its consistency, and wide area circumferential ablation (WACA) line reconnection sites.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Five thousand and sixty-four ablations were analyzed across 60 patients undergoing first-time ablation for persistent AF using a CF-sensing catheter: 19 manual nonsteerable sheath (Manual-NSS), 11 manual steerable sheath, and 30 robotic steerable sheath (Sensei, Hansen Medical Inc.) procedures were studied. Ablation CFs were higher in the steerable sheath groups for all left atrial ablations and also WACA ablations specifically (P < 0.006), but less consistent per WACA segment (P < 0.005). There were significant differences in the CFs around both WACAs by group: in the left WACA CFs were lower with Manual-NSS, other than at the anterior-inferior and posterior-superior regions, and lower in the right WACA, other than the anterior-superior region. There was a difference in the proportion of segments chronically reconnecting across groups: Manual-NSS 26.5%, manual steerable sheath 4.6%, robotic 12% (P < 0.0005). The left atrial appendage/PV ridge and right posterior wall were common sites of reconnection in all groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Steerable sheaths increased ablation CF; however, there were region-specific heterogeneities in the extent of increment, with some segments where they failed to increase CF. Steerable sheath use was associated with reduced WACA-segment reconnection. It may be that the benefits of steerable sheath use in terms of higher CFs could be translated to improved clinical outcomes if regional weaknesses of this technology are taken into account during ablation procedures.",8
690,"Ethical, Legal, and Financial Considerations of Artificial Intelligence in Surgery","Machine learning systems have become integrated into some of the most vital decision-making aspects of humanity, including hiring decisions, loan applications, and automobile safety, to name just a few. As applications increase in both gravity and complexity, the data quality and algorithmic interpretability of the systems must rise to meet those challenges. This is especially vital for navigating the nuances of health care, particularly among the high stakes of surgical operations. In addition to inherent ethical challenges of enabling a ""black box"" system to influence decision-making in patient care, the creation of biased datasets leads to biased algorithms with the power to perpetuate discrimination and reinforce disparities. Transparency and responsibility are paramount to the implementation of artificial intelligence in surgical decision-making and autonomous robotic surgery. Machine learning has been permeating health care across diverse clinical and surgical contexts but continues to face sizable obstacles, including apprehension from patients and providers alike. To integrate the technology fully while upholding standard of care and patient-provider trust, one must acknowledge and address the ethical, financial, and legal implications of using artificial intelligence for patient care.",3
691,"Proprioceptive loss and the perception, control and learning of arm movements in humans: evidence from sensory neuronopathy","It is uncertain how vision and proprioception contribute to adaptation of voluntary arm movements. In normal participants, adaptation to imposed forces is possible with or without vision, suggesting that proprioception is sufficient; in participants with proprioceptive loss (PL), adaptation is possible with visual feedback, suggesting that proprioception is unnecessary. In experiment 1 adaptation to, and retention of, perturbing forces were evaluated in three chronically deafferented participants. They made rapid reaching movements to move a cursor toward a visual target, and a planar robot arm applied orthogonal velocity-dependent forces. Trial-by-trial error correction was observed in all participants. Such adaptation has been characterized with a dual-rate model: a fast process that learns quickly, but retains poorly and a slow process that learns slowly and retains well. Experiment 2 showed that the PL participants had large individual differences in learning and retention rates compared to normal controls. Experiment 3 tested participants' perception of applied forces. With visual feedback, the PL participants could report the perturbation's direction as well as controls; without visual feedback, thresholds were elevated. Experiment 4 showed, in healthy participants, that force direction could be estimated from head motion, at levels close to the no-vision threshold for the PL participants. Our results show that proprioceptive loss influences perception, motor control and adaptation but that proprioception from the moving limb is not essential for adaptation to, or detection of, force fields. The differences in learning and retention seen between the three deafferented participants suggest that they achieve these tasks in idiosyncratic ways after proprioceptive loss, possibly integrating visual and vestibular information with individual cognitive strategies.",6
692,Teammates Instead of Tools: The Impacts of Level of Autonomy on Mission Performance and Human-Agent Teaming Dynamics in Multi-Agent Distributed Teams,"Human-agent teaming (HAT) is becoming more commonplace across industry, military, and consumer settings. Agents are becoming more advanced, more integrated, and more responsible for tasks previously assigned to humans. In addition, the dyadic human-agent teaming nature is evolving from a one-one pair to one-many, in which the human is working with numerous agents to accomplish a task. As capabilities become more advanced and humanlike, the best method for humans and agents to effectively coordinate is still unknown. Therefore, current research must start diverting focus from how many agents can a human manage to how can agents and humans work together effectively. Levels of autonomy (LOAs), or varying levels of responsibility given to the agents, implemented specifically in the decision-making process could potentially address some of the issues related to workload, stress, performance, and trust. This study sought to explore the effects of different LOAs on human-machine team coordination, performance, trust, and decision making in hand with assessments of operator workload and stress in a simulated multi-unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) task. The results of the study can be used to identify human factor roadblocks to effective HAT and provide guidance for future designs of HAT. Additionally, the unique impacts of LOA and autonomous decision making by agents on trust are explored.",4
693,"Reducing readmissions and improving patient experience following urological surgery, through early telephone follow-up","Readmission from urological surgery is common, with a readmission rate for day case surgery of 3.7% and 26% for robot-assisted cystectomy. Readmission to secondary care and representation to primary care are both expensive and preventable. This project aimed to reduce both and also enhance the care of patients following urological surgery in a large tertiary referral centre, within the National Health Service. A retrospective telephone follow-up (TFU) survey was set up in the early postoperatively period to measure reattendance and readmission rates and perception of care received. Patients were also asked to suggest how improvement could be made. Quality improvement tools were used to optimise and review the methods and timing of TFU. TFU was initiated as a strategy to enhance care and reduce readmission rates. Phone calls were targeted to occur between 48 and 72 hours following discharge. During the intervention period, 484 phone calls were attempted with 343 being successful. Reattendance rates were reduced by 13% and patient satisfaction improved by 19.6%, following TFU. This intervention also generated additional income for the organisation and enhanced patient satisfaction in the early postoperative period.",1
694,Would extirpative pelvic surgery improve survival in gynecological metastases of lung cancer? Case report and review of the literature,"Lung cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in the UK and the numbers of new cases increase every year. In contrast to gastrointestinal tumours and breast cancer, lung cancer, metastases to the female genital tract are incredibly rare with only five cases reported with uterine metastases on review of the published English literature. We report an interesting case of successful ongoing management of metastatic lung cancer to the pelvis along with an extensive literature review. A 47-year-old lady with recurrent respiratory tract symptoms and chest pain was diagnosed with advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer (Stage T4N2M1A). Five years following diagnosis and several cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, aged 52, she complained of post-menopausal bleeding and pelvic discomfort. An endometrial biopsy confirmed a malignancy morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to her lung adenocarcinoma, in keeping with metastatic disease. She underwent robotic surgery to excise the pelvic organs and successfully gain local disease control. The patient remains clinically stable 3 years following hysterectomy. Although metastases of lung cancer to uterus are very rare, any patient with abnormal uterine bleeding with known cancer should be investigated thoroughly to rule out metastatic disease. Combined multimodal treatment as in this case may increase overall survival.",0
695,Prevention and Management of Postoperative Ileus: A Review of Current Practice,"Postoperative ileus (POI) has long been a challenging clinical problem for both patients and healthcare physicians alike. Although a standardized definition does not exist, it generally includes symptoms of intolerance to diet, lack of passing stool, abdominal distension, or flatus. Not only does prolonged POI increase patient discomfort and morbidity, but it is possibly the single most important factor that results in prolongation of the length of hospital stay with a significant deleterious effect on healthcare costs in surgical patients. Determining the exact pathogenesis of POI is difficult to achieve; however, it can be conceptually divided into patient-related and operative factors, which can further be broadly classified as neurogenic, inflammatory, hormonal, and pharmacological mechanisms. Different strategies have been introduced aimed at improving the quality of perioperative care by reducing perioperative morbidity and length of stay, which include Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, minimally invasive surgical approaches, and the use of specific pharmaceutical therapies. Recent studies have shown that the ERAS pathway and laparoscopic approach are generally effective in reducing patient morbidity with early return of gut function. Out of many studies on pharmacological agents over the recent years, alvimopan has shown the most promising results. However, due to its potential complications and cost, its clinical use is limited. Therefore, this article aimed to review the pathophysiology of POI and explore recent advances in treatment modalities and prevention of postoperative ileus.",0
696,Dopamine modulates reward-related vigor,"Subjects routinely control the vigor with which they emit motoric responses. However, the bulk of formal treatments of decision-making ignores this dimension of choice. A recent theoretical study suggested that action vigor should be influenced by experienced average reward rate and that this rate is encoded by tonic dopamine in the brain. We previously examined how average reward rate modulates vigor as exemplified by response times and found a measure of agreement with the first suggestion. In the current study, we examined the second suggestion, namely the potential influence of dopamine signaling on vigor. Ninety healthy subjects participated in a double-blind experiment in which they received one of the following: placebo, L-DOPA (which increases dopamine levels in the brain), or citalopram (which has a selective, if complex, effect on serotonin levels). Subjects performed multiple trials of a rewarded odd-ball discrimination task in which we varied the potential reward over time in order to exercise the putative link between vigor and average reward rate. Replicating our previous findings, we found that a significant fraction of the variance in subjects' responses could be explained by our experimentally manipulated changes in average reward rate. Crucially, this relationship was significantly stronger under L-Dopa than under Placebo, suggesting that the impact of average reward levels on action vigor is indeed subject to a dopaminergic influence.",4

698,The Values Supporting the Creativity of Employees,"In Industry 4.0 completely new production worlds are emerging, where robots are becoming a key element and where common human skill activities and thinking are commonly surpassed. The growing degree of automation and the interconnection of the digital and the real-world create an environment that requires a set of interdisciplinary skills. For the sustainability of enterprises in this environment, human creativity acquires an irreplaceable role. The aim is to compare the application of selected values in corporate culture, which creates a space for increasing the creativity of employees from the perspective of different sizes of enterprises. The research sample consists of 1,716 companies of the Czech and Slovakia that participated in the questionnaire survey. The results of the independent T-test confirmed significant differences in the applied values between the countries being compared. Differences in terms of business size have been further explored through the ANOVA test and the Tukey HSD test. The results subsequently confirmed that the values: work meaningfulness, passion for work, and trust are applied more significantly to microenterprises in both the countries, creating an environment that supports creativity.",4
699,Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: Single Center Experience on Robotic Assisted First Rib Resection and Literature Review,"Background:
        
      
      Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a pathological condition caused by a narrowing between the clavicle and first rib leading to a compression of the neurovascular bundle to the upper extremity. The incidence of TOS is probably nowadays underestimated because the diagnosis could be very challenging without a thorough clinical examination along with appropriate clinical testing. Beside traditional supra-, infraclavicular or transaxillary approaches, the robotic assisted first rib resection has been gaining importance in the last few years.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of all patients who underwent robotic assisted first rib resection due to TOS at Lucerne Cantonal Hospital and then we performed a narrative review of the English literature using PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Scopus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between June 2020 and November 2021, eleven robotic assisted first rib resections were performed due to TOS at Lucerne Cantonal Hospital. Median length of stay was 2 days (Standard Deviation: +/- 0.67 days). Median surgery time was 180 min (Standard Deviation: +/- 36.5). No intra-operative complications were reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic assisted first rib resection could represent a safe and feasible option in expert hands for the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome.",0
700,"Robotic Approach to Creation of Continent Catheterisable Channels-Technical Steps, Current Status, and Review of Outcomes","Purpose: To report the current status of Robotic approach to creation of Catheterisable channel (CC) with the author's personal experience compared to published literature on technical steps, follow up, and outcomes. Methods: CC data was extracted from the prospective database set up for all Robotic pediatric urology procedures performed by the author at his institution. A literature search was then performed to look at the evidence base. Results: Eighteen consecutive cases (8M:7F) of Robotic approach to creation of CC was identified and included. All attempted cases were successfully completed without any conversion to open approach. Median age at surgery was 10.75 years (IQR 6.9-16.5); Median OT 197 min (IQR 131-295) with concomitant procedures in 4 cases. Appendix was used in 14 cases as CC conduit and distal ureter in 4 cases. Median Length of stay (LOS) was 2.75 days (IQR 2-6) and Median FU 27.3 m. Whilst FU duration is comparable to published series, average OT and LOS was much lower in this series. The LOS in this robotic series is much lower than the author's experience with open approach (2.75 vs. 5.8 days). No major complications postoperatively except for one exit site wound infection managed conservatively. None of the CC have been revised in this series and all channels are patent with 12 F or 14 F admissible catheter size. There were no cases of incontinence related to technique of creation of CC and no incidence of exit site stomal stenosis with use of ACE stopper until channel matures and Clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) is established. Conclusion: Robotic approach to CC is feasible, safe with excellent outcomes and minimum morbidity. Robotic complex bladder reconstructive surgery offers some advantages to children compared to open approach but is only currently performed in few tertiary centers with expertise.",3
701,The Role of the Single Incision Laparoscopic Approach in Liver and Pancreatic Resectional Surgery,"Introduction. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has gained increasing support over the last few years. The aim of this narrative review is to analyse the published evidence on the use and potential benefits of SILS in hepatic and pancreatic resectional surgery for benign and malignant pathology. Methods. Pubmed and Embase databases were searched using the search terms ""single incision laparoscopic"", ""single port laparoscopic"", ""liver surgery"", and ""pancreas surgery"". Results. Twenty relevant manuscripts for liver and 9 for pancreatic SILS resections were identified. With regard to liver surgery, despite the lack of comparative studies with other minimal invasive techniques, outcomes have been acceptable when certain limitations are taken into account. For pancreatic resections, when compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach, SILS produced comparable results with regard to intra- and postoperative parameters, including length of hospitalisation and complications. Similarly, the results were comparable to robotic pancreatectomies, with the exception of the longer operative time reported with the robotic approach. Discussion. Despite the limitations, the published evidence supports that SILS is safe and feasible for liver and pancreatic resections when performed by experienced teams in the tertiary setting. However, no substantial benefit has been identified yet, especially compared to other minimal invasive techniques.",3
702,Paediatric giant cervicomediastinal thymolipoma,"We report a case of a 11-year-old boy who presented with a massive soft tissue right cervical painless and progressive lesion displacing trachea to the left and extending into the anteriosuperior mediastinum which was diagnosed to be a lipomatous mass on chest CT scan. Subsequent biopsy and total excision proved it to be a giant cervicomediastinal thymolipoma. It was successfully excised with excellent prognosis and long-term results. A giant paediatric cervicomediastinal thymolipoma is a rare, benign, mediastinal mass of thymic origin. It may remain asymptomatic despite massive size and up to 50% in some series are associated with autoimmune disease. CT scan gives fat density and encapsulated benign nature and biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. Preoperative tissue diagnosis is important as now the availability of thoracoscopic option is best suited to reduce morbidity. Treatment of choice is total excision using open surgical, minimal invasive techniques or robotic surgery and the prognosis is excellent.",0
703,Diagnostic potential of radiological apical tumor involvement,"We commend Veerman et al. for investigating the diagnostic performance of radiological apical tumor involvement (radATI) in preoperative prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with localized prostate cancer. This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MRI to detect pathological ATI (pathATI) in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy specimens. They found patients with radATI more likely to develop biochemical recurrence (BCR), p = 0.003, and have apical positive surgical margins (APSM), p = 0.004. We believe that the author's acknowledgement of the relationship between tumor location and cancer risk is an important step in the classification of prostate cancer. An important question that is under addressed is, what is it about apical tumors that carry additional risk? Higher rates of PSM due to incomplete surgical excision may contribute to increased recurrence risk in the apex. If this is the case, surgical management must be tailored by a tumor location-based risk assessment. The literature suggests that a single APSM may be clinically insignificant for long-term outcomes. Conversely, the authors also recommend radATI be treated with reduced apical nerve sparing to avoid APSM. We believe that this approach may lead to overtreatment in the presence of an otherwise good prognosis. We believe the extent of APSMs upon diagnosis would be an interesting topic for further investigation. The authors may also wish to perform multivariable analysis for the effect of radATI on BCR. We believe that MRI may play a critical role in enhancing diagnosis and prognostication of prostate cancer.",0
704,Stroke survivor perceptions of using an exoskeleton during acute gait rehabilitation,"Robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) devices allow intensive high repetition of the gait cycle in individuals with locomotor disability, with reduced therapist effort. In addition to usual rehabilitation, RAGT post-stroke improves the likelihood of regaining independent walking, with maximum efficacy identified in the acute and subacute phases of stroke. This study explores the usability and acceptance of RAGT among persons with stroke in an acute hospital setting and examines users' perceptions of two different modes of robotic assistance provided during rehabilitation. A mixed-methods approach comprised semi-structed interviews of end-user perspectives of RAGT in an acute hospital setting following stroke and two 10-point Likert scales rating how comfortable and how natural robotic gait felt using different assistance modes. Content analysis of qualitative data was undertaken with results synthesised by common meaning units. Quantitative data were reported using summary statistics, with Spearmann's correlation co-efficient examining the relationship between Likert scale ratings and measures of participants' stroke related disability. Ten individuals (6 men; 4 women; mean age of 64.5. ± 13 years) were recruited in an acute hospital setting following admission with a stroke diagnosis. Content analysis of interview transcripts identified discussion units centring around positive aspects of how helpful the device was, negative aspects related to set-up time, weight of the device and multiple instructions delivered during use. Initially participants identified that the device could look intimidating, and they feared falling in the device but they subsequently identified the correct mindset for using the device is to trust the technology and not be afraid. Mean ratings for device comfort (7.94 ± 1.4) and how natural walking felt (7.05 ± 1.9) were favourable. Interestingly, a strong relationship was identified, whereby the higher the level of disability, the more natural participants rated walking in the device during maximal assistance mode (rho = 0.62; p = 0.138). This study suggests individuals in the early phases of stroke perceive RAGT to be acceptable and helpful in the main, with some associated negative aspects. Walking in the device was rated as comfortable and natural. Those with greater disability rated the assisted walking as more natural.",5
705,Active inference and epistemic value,"We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.",2
706,Understanding volume-outcome relationships in nephrectomy and cystectomy for cancer: evidence from the UK Getting it Right First Time programme,"Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate volume-outcome relationships in nephrectomy and cystectomy for cancer.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Data were extracted from the UK Hospital Episodes Statistics database, which records data on all National Health Service (NHS) hospital admissions in the England. Data were included for a 5-year period (April 2013-March 2018 inclusive) and data on emergency and paediatric admissions were excluded. Data were extracted on the NHS trust and surgeon undertaking the procedure, the surgical technique used (open, laparoscopic or robot-assisted) and length of hospital stay during the procedure. This dataset was supplemented by data on mortality from the UK Office for National Statistics. A number of volume thresholds and volume measures were investigated. Multilevel modelling was used to adjust for hierarchy and confounding factors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data were available for 18 107 nephrectomy and 6762 cystectomy procedures for cancer. There was little evidence of trust or surgeon volume influencing readmission rates or mortality. There was some evidence of shorter length of hospital stay for high-volume surgeons, although the volume measure and threshold used were important.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We found little evidence that further centralization of nephrectomy or cystectomy for cancer surgery will improve the patient outcomes investigated. It may be that length of stay can be optimized though training and support for lower-volume centres, rather than further centralization.",5
707,Surgical biomicroscopy-guided intra-operative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) image super-resolution,"Purpose:
        
      
      Intra-retinal delivery of novel sight-restoring therapies will require the precision of robotic systems accompanied by excellent visualisation of retinal layers. Intra-operative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) provides cross-sectional retinal images in real time but at the cost of image quality that is insufficient for intra-retinal therapy delivery.This paper proposes a super-resolution methodology that improves iOCT image quality leveraging spatiotemporal consistency of incoming iOCT video streams.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      To overcome the absence of ground truth high-resolution (HR) images, we first generate HR iOCT images by fusing spatially aligned iOCT video frames. Then, we automatically assess the quality of the HR images on key retinal layers using a deep semantic segmentation model. Finally, we use image-to-image translation models (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN) to enhance the quality of LR images via quality transfer from the estimated HR domain.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our proposed methodology generates iOCT images of improved quality according to both full-reference and no-reference metrics. A qualitative study with expert clinicians also confirms the improvement in the delineation of pertinent layers and in the reduction of artefacts. Furthermore, our approach outperforms conventional denoising filters and the learning-based state-of-the-art.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results indicate that the learning-based methods using the estimated, through our pipeline, HR domain can be used to enhance the iOCT image quality. Therefore, the proposed method can computationally augment the capabilities of iOCT imaging helping this modality support the vitreoretinal surgical interventions of the future.",4
708,A neuronal correlate of insect stereopsis,"A puzzle for neuroscience-and robotics-is how insects achieve surprisingly complex behaviours with such tiny brains. One example is depth perception via binocular stereopsis in the praying mantis, a predatory insect. Praying mantids use stereopsis, the computation of distances from disparities between the two retinal images, to trigger a raptorial strike of their forelegs when prey is within reach. The neuronal basis of this ability is entirely unknown. Here we show the first evidence that individual neurons in the praying mantis brain are tuned to specific disparities and eccentricities, and thus locations in 3D-space. Like disparity-tuned cortical cells in vertebrates, the responses of these mantis neurons are consistent with linear summation of binocular inputs followed by an output nonlinearity. Our study not only proves the existence of disparity sensitive neurons in an insect brain, it also reveals feedback connections hitherto undiscovered in any animal species.",6
709,Holmium laser enucleation versus simple prostatectomy for treating large prostates: Results of a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare and evaluate the safety and efficacy of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) and simple prostatectomy for large prostate burdens, as discussion and debate continue about the optimal surgical intervention for this common pathology.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A systematic search was conducted for studies comparing HoLEP with simple prostatectomy [open (OP), robot-assisted, laparoscopic] using a sensitive strategy and in accordance with Cochrane collaboration guidelines. Primary parameters of interest were objective measurements including maximum urinary flow rate (Q max) and post-void residual urine volume (PVR), and subjective outcomes including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life (QoL). Secondary outcomes of interest included volume of tissue retrieved, catheterisation time, hospital stay, blood loss and serum sodium decrease. Data on baseline characteristics and complications were also collected. Where possible, comparable data were combined and meta-analysis was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all, 310 articles were identified and after screening abstracts (114) and full manuscripts (14), three randomised studies (263 patients) were included, which met our pre-defined inclusion criteria. All these compared HoLEP with OP. The mean transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) volume was 113.9 mL in the HoLEP group and 119.4 mL in the OP group. There was no statistically significant difference in Q max, PVR, IPSS and QoL at 12 and 24 months between the two interventions. OP was associated with a significantly shorter operative time (P = 0.01) and greater tissue retrieved (P < 0.001). However, with HoLEP there was significantly less blood loss (P < 0.001), patients had a shorter hospital stay (P = 0.03), and were catheterised for significantly fewer hours (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the total number of complications recorded amongst HoLEP and OP (P = 0.80).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The results of the meta-analysis have shown that HoLEP and OP possess similar overall efficacy profiles for both objective and subjective disease status outcome measures. This review shows these improvements persist to at least the 24 month follow-up point. Further randomised studies are warranted to fully determine the optimal surgical intervention for large prostate burdens.",2
710,Open Versus Robotic Cystectomy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis Comparing Survival Outcomes,"Background:
        
      
      To assess the differential effect of robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) versus open radical cystectomy (ORC) on survival outcomes in matched analyses performed on a large multicentric cohort.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The study included 9757 patients with urothelial bladder cancer (BCa) treated in a consecutive manner at each of 25 institutions. All patients underwent radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. To adjust for potential selection bias, propensity score matching 2:1 was performed with two ORC patients matched to one RARC patient. The propensity-matched cohort included 1374 patients. Multivariable competing risk analyses accounting for death of other causes, tested association of surgical technique with recurrence and cancer specific mortality (CSM), before and after propensity score matching.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 767 (7.8%) patients underwent RARC and 8990 (92.2%) ORC. The median follow-up before and after propensity matching was 81 and 102 months, respectively. In the overall population, the 3-year recurrence rates and CSM were 37% vs. 26% and 34% vs. 24% for ORC vs. RARC (all p values > 0.1), respectively. On multivariable Cox regression analyses, RARC and ORC had similar recurrence and CSM rates before and after matching (all p values > 0.1).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients treated with RARC and ORC have similar survival outcomes. This data is helpful in consulting patients until long term survival outcomes of level one evidence is available.",2
711,Eye Tracking Technology in Endoscopy - Looking to the Future,"The visual patterns of an endoscopist, i.e., what the endoscopist is looking at during luminal endoscopy is an interesting area with an evolving evidence base. The tools required for gaze analysis have become cheaper and more easily accessible. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken identifying 19 relevant papers. Gaze analysis has been used to identify certain visual patterns associated with higher polyp detection rates. There have also been increasing applications of gaze analysis as an objective study tool to compare the effectiveness of endoscopic imaging technologies. Gaze analysis also has potential to be incorporated into endoscopic training. Eye movements have been used to control and steer a robotic endoscope. This review presents the current evidence available in this novel and evolving field of endoscopic research.",0
712,The Future of Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders: A Research Perspective,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sits at the epicenter of a spectrum of related conditions (often referred to as obsessive-compulsive related disorders (OCRD) or obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSD)) that can be as disabling as they are varied in presentation. Research in the field now encompasses diverse disciplines ranging from inflammatory mechanisms to computational psychiatry, to neurocognitive endophenotypes to functional imaging to pharmacogenomics to brain stimulation approaches. As these disorders become more clearly elucidated, there is a need to continually re-evaluate the implications of research findings and to incorporate these findings into new treatment approaches that benefit both patients and clinicians. Even the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) is intended to be flexible and to incorporate validated and reliable biomarkers and neuroscience findings as they become available. This concluding chapter highlights just a few areas of study that promise to influence our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical practice of OCRD. These include patient-centered outcomes research, the study of developmental brain trajectories in spectrum conditions, robot models of OCRDs, goal-directed versus habit-based behaviors, pharmacogenomics, problematic use of the Internet, and digital interventions. For example, digital medicine may become increasingly useful by identifying patients early on in the course of their illness; providing biomarkers to subtype patients; predicting treatment response; serving as a more proximal outcome measure of treatment response; or providing easily accessible and less costly forms of care. In order to address unmet clinical needs in OCRD, it is helpful to take an interdisciplinary perspective, and the work described in this collection of articles is likely to be invaluable in shaping the future of the field.",0
713,Delivery of Healthcare Resources Using Autonomous Ground Vehicle Convoy Systems: An Overview,"Utilizing military convoys in humanitarian missions allows for increased overall performance of healthcare logistical operations. To properly gauge performance of autonomous ground convoy systems in military humanitarian operations, a proper framework for comparative performance metrics needs to be established. Past efforts in this domain have had heavy focus on narrow and specialized areas of convoy performance such as human factors, trust metrics, or string stability analysis. This article reviews available Army doctrine for manned convoy requirements toward healthcare missions and establishes a framework to compare performance of autonomous convoys, using metrics such as spacing error, separation distance, and string stability. After developing a framework of comparison for the convoy systems, this article compares the performance of two autonomous convoys with unique convoy control strategies to demonstrate the application and utility of the framework.",4
714,Dissociable contributions of ventromedial prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex to value-guided choice,"Two long-standing traditions have highlighted cortical decision mechanisms in the parietal and prefrontal cortices of primates, but it has not been clear how these processes differ, or when each cortical region may influence behaviour. Recent data from ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have suggested one possible axis on which the two decision processes might be delineated. Fast decisions may be resolved primarily by parietal mechanisms, whereas decisions made without time pressure may rely on prefrontal mechanisms. Here, we report direct evidence for such dissociation. During decisions under time pressure, a value comparison process was evident in PPC, but not in vmPFC. Value-related activity was still found in vmPFC under time pressure. However, vmPFC represented overall input value rather than compared output value. In contrast, when decisions were made without time pressure, vmPFC transitioned to encode a value comparison while value-related parameters were entirely absent from PPC. Furthermore, under time pressure, decision performance was primarily governed by PPC, while it was dominated by vmPFC at longer decision times. These data demonstrate that parallel cortical mechanisms may resolve the same choices in differing circumstances, and offer an explanation of the diverse neural signals reported in vmPFC and PPC during value-guided choice.",4
715,Prediction of larynx function using multichannel surface EMG classification,"Total laryngectomy (TL) affects critical functions such as swallowing, coughing and speaking. An artificial, bio-engineered larynx (ABL), operated via myoelectric signals, may improve quality of life for TL patients. To evaluate the efficacy of using surface electromyography (sEMG) as a control signal to predict instances of swallowing, coughing and speaking, sEMG was recorded from submental, intercostal and diaphragm muscles. The cohort included TL and control participants. Swallowing, coughing, speaking and movement actions were recorded, and a range of classifiers were investigated for prediction of these actions. Our algorithm achieved F1-scores of 76.0 ± 4.4 % (swallows), 93.8 ± 2.8 % (coughs) and 70.5 ± 5.4 % (speech) for controls, and 67.7 ± 4.4 % (swallows), 71.0 ± 9.1 % (coughs) and 78.0 ± 3.8 % (speech) for TLs, using a random forest (RF) classifier. 75.1 ± 6.9 % of swallows were detected within 500 ms of onset in the controls, and 63.1 ± 6.1 % in TLs. sEMG can be used to predict critical larynx movements, although a viable ABL requires improvements. Results are particularly encouraging as they encompass a TL cohort. An ABL could alleviate many challenges faced by laryngectomees. This study represents a promising step toward realising such a device.",1
716,Above and Beyond Robotic Surgery and 3D Modelling in Paediatric Cancer Surgery,"Although the survival rates for children's cancers have more than doubled in the last few decades, the surgical practise has not significantly changed. Among the most recent innovations introduced in the clinic, robotic surgery and augmented reality are two of the most promising, even if they are not widespread. The increased flexibility of the motion, the magnification of the surgical field and the tremor reduction provided by robotic surgery have been beneficial to perform complex oncological procedures in children. Besides, augmented reality has been proven helpful in planning for tumour removal, facilitating early discrimination between cancer and healthy organs. Nowadays, research in the field of surgical oncology is moving fast, and new technologies and innovations wich will help to shape a new way to perform cancer surgery. Paediatric surgeons need to be ready to adopt these novel devices and intraoperative techniques to allow more radical tumour resections with fewer complications. This review aims to present the mechanism of action and indications of several novel technologies such as optical imaging surgery, high definition cameras, and intraoperative loco-regional treatments. We hope this will enhance early adoption and more research on how to employ technology for the benefit of children.",1
717,Endoscopic preperitoneal parastomal hernia repair (ePauli repair) : an observational study,"Background:
        
      
      Aspiring endoscopic surgery with extraperitoneal mesh application to avoid adhesion and pain from mesh fixation, we adopted the principles of the open Pauli repair of parastomal hernia (PSH). We have termed the procedure ePauli repair. The aim of this account is to inform about feasibility and adverse reactions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with PSH selected for ePauli repair with transversus abdominis release (TAR) were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Patients were operated with laparoscopic or robotic assistance and endoscopic Rives-Stoppa repair in cases with concomitant midline hernia. Coated meshes or a buffer mesh was used in the retromuscular pocket for this modification of the Sugarbaker principle.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fifteen patients were included: six patients were operated laparoscopically and nine patients with robotic assistance. The median age of the stomas was 33 months (7-313). Five PSHs were recurrent after previous repairs. Median operating time without midline hernia repair was 156 min (107-233) and with midline hernia repair 241 min (176-286). One serosa lesion arose during operation, prompting intraoperative revision of the ostomy without postoperative morbidity. Two patients had postoperative obstruction and were readmitted to operation: one with multiple adhesions and one had kinking of the stoma bowel caused by insufficient incision of the transversalis fascia. No infections or seromas have been observed. One patient had discoloring of the flank with spontaneous remission, and one patient had recurrence. Median postoperative admission time was 3 days (1-19). Median follow-up is 10 months (0-27).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ePauli repair is technically challenging but feasible. With our limited experience, we are encouraged with the pain, complication, and functional summary after ePauli repair and hopeful for the recurrence profile. ePauli/TAR is not for every patient or every surgeon and whether it should be restrained to recurrent PSH or be offered as first-line treatment for PSH is disputable.",9
718,A practical tool for monitoring the performance of measuring systems in a laboratory network: report of an ACB Working Group,"Background A logical consequence of the introduction of robotics and high-capacity analysers has seen a consolidation to larger units. This requires new structures and quality systems to ensure that laboratories deliver consistent and comparable results. Methods A spreadsheet program was designed to accommodate results from up to 12 different instruments/laboratories and present IQC data, i.e. Levey-Jennings and Youden plots and comprehensive numerical tables of the performance of each item. Input of data was made possible by a 'data loader' by which IQC data from the individual instruments could be transferred to the spreadsheet program on line. Results A set of real data from laboratories is used to populate the data loader and the networking software program. Examples are present from the analysis of variance components, the Levey-Jennings and Youden plots. Conclusions This report presents a software package that allows the simultaneous management and detailed monitoring of the performance of up to 12 different instruments/laboratories in a fully interactive mode. The system allows a quality manager of networked laboratories to have a continuous updated overview of the performance. This software package has been made available at the ACB website.",0
719,Rapid visuomotor feedback gains are tuned to the task dynamics,"Adaptation to novel dynamics requires learning a motor memory, or a new pattern of predictive feedforward motor commands. Recently, we demonstrated the upregulation of rapid visuomotor feedback gains early in curl force field learning, which decrease once a predictive motor memory is learned. However, even after learning is complete, these feedback gains are higher than those observed in the null field trials. Interestingly, these upregulated feedback gains in the curl field were not observed in a constant force field. Therefore, we suggest that adaptation also involves selectively tuning the feedback sensitivity of the sensorimotor control system to the environment. Here, we test this hypothesis by measuring the rapid visuomotor feedback gains after subjects adapt to a variety of novel dynamics generated by a robotic manipulandum in three experiments. To probe the feedback gains, we measured the magnitude of the motor response to rapid shifts in the visual location of the hand during reaching. While the feedback gain magnitude remained similar over a larger than a fourfold increase in constant background load, the feedback gains scaled with increasing lateral resistance and increasing instability. The third experiment demonstrated that the feedback gains could also be independently tuned to perturbations to the left and right, depending on the lateral resistance, demonstrating the fractionation of feedback gains to environmental dynamics. Our results show that the sensorimotor control system regulates the gain of the feedback system as part of the adaptation process to novel dynamics, appropriately tuning them to the environment.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we test whether rapid visuomotor feedback responses are selectively tuned to the task dynamics. The responses do not exhibit gain scaling, but they do vary with the level and stability of task dynamics. Moreover, these feedback gains are independently tuned to perturbations to the left and right, depending on these dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the sensorimotor control system regulates the feedback gain as part of the adaptation process, tuning them appropriately to the environment.",0
720,Machine learning for classifying tuberculosis drug-resistance from DNA sequencing data,"Motivation:
        
      
      Correct and rapid determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) resistance against available tuberculosis (TB) drugs is essential for the control and management of TB. Conventional molecular diagnostic test assumes that the presence of any well-studied single nucleotide polymorphisms is sufficient to cause resistance, which yields low sensitivity for resistance classification.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      Given the availability of DNA sequencing data from MTB, we developed machine learning models for a cohort of 1839 UK bacterial isolates to classify MTB resistance against eight anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, streptomycin) and to classify multi-drug resistance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared to previous rules-based approach, the sensitivities from the best-performing models increased by 2-4% for isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol to 97% (P < 0.01), respectively; for ciprofloxacin and multi-drug resistant TB, they increased to 96%. For moxifloxacin and ofloxacin, sensitivities increased by 12 and 15% from 83 and 81% based on existing known resistance alleles to 95% and 96% (P < 0.01), respectively. Particularly, our models improved sensitivities compared to the previous rules-based approach by 15 and 24% to 84 and 87% for pyrazinamide and streptomycin (P < 0.01), respectively. The best-performing models increase the area-under-the-ROC curve by 10% for pyrazinamide and streptomycin (P < 0.01), and 4-8% for other drugs (P < 0.01).

721,Evaluation of a remote-controlled laparoscopic camera holder for basic laparoscopic skills acquisition: a randomized controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Unsteady camera movement and poor visualization contribute to a difficult learning curve for laparoscopic surgery. Remote-controlled camera holders (RCHs) aim to mitigate these factors and may be used to overcome barriers to learning. Our aim was to evaluate performance benefits to laparoscopic skill acquisition in novices using a RCH.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Novices were randomized into groups using a human camera assistant (HCA) or the FreeHand v1.0 RCH and trained in the (E-BLUS) curriculum. After completing training, a surgical workload questionnaire (SURG-TLX) was issued to participants.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty volunteers naïve in laparoscopic skill were randomized into control and intervention groups (n = 20) with intention-to-treat analysis. Each participant received up to 10 training sessions using the E-BLUS curriculum. Competency was reached in the peg transfer task in 5.5 and 7.6 sessions for the ACH and HCA groups, respectively (P = 0.015), and 3.6 and 6.8 sessions for the laparoscopic suturing task (P = 0.0004). No significance differences were achieved in the circle cutting (P = 0.18) or needle guidance tasks (P = 0.32). The RCH group experienced significantly lower workload (P = 0.014) due to lower levels of distraction (P = 0.047).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Remote-controlled camera holders have demonstrated the potential to significantly benefit intra-operative performance and surgical experience where camera movement is minimal. Future high-quality studies are needed to evaluate RCHs in clinical practice.

722,Artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and management of arrhythmias,"The field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP) had adopted simple artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for decades. Recent renewed interest in deep learning techniques has opened new frontiers in electrocardiography analysis including signature identification of diseased states. Artificial intelligence advances coupled with simultaneous rapid growth in computational power, sensor technology, and availability of web-based platforms have seen the rapid growth of AI-aided applications and big data research. Changing lifestyles with an expansion of the concept of internet of things and advancements in telecommunication technology have opened doors to population-based detection of atrial fibrillation in ways, which were previously unimaginable. Artificial intelligence-aided advances in 3D cardiac imaging heralded the concept of virtual hearts and the simulation of cardiac arrhythmias. Robotics, completely non-invasive ablation therapy, and the concept of extended realities show promise to revolutionize the future of EP. In this review, we discuss the impact of AI and recent technological advances in all aspects of arrhythmia care.",0
723,Virtual Reality and Empathy Enhancement: Ethical Aspects,"The history of humankind is full of examples that indicate a constant desire to make human beings more moral. Nowadays, technological breakthroughs might have a significant impact on our moral character and abilities. This is the case of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. The aim of this paper is to consider the ethical aspects of the use of VR in enhancing empathy. First, we will offer an introduction to VR, explaining its fundamental features, devices and concepts. Then, we will approach the characterization of VR as an ""empathy machine,"" showing why this medium has aroused so much interest and why, nevertheless, we do not believe it is the ideal way to enhance empathy. As an alternative, we will consider fostering empathy-related abilities through virtual embodiment in avatars. In the conclusion, however, we will examine some of the serious concerns related to the ethical relevance of empathy and will defend the philosophical case for a reason-guided empathy, also suggesting specific guidelines for possible future developments of empathy enhancement projects through VR embodied experiences.",3
724,Placebo From an Enactive Perspective,"Due to their complexity and variability, placebo effects remain controversial. We suggest this is also due to a set of problematic assumptions (dualism, reductionism, individualism, passivity). We critically assess current explanations and empirical evidence and propose an alternative theoretical framework-the enactive approach to life and mind-based on recent developments in embodied cognitive science. We review core enactive concepts such as autonomy, agency, and sense-making. Following these ideas, we propose a move from binary distinctions (e.g., conscious vs. non-conscious) to the more workable categories of reflective and pre-reflective activity. We introduce an ontology of individuation, following the work of Gilbert Simondon, that allow us to see placebo interventions not as originating causal chains, but as modulators and triggers in the regulation of tensions between ongoing embodied and interpersonal processes. We describe these interrelated processes involving looping effects through three intertwined dimensions of embodiment: organic, sensorimotor, and intersubjective. Finally, we defend the need to investigate therapeutic interactions in terms of participatory sense-making, going beyond the identification of individual social traits (e.g., empathy, trust) that contribute to placebo effects. We discuss resonances and differences between the enactive proposal, popular explanations such as expectations and conditioning, and other approaches based on meaning responses and phenomenological/ecological ideas.",4
725,First Multi-Center All-Comers Study for the Aquablation Procedure,"Waterjet-based prostate resection (Aquablation procedure) is an increasingly recognized treatment for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the Aquablation procedure in the commercial setting in 178 men at five sites. The mean prostate volume was 59 cc. The procedure time averaged 24 min and total anesthesia duration was 50 min. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) decreased from 21.6 at the baseline to 6.5 at the 12-month follow-up, a 15.3-point improvement (p < 0.0001). The maximum urinary flow rate increased from 10 cc/s at the baseline to 20.8 cc/s at month 12 (increase of 11.8 cc, p < 0.0001). Ejaculatory function was relatively preserved. Prostate volume assessed with transrectal ultrasound decreased 36% by month three. Five patients (2.7%) underwent a transfusion in the first week after the procedure. Real-world evidence shows that Aquablation is safe and effective for the treatment of BPH.",2
726,Beamline B21: high-throughput small-angle X-ray scattering at Diamond Light Source,"B21 is a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) beamline with a bending magnet source in the 3 GeV storage ring at the Diamond Light Source Ltd synchrotron in the UK. The beamline utilizes a double multi-layer monochromator and a toroidal focusing optic to deliver 2 × 1012 photons per second to a 34 × 40 µm (FWHM) focal spot at the in-vacuum Eiger 4M (Dectris) detector. A high-performance liquid chromatography system and a liquid-handling robot make it possible to load solution samples into a temperature-controlled in-vacuum sample cell with a high level of automation. Alternatively, a range of viscous or solid materials may be loaded manually using a range of custom sample cells. A default scattering vector range from 0.0026 to 0.34 Å-1 and low instrument background make B21 convenient for measuring a wide range of biological macromolecules. The beamline has run a full user programme since 2013.",7
727,Detailed analysis of patient-reported lower urinary tract symptoms and effect on quality of life after robotic radical prostatectomy,"Objective:
        
      
      To prospectively evaluate short- to medium-term patient-reported lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and their effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using validated questionnaires in a large cohort of patients following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      HRQoL and LUTS outcomes were prospectively assessed in 357 consecutive men undergoing RARP at a single center from 2012 to 2015 using the functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (FACT-P) and the international consultation on incontinence modular questionnaire-male LUTS (ICIQ-MLUTS). Questionnaires were administered at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and ANOVA.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Questionnaire completion rates were high (over 60% of eligible men completed 18-month follow-up). Mean Total FACT-P did not significantly change after RARP: 125.95 (standard deviation [SD] = 19.82) at baseline and 125.86 (SD = 21.14) at 18-months (P = 0.55). Mean total ICIQ-MLUTS also remained unchanged: 18.69 (SD = 10.70) at baseline and 18.76 (SD = 11.33) at 18-months (P = 0.11). Mean voiding score significantly reduced from 10.34 (SD = 5.78) at baseline to 6.33 (SD = 3.99) at 6 months after RARP (P<0.001). A reciprocal significant increase in storage score was observed: 5.34 (SD = 4.26) at baseline, 9.65 (SD = 5.71) at 6 months (P<0.001). Subanalyses of ICIQ-MLUTS scores revealed increases in storage symptoms were exclusively within urinary incontinence domains and included significant increases in both urge and stress urinary incontinence scores.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Overall, patient-reported outcome measures evaluating HRQoL and LUTS do not significantly change after RARP. Detailed analysis reveals significant changes within LUTS domains do occur after surgery which could be overlooked if only total LUTS scores are reported.",2
728,Robotic right hemicolectomy: Analysis of 108 consecutive procedures and multidimensional assessment of the learning curve,"Purpose:
        
      
      Surgeons tend to view the robotic right colectomy (RRC) as an ideal beginning procedure to gain proficiency in robotic general and colorectal surgery. Nevertheless, oncological RRC, especially if performed with intracorporeal ileocolic anastomosis confectioning, cannot be considered a technically easier procedure. The aim of this study was to assess the learning curve of the RRC performed for oncological purposes and to evaluate its safety and efficacy investigating the perioperative and pathology outcomes in the different learning phases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data on a consecutive series of 108 patients undergoing RRC with intracorporeal anastomosis between June 2011 and September 2015 at our institution were prospectively collected to evaluate surgical and short-term oncological outcomes. CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) and Risk-Adjusted (RA) CUSUM analysis were performed in order to perform a multidimensional assessment of the learning curve for the RRC surgical procedure. Intraoperative, postoperative and pathological outcomes were compared among the learning curve phases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Based on the CUSUM and RA-CUSUM analyses, the learning curve for RRC could be divided into 3 different phases: phase 1, the initial learning period (1st-44th case); phase 2, the consolidation period (45th-90th case); and phase 3, the mastery period (91th-108th case). Operation time, conversion to open surgery rate and the number of harvested lymph nodes significantly improve through the three learning phases.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The learning curve for oncological RRC with intracorporeal anastomosis is composed of 3 phases. Our data indicate that the performance of RRC is safe from an oncological point of view in all of the three phases of the learning curve. However, the technical skills necessary to significantly reduce operative time, conversion to open surgery rate and to significantly improve the number of harvested lymph nodes were achieved after 44 procedures. These data suggest that it might be prudent to start the RRC learning curve by treating only benign diseases and to reserve the performance of oncological resection to when at least the initial learning phase has been completed.",3
729,Outcome of TORS to tongue base and epiglottis in patients with OSA intolerant of conventional treatment,"Purpose:
        
      
      Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) of the tongue base with or without epiglottoplasty represents a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of TORS of the tongue base with or without epiglottoplasty in patients who had not tolerated or complied with conventional treatment (continuous positive airway pressure or oral appliance).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Four-year prospective case series. The primary outcome measure was the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in combination with the Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS). Mean oxygen saturation levels (SaO2) before and after TORS on respective sleep studies were also recorded. Secondary outcome measures included operative time and complications. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessed included voice, swallow and quality of life.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Fourteen patients underwent TORS for tongue base reduction with ten having additional wedge epiglottoplasty. A 64 % success rate was achieved with a normal post-operative sleep study in 36 % of cases at 6 months. There was a 51 % reduction in the mean AHI (36.3 ± 21.4 to 21.2 ± 24.6, p = 0.02) and a sustained reduction in the mean Epworth Sleepiness Score (p = 0.002). Mean SaO2 significantly increased after surgery compared to pre-operative values (92.9 ± 1.8 to 94.3 ± 2.5, p = 0.005). Quality of life showed a sustained improvement 3 months following surgery (p = 0.01). No major complications occurred.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      TORS of the tongue base with or without epiglottoplasty represents a promising treatment option with minimal morbidity for selected patients with OSA. Long-term prospective comparative evaluation is necessary to validate the findings of this study.",1
730,The Diamond Light Source and the challenges ahead for structural biology: some informal remarks,"The remarkable advances in structural biology in the past three decades have led to the determination of increasingly complex structures that lie at the heart of many important biological processes. Many of these advances have been made possible by the use of X-ray crystallography using synchrotron radiation. In this short article, some of the challenges and prospects that lie ahead will be summarized.",0
731,"Experiences of a ""COVID protected"" robotic surgical centre for colorectal and urological cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic","The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of elective surgery across the United Kingdom. Re-establishing elective surgery in a manner that ensures patient and staff safety has been a priority. We report our experience and patient outcomes from setting up a ""COVID protected"" robotic unit for colorectal and renal surgery that housed both the da Vinci Si (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the Versius (CMR Surgical, Cambridge, UK) robotic systems. ""COVID protected"" robotic surgery was undertaken in a day-surgical unit attached to the main hospital. A standard operating procedure was developed in collaboration with the trust COVID-19 leadership team and adapted to national recommendations. 60 patients underwent elective robotic surgery in the initial 10-weeks of the study. This included 10 colorectal procedures and 50 urology procedures. Median length of stay was 4 days for rectal cancer procedures, 2 days less than prior to the COVID period, and 1 day for renal procedures. There were no instances of in-patient coronavirus transmission. Six rectal cancer patients waited more than 62 days for their surgery because of the initial COVID peak but none had an increase T-stage between pre-operative staging and post-operative histology. Robotic surgery can be undertaken in ""COVID protected"" units within acute hospitals in a safe way that mitigates the increased risk of undergoing major surgery in the current pandemic. Some benefits were seen such as reduced length of stay for colorectal patients that may be associated with having a dedicated unit for elective robotic surgical services.",3
732,Terrain Classification From Body-Mounted Cameras During Human Locomotion,"This paper presents a novel algorithm for terrain type classification based on monocular video captured from the viewpoint of human locomotion. A texture-based algorithm is developed to classify the path ahead into multiple groups that can be used to support terrain classification. Gait is taken into account in two ways. Firstly, for key frame selection, when regions with homogeneous texture characteristics are updated, the frequency variations of the textured surface are analyzed and used to adaptively define filter coefficients. Secondly, it is incorporated in the parameter estimation process where probabilities of path consistency are employed to improve terrain-type estimation. When tested with multiple classes that directly affect mobility-a hard surface, a soft surface, and an unwalkable area-our proposed method outperforms existing methods by up to 16%, and also provides improved robustness.",0
733,Indocyanine green colonic perfusion demonstration following robotic da Vinci X inferior mesenteric artery ligation for the treatment of type II endoleak,"Background:
        
      
      We describe the technical operative details of the robotic repair of a type II endoleak (T2E) following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). We demonstrate that indocyanine green (ICG) can be used intra-operatively to demonstrate perfusion of the colon following ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) vessel feeding the aneurysm sac.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 74-year old male underwent EVAR for a 5.8 cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm using an E-Tegra, Jotec Device (JOTEC Gmb, Lotzenäcker 23,D-72379 Hechingen). Surveillance contrast CT (CTA) over the ensuing 30 months confirmed progressive sac expansion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ICG confirmed colonic perfusion via the marginals after IMA ligation. Total operative time 56 min < 50 mls blood loss and 1-day hospital stay. 3-month follow-up: CTA and ultrasound demonstrated complete resolution of T2E and adequately perfused colon.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A total robotic approach can be performed safely with intra-operative ICG used to demonstrate colonic perfusion as an added safety measure.",1
734,Negating the fulcrum effect in manual laparoscopic surgery: Investigating skill acquisition with a haptic simulator,"Background:
        
      
      Manual laparoscopic surgery requires extensive training and familiarization. It has been suggested that motion inversion caused by the 'fulcrum effect' is key to motor challenges. We investigate the potential of a conceptual semi-robotic handheld tool that negates natural inversion.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A custom laparoscopic simulator with haptic feedback was developed to allow interactive evaluation of the conceptual tool via virtual prototyping, prior to fabricating a physical prototype. Two groups of eight participants each used either the conceptual or a regular virtual tool over a ten week study to complete two abstract tasks of motor control and force regulation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Statistically significant higher rates of skill improvement were demonstrated with the conceptual tool for motion efficiency, task completion time and error reduction. Force regulation increased for both groups but without significant differences.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results indicate potential for fulcrum-negating hand tools in reducing the time needed to acquire motor skills.",6
735,Robotic oncologic colorectal surgery with a new robotic platform (CMR Versius): hope or hype? A preliminary experience from a full-robotic case-series,"Background:
        
      
      The present case-series describes the first full-robotic colorectal resections performed with the new CMR Versius platform (Cambridge Medical Robotics Surgical, 1 Evolution Business Park, Cambridge, United Kingdom) by an experienced robotic surgeon.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a period between July 2020 and December 2020, patients aged 18 years or older, who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer and were fit for minimally invasive surgery, underwent robotic colorectal resection with CMR Versius robotic platform at ""Casa di Cura Cobellis"" in Vallo della Lucania,Salerno, Italy. Three right colectomies, 2 sigmoid colectomies and 1 anterior rectal resection were performed. All the procedures were planned as fully robotic. Surgical data were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively collected database.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four patients were male and 2 patients were female with a median (range) age of 66 (47-72) years. One covering ileostomy was created. Full robotic splenic flexure mobilization was performed. No additional laparoscopic gestures or procedures were performed in this series except for clipping and stapling which were performed by the assistant surgeon due to the absence of robotic dedicated instruments. Two ileocolic anastomoses, planned as robotic-sewn, were performed extracorporeally. One Clavien-Dindo II complication occurred due to a postoperative blood transfusion. Median total operative time was 160 (145-294) min for right colectomies, 246 (191-300) min for sigmoid colectomies and 250 min for the anterior rectal resection.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present series confirms the feasibility of full-robotic colorectal resections while highlighting the strengths and the limitations of the CMR Versius platform in colorectal surgery. New devices will need more clinical development to be comparable to the current standard.",3
736,Impact of Robotic Surgery on Decision Making: Perspectives of Surgical Teams,"There has been rapid growth in the purchase of surgical robots in both North America and Europe in recent years. Whilst this technology promises many benefits for patients, the introduction of such a complex interactive system into healthcare practice often results in unintended consequences that are difficult to predict. Decision making by surgeons during an operation is affected by variables including tactile perception, visual perception, motor skill, and instrument complexity, all of which are changed by robotic surgery, yet the impact of robotic surgery on decision making has not been previously studied. Drawing on the approach of realist evaluation, we conducted a multi-site interview study across nine hospitals, interviewing 44 operating room personnel with experience of robotic surgery to gather their perspectives on how robotic surgery impacts surgeon decision making. The findings reveal both potential benefits and challenges of robotic surgery for decision making.",3
737,European Society of Coloproctology Colorectal Robotic Surgery Training for the Trainers Course - the first pilot experience,"Aim:
        
      
      Currently, there is no established colorectal specific robotic surgery Train the Trainer (TTT) course. The aim was to develop and evaluate such a course which can then be further developed to be incorporated within the planned European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP)/European School of Coloproctology (ESC) robotic colorectal surgery training curriculum.
    


          Method:
        
      
      After identifying the need for such a course within a training programme, the course was developed by a subgroup of the ESCP/ESC. A scoping literature review was performed and the content and materials for the course were developed by a team consisting of two gastroenterologists with a combined experience of 30 years of facilitating TTT courses, a robotic surgeon and proctor with laparoscopic TTT faculty experience and experienced robotic and laparoscopic colorectal trainers. The course was evaluated by asking delegates to complete pre- and post-course questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were eight delegates on the course from across Europe. Delegates increased their knowledge of each of the course learning objectives and identified learning points in order to change practice. The feedback from the delegates of the course was positive across several areas and all felt that they had achieved their own personal objectives in attending the course.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This pilot robotic colorectal TTT course has achieved its aim and demonstrated many positives. There is a need for such a course and the evaluation processes have provided opportunities for reflection, which will allow the development/tailoring of future robotic colorectal TTT courses to help develop robotic training further.",3
738,Urogenital function in robotic vs laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery: a comparative study,"Purpose:
        
      
      Urological and sexual dysfunction are recognised risks of rectal cancer surgery; however, there is limited evidence regarding urogenital function comparing robotic to laparoscopic techniques. The aim of this study was to assess the urogenital functional outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic rectal cancer surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Urological and sexual functions were assessed using gender-specific validated standardised questionnaires. Questionnaires were sent a minimum of 6 months after surgery, and patients were asked to report their urogenital function pre- and post-operatively, allowing changes in urogenital function to be identified. Questionnaires were sent to 158 patients (89 laparoscopy, 69 robotic) of whom 126 (80 %) responded. Seventy-eight (49 male, 29 female) of the responders underwent laparoscopic and 48 (35 male, 13 female) robotic surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Male patients in the robotic group deteriorated less across all components of sexual function and in five components of urological function. Composite male urological and sexual function score changes from baseline were better in the robotic cohort (p < 0.001). In females, there was no difference between the two groups in any of the components of urological or sexual function. However, composite female urological function score change from baseline was better in the robotic group (p = 0.003).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic rectal cancer surgery might offer better post-operative urological and sexual outcomes compared to laparoscopic surgery in male patients and better urological outcomes in females. Larger scale, prospective randomised control studies including urodynamic assessment of urogenital function are required to validate these results.",2
739,Enablers and barriers to the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots in health and social care: a systematic review,"Objectives:
        
      
      Socially assistive humanoid robots are considered a promising technology to tackle the challenges in health and social care posed by the growth of the ageing population. The purpose of our study was to explore the current evidence on barriers and enablers for the implementation of humanoid robots in health and social care.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Systematic review of studies entailing hands-on interactions with a humanoid robot.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      From April 2018 to June 2018, databases were searched using a combination of the same search terms for articles published during the last decade. Data collection was conducted by using the Rayyan software, a standardised predefined grid, and a risk of bias and a quality assessment tool.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Post-experimental data were collected and analysed for a total of 420 participants. Participants comprised: older adults (n=307) aged ≥60 years, with no or some degree of age-related cognitive impairment, residing either in residential care facilities or at their home; care home staff (n=106); and informal caregivers (n=7).
    


          Primary outcomes:
        
      
      Identification of enablers and barriers to the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots in health and social care, and consequent insights and impact. Future developments to inform further research.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. None of the selected studies had an experimental design; hence overall quality was low, with high risks of biases. Several studies had no comparator, no baseline, small samples, and self-reported measures only. Within this limited evidence base, the enablers found were enjoyment, usability, personalisation and familiarisation. Barriers were related to technical problems, to the robots' limited capabilities and the negative preconceptions towards the use of robots in healthcare. Factors which produced mixed results were the robot's human-like attributes, previous experience with technology and views of formal and informal carers.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The available evidence related to implementation factors of socially assistive humanoid robots for older adults is limited, mainly focusing on aspects at individual level, and exploring acceptance of this technology. Investigation of elements linked to the environment, organisation, societal and cultural milieu, policy and legal framework is necessary.

740,Robotic vs. Laparoscopic Splenectomy in Management of Non-traumatic Splenic Pathologies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"We aimed to evaluate comparative outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic splenectomy in patients with non-traumatic splenic pathologies. A systematic search of electronic databases and bibliographic reference lists were conducted, and a combination of free text and controlled vocabulary search adapted to thesaurus headings, search operators and limits in electronic databases were applied. Intraoperative and post-operative complications, wound infection, haematoma, conversion to open procedure, return to theatre, volume of blood loss, procedure time and length of hospital stay were the evaluated outcome parameters. We identified 8 comparative studies reporting a total of 560 patients comparing outcomes of robotic (n = 202) and laparoscopic (n = 258) splenectomies. The robotic approach was associated with significantly lower volume of blood loss (MD: -82.53 mls, 95% CI -161.91 to -3.16, P = .04) than the laparoscopic approach. There was no significant difference in intraoperative complications (OR: 0.68, 95% CI .21-2.01, P = .51), post-operative complications (OR: .91, 95% CI .40-2.06, P = .82), wound infection (RD: -.01, 95% CI -.04-.03, P = .78), haematoma (OR: 0.40, 95% CI .04-4.03, P = .44), conversion to open (OR: 0.63; 95% CI, .24-1.70, P = .36), return to theatre (RD: -.04, 95% CI -.09-.02, P = .16), procedure time (MD: 3.63; 95% CI -16.99-24.25, P = .73) and length of hospital stay (MD: -.21; 95% CI -1.17 - .75, P = .67) between 2 groups. In conclusion, robotic and laparoscopic splenectomies seem to have comparable perioperative outcomes with similar rate of conversion to an open procedure, procedure time and length of hospital stay. The former may potentially reduce the volume of intraoperative blood loss. Future higher level research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes.",5
741,Robotic total pelvic exenteration for rectal cancer: case report and review of literature,"We describe a case report of a robotic total pelvic exenteration (TPE) performed for a locally advanced rectal cancer at our institution in August 2018. Technical details and comparison with published literature are discussed. A 62-year-old patient with a locally advanced low rectal cancer T4N1cM0 with extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) underwent an elective robotic pelvic clearance performed by the urology and colorectal teams. He received neoadjuvant long-course chemo-radiotherapy to downstage the rectal cancer. The primary tumour was T4N1c with involvement of the bladder (trigone area) and prostate. After neoadjuvant therapy, MRI scan showed tumour regression grade 4 (TRG4). The patient underwent single docking totally robotic pelvic clearance. Patient's body mass index (BMI) was 32. The operative time was 400 minutes with the docking time of 15 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications, and the blood loss was 100ml. Histology was ypT4b, ypN1b, ypMx with 2/9 positive lymph nodes, and there was a complete resection by >1mm at all margins. The postoperative complications were ileus and urinary tract infection. Length of stay was 11 days complicated by prolonged ileus requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The 30-day follow-up had no postoperative complications or readmission. The robotic approach is safe and feasible for multiorgan resections for locally advanced pelvic cancers, with curative intent. The literature supports it by highlighting the advantages of robotic pelvic surgery: better access, stable platform, quick inter-specialty change of operator by use of dual console and superior visualisation.",3
742,An exploration of physiotherapists' experiences of robotic therapy in upper limb rehabilitation within a stroke rehabilitation centre,"Purpose:
        
      
      Strokes are the world's leading cause of adult disability, with movement impairment being more common in the upper limb (UL). Robotic therapy (RT) is identified as an effective adjunct to promote movement but with limited effect on functional capabilities. There is currently limited research in user experience of RT, specifically that of physiotherapists. This study sought to explore physiotherapists' experience of using RT in rehabilitation of the UL, within a stroke rehabilitation centre in the north of England.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Physiotherapists (n = 6) shared their experiences of working with the InMotion2 robot through semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was employed to interpret data, identify emergent themes and interdependent relationships between them.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Five interdependent themes were identified focused around individualized care, influenced by evidence for practice, human relationships, skill mix, and resources and resource management. All physiotherapists valued the use of RT as an adjunct to conventional therapy, although barriers to successful implementation seemed to dominate the views of some.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RT was perceived positively by physiotherapists, regarded as an adjunct to conventional therapy. A framework to summarize the relationships of participants' views and experiences is proposed in an attempt to understand the influences on the clinical use of RT. Implications for Rehabilitation Robotic therapy (RT) is valued as an adjunct to (conventional) person-centred rehabilitation. Resource management and skill mix are viewed as two key challenges to the successful implementation of RT. The production of evidence-based guidelines would be a useful development in the advancement.",6
743,Do People Favor Artificial Intelligence Over Physicians? A Survey Among the General Population and Their View on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,"Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate the general population's view on artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine with specific emphasis on 3 areas that have experienced major progress in AI research in the past few years, namely radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      For this prospective study, the April 2020 Online Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Panel Wave was used. Of the 3117 Longitudinal Internet Studies For The Social Sciences panel members contacted, 2411 completed the full questionnaire (77.4% response rate), after combining data from earlier waves, the final sample size was 1909. A total of 3 scales focusing on trust in the implementation of AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology were used. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance was used for comparison.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The overall means show that respondents have slightly more trust in AI in dermatology than in radiology and surgery. The means show that higher educated males, employed or student, of Western background, and those not admitted to a hospital in the past 12 months have more trust in AI. The trust in AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology is positively associated with belief in the efficiency of AI and these specific domains were negatively associated with distrust and accountability in AI in general.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The general population is more distrustful of AI in medicine unlike the overall optimistic views posed in the media. The level of trust is dependent on what medical area is subject to scrutiny. Certain demographic characteristics and individuals with a generally positive view on AI and its efficiency are significantly associated with higher levels of trust in AI.",2
744,Major colorectal resection is feasible using a new robotic surgical platform: the first report of a case series,"Background:
        
      
      The number of abdominal procedures performed via a robotic-assisted approach is increasing as potential advantages of the modality are recognised. We report the first in human case series of major colorectal resection performed using a new system, Versius®, and assess the feasibility of its use.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The initial cases performed using Versius® at a single centre in the UK were included in the study. Anonymised data were prospectively collected including patient demographics, operative details and postoperative outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-three operations were performed, including left (n = 14) and right (n = 9)-sided colonic resections. Rectal mobilisation was performed in 13. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were male, with a malignant indication for surgery in 70% of cases. Overall mean age was 59.1 ± 15.3 (range 23-89) years. Overall mean body mass index was 28.9 ± 5.2 with a mean of 31.3 ± 4.5 for left-sided resections. The median console operating time was 166 min (range 75-320 min). All malignant cases had negative resection margins and the mean lymph node yield was 18 (SD 9.4). Only one operation (4%) was converted from robotic to open approach. Postoperative length of stay was a median of 5 days (range 3-34 days) and there were no readmissions within 30 days.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results compare favourably with the literature on existing robotic systems and also conventional laparoscopic surgery; hence, we believe that this series indicates the Versius® system is feasible for use in major colorectal resection. These early results from a robot-naïve centre show exciting promise for an expanding robotic market and highlight the need for further evaluation.",9
745,Three-step standardized approach for complete mobilization of the splenic flexure during robotic rectal cancer surgery,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this technical note is to describe a three-step technique for expeditious and complete mobilization of the splenic flexure (CMSF) during single docking totally robotic rectal cancer surgery.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A prospectively maintained database was searched for all patients who underwent single docking totally robotic rectal cancer surgery with CMSF through a stepwise technique.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We studied 89 patients underwent CMSF during single docking totally robotic lower anterior resection for rectal cancer.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The technique demonstrates that CMSF can be performed with a standardized approach using the natural embryological planes of surgery. Moreover, this technique does not involve any change in patient's position on the operating table or undocking the robotic system. We have included an intra-operative video recording to demonstrate the technique.",3
746,The temporal evolution of feedback gains rapidly update to task demands,"Recent theoretical frameworks such as optimal feedback control suggest that feedback gains should modulate throughout a movement and be tuned to task demands. Here we measured the visuomotor feedback gain throughout the course of movements made to ""near"" or ""far"" targets in human subjects. The visuomotor gain showed a systematic modulation over the time course of the reach, with the gain peaking at the middle of the movement and dropping rapidly as the target is approached. This modulation depends primarily on the proportion of the movement remaining, rather than hand position, suggesting that the modulation is sensitive to task demands. Model-predictive control suggests that the gains should be continuously recomputed throughout a movement. To test this, we investigated whether feedback gains update when the task goal is altered during a movement, that is when the target of the reach jumped. We measured the visuomotor gain either simultaneously with the jump or 100 ms after the jump. The visuomotor gain nonspecifically reduced for all target jumps when measured synchronously with the jump. However, the visuomotor gain 100 ms later showed an appropriate modulation for the revised task goal by increasing for jumps that increased the distance to the target and reducing for jumps that decreased the distance. We conclude that visuomotor feedback gain shows a temporal evolution related to task demands and that this evolution can be flexibly recomputed within 100 ms to accommodate online modifications to task goals.",6
747,The impact of COVID-19 on surgical volume and surgical training at a high-volume pelvic oncology centre,"Introduction:
        
      
      The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed most health services. As a result, many surgeries have been deferred and diagnoses delayed. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic at a high-volume pelvic oncology centre.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective review was performed of clinical activity from 2017 to 2020. We compared caseload for index procedures 2017-2019 (period 1) versus 2020 (period 2) to see the effect of the COVID pandemic. We then compared the activity during the first lockdown (March 23rd) to the rest of the year when we increased our theatre access by utilising a 'clean' site.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The average annual number of robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed during period 1 was 82 and 352 respectively. This reduced to 68 (17.1% reduction) and 262 (25.6% reduction) during period 2. The number of patients who underwent prostate brachytherapy decreased from 308 to 243 (21% reduction). The number of prostate biopsies decreased from 420 to 234 (44.3% reduction). The number of radical orchidectomies decreased from 18 to 11 (39% reduction). The mean number of RARC and RARP per month during period 2 was 5.5 and 22. This decreased to 4 and 9 per month during the first national lockdown but was maintained thereafter despite two further lockdowns.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There has been a substantial decrease in urological oncology caseload during the COVID pandemic. The use of alternate pathways such as 'clean' sites can ensure continuity of care for cancer surgery and training needs.",2
748,Long-term prospective evaluation comparing robotic parathyroidectomy with minimally invasive open parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism,"Background:
        
      
      Targeted parathyroidectomy is a popular technique for localized pathology. No single technique is established as superior. The purpose of this study was to compare robotic-assisted parathyroidectomy (RAP) with the most common approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a prospective, nonrandomized study. Fifteen consecutive patients who underwent RAP were compared to 15 matched controls undergoing focused lateral parathyroidectomy (FLP).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Biochemical cure occurred in 29 of 30 patients (97%). No major complications occurred, although there was 1 robotic conversion. RAP demonstrated a significant time reduction (R(2) = 0.436; p = .01) but took much longer to perform than FLP (119 minutes vs 34 minutes; p = .001). RAP was associated with less initial postoperative pain (p = .036) and higher satisfaction with scar cosmesis (p = .002) until 6 months. Quality of life (QOL) improved in both groups (p = .007).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RAP provides superior early cosmesis with equivalent global health improvement compared to FLP. The high cost and learning curve may preclude widespread adoption. Further evaluation is necessary to establish its clinical efficacy regarding scar cosmesis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E300-E7, 2016.",1
749,Outreach and Influence of Surgical Societies' Recommendations on Minimally Invasive Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic-An Anonymized International Urologic Expert Inquiry,"Objective:
        
      
      To assess the outreach and influence of the main recommendations of surgical governing bodies on adaptation of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery (MIS) procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in an anonymized multi-institutional survey.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      International experts performing MIS were selected on the basis of the contact database of the speakers of the Friends of Israel Urology Symposium. A 24-item questionnaire was built using main recommendations of surgical societies. Total cases/1 Mio residents as well as absolute number of total cases were utilized as surrogates for the national disease burden. Statistics and plots were performed using RStudio v0.98.953.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-two complete questionnaires from individual centers performing MIS were received. The study demonstrated that most centers were aware of and adapted their MIS management to the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance to surgical bodies' recommendations. Hospitals from the countries with a high disease burden put these adoptions more often into practice than the others particularly regarding swabs as well as CO2 insufflation and specimen extraction procedures. Twelve respondents reported on presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission during MIS generating hypothesis for further research.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Guidelines of surgical governing bodies on adaptation of MIS during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate significant outreach and implementation, whereas centers from the countries with a high disease burden are more often poised to modify their practice. Rapid publication and distribution of such recommendation is crucial during future epidemic threats.",3
750,Mapping upper-limb motor performance after stroke - a novel method with utility for individualized motor training,"Background:
        
      
      Chronic upper limb motor impairment is a common outcome of stroke. Therapeutic training can reduce motor impairment. Recently, a growing interest in evaluating motor training provided by robotic assistive devices has emerged. Robot-assisted therapy is attractive because it provides a means of increasing practice intensity without increasing the workload of physical therapists. However, movements practised through robotic assistive devices are commonly pre-defined and fixed across individuals. More optimal training may result from individualizing the selection of the trained movements based on the individual's impairment profile. This requires quantitative assessment of the degree of the motor impairment prior to training, in relevant movement tasks. However, standard clinical measures for profiling motor impairment after stroke are often subjective and lack precision. We have developed a novel robot-mediated method for systematic and fine-grained mapping (or profiling) of individual performance across a wide range of planar arm reaching movements. Here we describe and demonstrate this mapping method and its utilization for individualized training. We also present a novel principle for the individualized selection of training movements based on the performance maps.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      To demonstrate the utility of our method we present examples of 2D performance maps produced from the kinetic and kinematics data of two individuals with stroke-related upper limb hemiparesis. The maps outline distinct regions of high motor impairment. The procedure of map-based selection of training movements and the change in motor performance following training is demonstrated for one participant.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The performance mapping method is feasible to produce (online or offline). The 2D maps are easy to interpret and to be utilized for selecting individual performance-based training. Different performance maps can be easily compared within and between individuals, which potentially has diagnostic utility.",0
751,Grey-box modelling and fuzzy logic control of a Leader-Follower robot manipulator system: A hybrid Grey Wolf-Whale Optimisation approach,"This study presents the development of a grey-box modelling approach and fuzzy logic control for real time trajectory control of an experimental four degree-of-freedom Leader-Follower​ Robot (LFR) manipulator system using a hybrid optimisation algorithm, known as Grey Wolf Optimiser (GWO) - Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA). The approach has advantages in achieving an accurate model of the LFR manipulator system, and together with a better trajectory tracking performance. In the first instance, the white box model is formed by modelling the dynamics of the follower manipulator using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. This white-box model is then improved upon by re-tuning the model's parameters using GWO-WOA and experimental data from the real LFR manipulator system, thus forming the grey-box model. A minimum improvement of 73.9% is achieved by the grey-box model in comparison to the white-box model. In the latter part of this investigation, the developed grey-box model is used for the design, tuning and real-time implementation of a fuzzy PD＋I controller on the experimental LFR manipulator system. A 78% improvement in the total mean squared error is realised after tuning the membership functions of the fuzzy logic controller using GWO-WOA. Experimental results show that the approach significantly improves the trajectory tracking performance of the LFR manipulator system in terms of mean squared error, steady state error and time delay.",4
752,Determinants of Patient Mobility for Prostate Cancer Surgery: A Population-based Study of Choice and Competition,"Many countries have introduced policies that enable patients to select a health care provider of their choice with the aim of improving the quality of care. However, there is little information about the drivers or the impact of patient mobility. Using administrative hospital data (n=19256) we analysed the mobility of prostate cancer patients who had radical surgery in England between 2010 and 2014. Our analysis, using geographic information systems and multivariable choice modelling, found that 33·5% (n=6465) of men bypassed their nearest prostate cancer surgical centre. Travel time had a strong impact on where patients moved to but was less of a factor for men who were younger, fitter, and more affluent (p always < 0.001). Men were more likely to move to hospitals that provided robotic prostate cancer surgery (odds ratio: 1.42, p<0.001) and to hospitals that employed surgeons with a strong media reputation (odds ratio: 2.18, p<0.001). Patient mobility occurred in the absence of validated measures of the quality of care, instead influenced by the adoption of robotic surgery and the reputation of individual clinicians. National policy based on patient choice and provider competition may have had a negative impact on equality of access, service capacity, and health system efficiency.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this study, we assessed the reasons why men would choose to have prostate cancer surgery at a centre other than their nearest. We found that in England men were attracted to centres that carried out robotic surgery and employed surgeons with a national reputation.",3
753,Assessment of pose repeatability and specimen repositioning of a robotic joint testing platform,"This paper describes the quantitative assessment of a robotic testing platform, consisting of an industrial robot and a universal force-moment sensor, via the design of fixtures used to hold the tibia and femur of cadaveric knees. This platform was used to study the contributions of different soft tissues and the ability of implants and reconstruction surgeries to restore normal joint functions, in previously published literature. To compare different conditions of human joints, it is essential to reposition specimens with high precision after they have been removed for a surgical procedure. Methods and experiments carried out to determine the pose repeatability and measure errors in repositioning specimens are presented. This was achieved using an optical tracking system (fusion Track 500, Atracsys Switzerland) to measure the position and orientation of bespoke rigid body markers attached to the tibial and femoral pots after removing and reinstalling them inside the rigs. The pose repeatability was then evaluated by controlling the robotic platform to move a knee joint repeatedly to/from a given pose while tracking the position and orientation of a rigid body marker attached to the tibial fixture. The results showed that the proposed design ensured a high repeatability in repositioning the pots with standard deviations for the computed distance and angle between the pots at both ends of the joint equal to 0.1mm, 0.01mm, 0.13° and 0.03° for the tibial and femoral fixtures respectively. Therefore, it is possible to remove and re-setup a joint with high precision. The results also showed that the errors in repositioning the robotic platform (that is: specimen path repeatability) were 0.11mm and 0.12°, respectively.",1
754,Minimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy (LEOPARD): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Observational cohort studies have suggested that minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) is associated with better short-term outcomes compared with open distal pancreatectomy (ODP), such as less intraoperative blood loss, lower morbidity, shorter length of hospital stay, and reduced total costs. Confounding by indication has probably influenced these findings, given that case-matched studies failed to confirm the superiority of MIDP. This accentuates the need for multicenter randomized controlled trials, which are currently lacking. We hypothesize that time to functional recovery is shorter after MIDP compared with ODP even in an enhanced recovery setting.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      LEOPARD is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, patient-blinded, multicenter, superiority trial in all 17 centers of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group. A total of 102 patients with symptomatic benign, premalignant or malignant disease will be randomly allocated to undergo MIDP or ODP in an enhanced recovery setting. The primary outcome is time (days) to functional recovery, defined as all of the following: independently mobile at the preoperative level, sufficient pain control with oral medication alone, ability to maintain sufficient (i.e. >50%) daily required caloric intake, no intravenous fluid administration and no signs of infection. Secondary outcomes are operative and postoperative outcomes, including clinically relevant complications, mortality, quality of life and costs.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The LEOPARD trial is designed to investigate whether MIDP reduces the time to functional recovery compared with ODP in an enhanced recovery setting.

755,"Surgical robotics through a keyhole: from today's translational barriers to tomorrow's ""disappearing"" robots","In the last century, engineering advances have transformed the practice of surgery. Keyhole surgical techniques offer a number of advantages over traditional open approaches including less postoperative pain, fewer wound complications, and reduced length of stay in hospital. However, they also present considerable technical challenges, particularly to surgeons performing new operative approaches, such as those through natural orifices. Advances in surgical robots have improved surgical visualization, dexterity, and manipulation consistency, thus greatly enhancing surgical performance and patient care. Clinically, however, robotic surgery is still in its infancy, and its use has remained limited to relatively few operations. In the paper, we will discuss the economic-, clinical-, and research-related factors that may act as barriers to the widespread utilization and development of surgical robots. In overcoming these barriers through a synergistic effort of both engineering and medicine, we highlight our future vision of robotic surgery, in both the short and long term.",1
756,Making the Jump: A Qualitative Analysis on the Transition From Bedside Assistant to Console Surgeon in Robotic Surgery Training,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine barriers associated with the transition from bedside assistant to console surgeon for general surgery residents in the era of robotic surgery in general surgery training.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Qualitative thematic analysis using one-on-one interviews of general surgery residents and attendings conducted between June 2018 and February 2019.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      An urban, academic, multihospital general surgery residency program with a robust robotic surgery program.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Convenient and purposeful sampling was performed to ensure a variety of resident graduate-years and attending subspecialties were represented. Sample size was determined by data saturation, which occurred after 20 resident and 7 attending interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Residents identified the low volume of general surgery robotic cases, the infrequency of exposure to robotic surgery, and attending comfort with robotic surgery (and with teaching on the robot) as potential barriers in the transition from bedside assistant to console surgeon. Residents had to find a replacement bedside assistant in order to be the console surgeon, which was challenging. In addition, residents felt that the current culture surrounding robotic surgery is very hierarchal, limiting their exposure. Attendings' trust in the residents' console skills was a major determining factor in allowing residents on the console.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most robotic surgery education curricula are sequential, requiring the resident to progress from bedside assistant to console surgeon. Unfortunately, there are many potential barriers for residents in the transition from bedside assistant to console surgeon. Some barriers apply to general surgery training overall, but are amplified in robotic surgery, while others are unique to robotic surgery education. Recognition of, and rectifying, these barriers may increase resident participation as the console surgeon.",3
757,"Transoral robotic surgery for the benefit of patients with head and neck cancer of unknown primary: our experience at St George's University Hospital, London","Introduction:
        
      
      Head and neck carcinoma of unknown primary represents 1-5% of all head and neck cancers and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. In approximately 40% of cases, a primary tumour location remains unknown despite investigation. With advancements in our understanding of the role of high-risk human papilloma virus in head and neck cancer, transoral robotic surgery presents an option for diagnosis and therapy.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This is a retrospective case series from a single centre. Case notes were reviewed for 28 patients who had transoral robotic surgery for head and neck carcinoma of unknown primary between May 2015 and July 2019.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Transoral robotic surgery identified an oropharyngeal primary tumour in 19 of 28 (67.8%) patients. All oropharyngeal primaries were p16 positive. The base of tongue identification rate was 63.2%. Median length of inpatient stay postoperatively was 1.0 day. Normal oral intake resumed within 48 hours in 96% (27/28) of patients. Three patients (10.3%) suffered minor postoperative bleeds that were all managed conservatively.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The base of tongue primary identification rate (63.2%) in this series is consistent with that previously reported (43-63%; 95% confidence interval). Primary tumour identification rate if a patient is p16 positive is 86.3% (19/22), with 100% of these being oropharyngeal. We suggest future investigation into p16 status as a means of stratifying patients with head and neck carcinoma of unknown primary for transoral robotic surgery.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Transoral robotic base of tongue mucosectomy (or lingual tonsillectomy) is a promising technique that offers a high yield of positive identification for the primary tumour. It is well tolerated with minimal associated morbidity. Our findings are comparable with those in the current literature.",1
758,Robotic technology results in faster and more robust surgical skill acquisition than traditional laparoscopy,"Technical surgical skills are said to be acquired quicker on a robotic rather than laparoscopic platform. However, research examining this proposition is scarce. Thus, this study aimed to compare the performance and learning curves of novices acquiring skills using a robotic or laparoscopic system, and to examine if any learning advantages were maintained over time and transferred to more difficult and stressful tasks. Forty novice participants were randomly assigned to either a robotic- or laparoscopic-trained group. Following one baseline trial on a ball pick-and-drop task, participants performed 50 learning trials. Participants then completed an immediate retention trial and a transfer trial on a two-instrument rope-threading task. One month later, participants performed a delayed retention trial and a stressful multi-tasking trial. The results revealed that the robotic-trained group completed the ball pick-and-drop task more quickly and accurately than the laparoscopic-trained group across baseline, immediate retention, and delayed retention trials. Furthermore, the robotic-trained group displayed a shorter learning curve for accuracy. The robotic-trained group also performed the more complex rope-threading and stressful multi-tasking transfer trials better. Finally, in the multi-tasking trial, the robotic-trained group made fewer tone counting errors. The results highlight the benefits of using robotic technology for the acquisition of technical surgical skills.",6
759,"Precision in robotic rectal surgery using the da Vinci Xi system and integrated table motion, a technical note","Robotic rectal surgery is becoming increasingly more popular among colorectal surgeons. However, time spent on robotic platform docking, arm clashing and undocking of the platform during the procedure are factors that surgeons often find cumbersome and time consuming. The newest surgical platform, the da Vinci Xi, coupled with integrated table motion can help to overcome these problems. This technical note aims to describe a standardised operative technique of single docking robotic rectal surgery using the da Vinci Xi system and integrated table motion. A stepwise approach of the da Vinci docking process and surgical technique is described accompanied by an intra-operative video that demonstrates this technique. We also present data collected from a prospectively maintained database. 33 consecutive rectal cancer patients (24 male, 9 female) received robotic rectal surgery with the da Vinci Xi during the preparation of this technical note. 29 (88%) patients had anterior resections, and four (12%) had abdominoperineal excisions. There were no conversions, no anastomotic leaks and no mortality. Median operation time was 331 (249-372) min, blood loss 20 (20-45) mls and length of stay 6.5 (4-8) days. 30-day readmission rate and re-operation rates were 3% (n = 1). This standardised technique of single docking robotic rectal surgery with the da Vinci Xi is safe, feasible and reproducible. The technological advances of the new robotic system facilitate the totally robotic single docking approach.",3
760,"Socially assistive robots for people with dementia: Systematic review and meta-analysis of feasibility, acceptability and the effect on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life","Background:
        
      
      There is increasing interest in using robots to support dementia care but little consensus on the evidence for their use. The aim of the study is to review evidence about feasibility, acceptability and clinical effectiveness of socially assistive robots used for people with dementia.
    


          Method:
        
      
      We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINHAL, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and EI Engineering Village from inception to 04 - 02-2022 - included primary studies assessing feasibility, acceptability, or effectiveness of socially assistive robots for people with dementia. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, and assessed quality. Narrative synthesis prioritized higher quality studies, and random-effect meta-analyses compared robots with usual care (UC) or active control (AC) immediately after the intervention (short-term; ST) or long-term (LT) on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      66 studies and four categories of robots were eligible: Companion robots (Pet and humanoid companion robots), telepresence communication robots, homecare assistive robots and multifunctional robots. PARO (companion robot seal) was feasible and acceptable but limited by its weight, cost, and sound. On meta-analysis, PARO had no ST or LT compared to UC or AC over 5-12 weeks on agitation (ST vs UC, 4 trials, 153 participants: pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.25; - 0.57 to 0.06; LT vs UC; 2 trials, 77 participants, SMD = -0.24; - 0.94, 0.46), cognition (ST vs UC, 3 trials, 128 participants: SMD= 0.03; -0.32, 0.38), overall neuropsychiatric symptoms (ST vs UC, 3 trials, 169 participants: SMD= -0.01; -0.32, 0.29; ST vs AC, 2 trials, 145 participants: SMD =0.02, -0.71, 0.85), apathy (ST vs AC, 2 trials, 81 participants: SMD= 0.14; 0.29, 0.58), depression (ST vs UC, 4 trials, 181 participants; SMD= 0.08; -0.52, 0.69; LT vs UC: 2 trials, 77 participants: SMD =0.01; -0.75, 0.77), anxiety (ST vs UC: 2 trials, 104 participants, SMD= 0.24; -0.85, 1.33) and quality of life (ST vs UC, 2 trials, 127 participants: SMD=-0.05; -0.52, 0.42; ST vs AC: 2 trials, 159 participants, SMD =-0.36, -0.76, 0.05). Robotic animals, humanoid companion robots, telepresence robots and multifunctional robots were feasible and acceptable. However, humanoid companion robots have speech recognition problems, and telepresence robots and multifunctional robots were often difficult to use. There was mixed evidence about the feasibility of homecare robots. There was little evidence on any of these robots' effectiveness.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although robots were generally feasible and acceptable, there is no clear evidence that people with dementia derive benefit from robots for cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or quality of life. We recommend that future research should use high quality designs to establish evidence of effectiveness.",2
761,"Mitral isthmus ablation is feasible, efficacious, and safe using a remote robotic catheter system","Background:
        
      
      There are limited data on the use of a remote robotic catheter system (RCS) for mitral isthmus (MI) ablation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This single-center, prospective, matched control study included 45 patients who underwent atrial fibrillation ablation using a remote RCS compared to 45 patients who underwent conventional ablation. All patients had circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), roof, and MI ablation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics. There were no significant differences in MI block (RCS: 44/45 [98%] vs
    


          Control:
        
      
      43/45 [96%], P = 1.0), roof block (RCS: 45/45 [100%] vs
    


          Control:

          Control:
        
      
      45/45 [100%], P = 1.0). Ablation and procedural times were similar in both arms. Using RCS, mean total MI ablation and procedure times were 13 ± 6 minutes and 23 ± 15 minutes, respectively. Coronary sinus (CS) ablation was significantly less in the RCS arm (48% vs 72%, P = 0.03). It was possible to ""drive"" the ablation catheter into the distal CS using the RCS in 19/22 (86%) patients. There was a significant trend of reduction in mean MI ablation (P = 0.008) and procedural times (P = 0.004) over the course of the study period. There was a significant reduction in fluoroscopy time in the RNS arm (33 ± 17 minutes vs 49 ± 20 minutes, P = 0.0004).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It is feasible and safe to use a remote RCS for MI ablation, including ""driving into the CS."" MI block was achieved in 98% with a significant reduction in the need for CS ablation (48%). There is a short learning curve.",8
762,Current issues and future considerations for the wider implementation of robotic-assisted surgery: a qualitative study,"Objectives:
        
      
      The effective implementation of a fast-changing healthcare delivery innovation, such as robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), into a healthcare system, can be affected (both positively and negatively) by external contextual factors. As part of a wider project investigating ways to optimise the implementation of RAS, this qualitative study aimed to uncover current issues of RAS and predictions about the future of robotic surgery. We refer to 'current issues' as the topical and salient challenges and opportunities related to the introduction of RAS in the UK healthcare system, from the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in the delivery and implementation of RAS.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted. A thematic analysis was conducted to summarise salient issues that were articulated by the participants.
    


          Setting and participants:
        
      
      The interview sample (n=35) comprised surgeons, wider theatre staff and other relevant personnel involved in the introduction and delivery of RAS services across the UK, including service managers and policymakers/commissioners. Two focus groups were also conducted with surgical trainees (n=7) and members of the public (n=8), respectively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The results revealed a largely positive attitude towards the introduction of RAS technology and an expectation of continued rapid expansion. Areas perceived to be particularly pertinent and requiring ongoing attention were also highlighted, including the need to achieve improved quality control, expertise quantification and training issues and the need to educate the public. Issues of centralisation, service organisation and equity of access were also emphasised.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study has highlighted a range of issues perceived to be particularly pertinent to the current and future provision of RAS which should be addressed. The areas outlined can enable healthcare managers and surgeons to plan for the adoption and/or expansion of RAS services.",3

          Exclusions:
        
      
      patients not consenting to data collection. Data on CPET measures (AT, ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide [VE/VCO2] at AT, peak oxygen uptake [VO2]), and patient demographics prospectively collected. Outcome measurements included hospital LOS; 30-day MAE and 90-day mortality data, which were prospectively recorded. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to assess whether CPET measures were associated with or predicted outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From June 2011 to March 2015, 128 patients underwent radical cystectomy (open cystectomy, n = 17; iRARC, n = 111). A total of 82 patients who underwent iRARC and CPET and consented to participation were included. Median (interquartile range): age = 65 (58-73); body mass index = 27 (23-30); AT = 10.0 (9-11), Peak VO2 = 15.0 (13-18.5), VE/VCO2 (AT) = 33.0 (30-38). 30-day MAE = 14/111 (12.6%): death = 2, multiorgan failure = 2, abscess = 2, gastrointestinal = 2, renal = 6; 90-day mortality = 3/111 (2.7%). AT, peak VO2, and VE/VCO2 (at AT) were not significant predictors of 30-day MAE or LOS. The results are limited by the absence of control group undergoing open surgery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Poor cardiorespiratory fitness does not predict increased hospital LOS or MAEs in patients undergoing iRARC. Overall, MAE and LOS comparable with other series.",2
764,Outcomes after different non-sternotomy approaches to left single-vessel revascularization: a comparative study with up to 10-year follow-up,"Objectives:
        
      
      Various non-sternotomy approaches have been used for left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafting in left single-vessel revascularization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of three different non-sternotomy techniques on long-term outcomes after left single-vessel revascularization.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 502 patients having single-vessel LAD disease treated from April 2003 to May 2013 by minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB), endoscopically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (EACAB) or robotically assisted direct coronary artery bypass grafting (RADCAB) were reviewed. In all cases, distal anastomoses were performed through anterolateral minithoracotomy incisions. In-hospital and long-term (10-year) outcomes were compared using standard and propensity score-adjusted analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One hundred and eighty-nine patients had MIDCAB, 76 had EACAB and 236 had RADCAB. After propensity score matching, RADCAB patients had significantly longer operative duration (P < 0.001), whereas MIDCAB and RADCAB patients had significantly higher incidence of postoperative angina over the follow-up (P = 0.034). The groups were comparable regarding in-hospital mortality and reintervention rate as well as incidence of myocardial infarction, reoperations, reinterventions and cardiac death. All groups showed comparable long-term survival (P = 0.943).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      MIDCAB, EACAB and RADCAB are associated with similar long-term survival and incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in single-vessel surgical revascularization. However, the endoscopic approach was found to be free from the disadvantages of longer operating duration observed in RADCAB or higher incidence of angina and shorter freedom from MACEs observed in both MIDCAB and RADCAB groups.",2
765,Men's experiences of regaining urinary continence following robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) for localised prostate cancer: a qualitative phenomenological study,"Aims and objectives:
        
      
      To understand how men interpret their experiences of regaining continence following robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).
    


          Background:
        
      
      RALP is an innovative surgical technique intended to minimise the risk of long-term postoperative urinary incontinence in localised prostate cancer. Studies have shown that urinary function and quality of life domains can be adversely affected following RALP; however, the impact on men's lives has been hitherto unreported.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A qualitative study using hermeneutic phenomenology
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Face-to-face, in-depth audio-recorded interviews with seven men (aged 57-71) who had recently undergone RALP and defined themselves as continent of urine. Data were inductively analysed for themes using an adapted version of Diekelmann et al. [1989, The NLN Criteria of Appraisal of Baccalaureate Programs: A Critical Hermeneutic Analysis, 1st edn. National League for Nursing (NLN) Press, New York, NY] framework.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Men's experiences of regaining continence were situated within a wider network of personal and social relationships, and cultural structures. Themes included 'what was forecast', 'after-sales service', 'new plumbing', 'sense of self'. Men adopted a variety of practical coping strategies: preventing incontinence; improving incontinence; and dealing with lack of bladder control.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The need to regain a sense of control over their lives resulted in all men developing coping mechanisms in order that they could resume their societal roles, which were salient to their personal identity, inferring that men's ability to cope with incontinence after RALP was dependent on factors other than urinary leakage alone.
    


          Relevance to clinical practice:
        
      
      Knowledge of the potential impact of RALP could help nurses tailor appropriate interventions. Incontinence is individually interpreted and may not be well-addressed by traditional 'one-size fits all' preoperative programmes or information. Flexible and imaginative options (e.g., activity-focused interventions; buddy systems; internet programmes; telephone follow-up) for preoperative and postoperative support and activities for men may improve men's uptake of such services, through specialist nurse or peer support.",2
766,TECLA-an innovative technical approach for prostate cancer registries,"Objective: To present a code-driven, electronic database for patients TrEated with robotic-assisted radiCaL prostAtectomy (TECLA), developed at Innlandet Hospital (IH), Trust, Norway, for research, local quality control and to deliver data to the National Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). Clinical data are directly extracted from the structured documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR).Materials and methods: The urological department at IH treats about 200 patients with robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) annually. All consenting patients registered with the procedure code for RARP are included in TECLA. Clinical data are obtained automatically from the EMR, by structured forms. Patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs and PREMs) are filled in by the patients on an iPad or a smartphone.Results: The basic construct of TECLA is presented. From August 2017 to June 2018, 200 men were treated with RARP, of which 182 (91%) provided consent for inclusion in the register. Of these, 97% completed the PROM survey before treatment and 91% at 3 months follow-up. PREMs were completed by 78%. All clinical variables for the hospital stay and for the 6-week follow-up were more than 95% complete.Conclusion: This entirely electronic surgical quality register is easy to use, both for patients and clinicians, and has a high capture rate. The data collection is linked to the clinicians' workflow, without double data entry, so entering data does not add any extra work. The register design can be used by other hospitals for various surgical procedures.",0
767,The collaborative mind: intention reading and trust in human-robot interaction,"Robots are likely to become important social actors in our future and so require more human-like ways of assisting us. We state that collaboration between humans and robots is fostered by two cognitive skills: intention reading and trust. An agent possessing these abilities would be able to infer the non-verbal intentions of others and to evaluate how likely they are to achieve their goals, jointly understanding what kind and which degree of collaboration they require. For this reason, we propose a developmental artificial cognitive architecture that integrates unsupervised machine learning and probabilistic models to imbue a humanoid robot with intention reading and trusting capabilities. Our experimental results show that the synergistic implementation of these cognitive skills enable the robot to cooperate in a meaningful way, with the intention reading model allowing a correct goal prediction and with the trust component enhancing the likelihood of a positive outcome for the task.",4
768,The Novel and Minimally Invasive Treatment Modalities for Female Pelvic Floor Muscle Dysfunction; Beyond the Traditional,"Pelvic floor dysfunction is a clinical entity that is prevalent among female patients. Determining the exact underlying cause of pelvic floor dysfunction is difficult, and surgical intervention for this clinical entity may be challenging. Pelvic floor dysfunction can affect the quality of life of the patient by causing stress urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, or both. Well-defined surgical treatment options, minimally invasive approaches, and novel techniques for the treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction have been recently introduced. Here, we evaluated the management options available for patients with stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. We searched Medline and EMBASE databases for relevant articles by using the keywords “pelvic floor dysfunction,” “minimally invasive procedures,” “stress urinary incontinence,” “pelvic organ prolapse,” and “novel techniques”. Traditional treatment options for stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are beyond the scope of our review. Laparoscopic and robotic surgical treatments for pelvic floor dysfunction continue to evolve and develop. These minimally invasive techniques will soon replace open procedures. Alternative novel treatment modalities have also been developed from novel human-compatible materials and are emerging as successful treatments for stress urinary incontinence. The development of these various treatment options has implications for future surgical practice in the field of uro-gynecology.",3
769,A phase III randomized clinical trial comparing sentinel node biopsy with no retroperitoneal node dissection in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer - ENDO-3: ANZGOG trial 1911/2020,"Background:
        
      
      Sentinel node biopsy is a surgical technique to explore lymph nodes for surgical staging of endometrial cancer, which has replaced full retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. However, the effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy, its value to patients, and potential harms compared with no-node dissection have never been shown in a randomized trial.
    


          Primary objectives:
        
      
      Stage 1 will test recovery from surgery. Stage 2 will compare disease-free survival at 4.5 years between patients randomized to sentinel node biopsy versus no retroperitoneal node dissection.
    


          Study hypothesis:
        
      
      The primary hypothesis for stage 1 is that treatment with sentinel node biopsy will not cause detriment to patient outcomes (lymphedema, morbidity, loss of quality of life) and will not increase treatment-related morbidity or health services costs compared with patients treated without a retroperitoneal node dissection at 12 months after surgery. The primary hypothesis for stage 2 is that disease-free survival at 4.5 years after surgery in patients without retroperitoneal node dissection is not inferior to those receiving sentinel node biopsy.
    


          Trial design:
        
      
      This phase III, open-label, two-arm, multistage, randomized non-inferiority trial (ENDO-3) will determine the value of sentinel node biopsy for surgical management of endometrial cancer. Patients with endometrial cancer are randomized to receive: (1) laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with sentinel node biopsy or (2) laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without retroperitoneal node dissection. In stage 1, 444 patients will be enrolled to demonstrate feasibility and quality of life. If this is demonstrated, we will enroll another 316 patients in stage 2.
    


          Major inclusion and exclusion criteria:
        
      
      Inclusion criteria include women aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer; clinical stage 1, who meet the criteria for laparoscopic or robotic total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Patients with uterine mesenchymal tumors are excluded.
    


          Primary endpoints:
        
      
      The endpoint for stage 1 is surgical recovery, with the proportion of patients returning to usual daily activities at 3 months post-surgery as measured with the EQ-5D. Stage 2 is disease-free survival at 4.5 years.
    


          Sample size:
        
      
      760 participants (both stages).
    


          Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting results:
        
      
      Stage 1 commenced in January 2021 and is planned to be completed in December 2024 when 444 participants have completed 12 months' follow-up. Stage 2 will enroll a further 316 participants for a total of 760 patients.

770,Trusting Robocop: Gender-Based Effects on Trust of an Autonomous Robot,"Little is known regarding public opinion of autonomous robots. Trust of these robots is a pertinent topic as this construct relates to one's willingness to be vulnerable to such systems. The current research examined gender-based effects of trust in the context of an autonomous security robot. Participants (N = 200; 63% male) viewed a video depicting an autonomous guard robot interacting with humans using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The robot was equipped with a non-lethal device to deter non-authorized visitors and the video depicted the robot using this non-lethal device on one of the three humans in the video. However, the scenario was designed to create uncertainty regarding who was at fault - the robot or the human. Following the video, participants rated their trust in the robot, perceived trustworthiness of the robot, and their desire to utilize similar autonomous robots in several different contexts that varied from military use to commercial use to home use. The results of the study demonstrated that females reported higher trust and perceived trustworthiness of the robot relative to males. Implications for the role of individual differences in trust of robots are discussed.",4
771,Prospective Multicenter Comparison of Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: The PROST-QA/RP2 Consortium,"Purpose:
        
      
      Our goal was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) and open radical prostatectomy (ORP) in a multicenter study.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We evaluated men with localized prostate cancer at 11 high-volume academic medical centers in the United States from the PROST-QA (2003-2006) and the PROST-QA/RP2 cohorts (2010-2013) with a pre-specified goal of comparing RALP (549) and ORP (545). We measured longitudinal patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at pre-treatment and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months, and pathological and perioperative outcomes/complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Demographics, cancer characteristics, and margin status were similar between surgical approaches. ORP subjects were more likely to undergo lymphadenectomy (89% vs 47%; p <0.01) and nerve sparing (94% vs 89%; p <0.01). RALP vs ORP subjects experienced less mean intraoperative blood loss (192 vs 805 mL; p <0.01), shorter mean hospital stay (1.6 vs 2.1 days; p <0.01), and fewer blood transfusions (1% vs 4%; p <0.01), wound infections (2% vs 4%; p=0.02), other infections (1% vs 4%; p <0.01), deep venous thromboses (0.5% vs 2%; p=0.04), and bladder neck contractures requiring dilation (1.6% vs 8.3%; p <0.01). RALP subjects reported less pain (p=0.04), less activity interference (p <0.01) and higher incision satisfaction (p <0.01). Surgical approach (RALP vs ORP) was not a significant predictor of longitudinal HRQOL change in any HRQOL domain.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In high-volume academic centers, RALP and ORP patients may expect similar long-term HRQOL outcomes. Overall, RALP patients have less pain, shorter hospital stays, and fewer post-surgical complications such as blood transfusions, infections, deep venous thromboses, and bladder neck contractures.",2
772,Use of robotic technology in cam femoroacetabular impingement corrective surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Cam type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is an anatomical disorder that can lead to osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip joint. With existing surgical options there is invariably a tendency for under-resection or over-resection of the cam lesion, both having dire consequences. This study assessed the application of robotic technology in the surgical management of cam FAI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three different dry-bone femur models (14 in each) with severe cam deformity underwent corrective surgery using a haptic robot with active constraints. The 'post surgery', models were CT scanned and 3-D alpha angles and head/neck ratios (HNRs) were compared with pre-operative plans.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all models, the robotic resection resulted in a measured reduction of the maximum alpha angle to an angle indicative of no clinical impingement (first model 91° vs 49° ± 3°, second 91° vs 55° ± 5°, and third 87° vs 47° ± 2° P < 0.001). Similarly, the HNRs for all models reduced substantially following resection surgery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This dry bone study validates the use of robotic technology to perform cam FAI corrective surgery. A more accurate bony resection may minimize complications due to over- and under-resection.",1
773,"Long-term Oncological Outcomes from an Early Phase Randomised Controlled Three-arm Trial of Open, Robotic, and Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy (CORAL)","Background:
        
      
      The long-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic (LRC) and robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) are still maturing compared with open radical cystectomy (ORC).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the 5-yr oncological outcomes of patients recruited into the randomised trial of Open, Laparoscopic and Robot Assisted Cystectomy (CORAL) and extracorporeal urinary diversion.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A review of prospectively maintained database of 60 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) or high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (HRNMIBC) who were previously randomised in the CORAL trial to receive ORC, RARC, or LRC. This trial was designed to compare the perioperative and early oncological outcomes of these techniques.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      The outcomes of interest included 5-yr recurrence-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to plot the recurrence and survival data. The curves between RFS, CSS, and OS were compared using the log-rank test. A two-sided p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results were analysed on the basis of intention to treat.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      A total of 60 patients with either MIBC (n=38) or HRNMIBC (n=21) were randomised in the CORAL trial to receive ORC, RARC, or LRC. The 5-yr RFS was 60%, 58%, and 71%; 5-yr CSS was 64%, 68%, and 69%; and 5-yr OS was 55%, 65%, and 61% for ORC, RARC, and LRC, respectively. There was no significant difference in RFS, CSS, and OS between the three surgical arms. The principal limitation is the small sample size.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There was no difference in 5-yr RFS, CSS, and OS rates of patients who underwent ORC, RARC, and LRC for management of bladder cancer. Minimally invasive techniques achieved equivalent oncological outcomes to the gold standard of ORC. However, the study was based at a single institution with a small sample size.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Patients who agreed to participate in the randomised trial of either open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted radical cystectomy for bladder cancer did not have different cancer outcomes at 5yr.",2
774,Ultrasound 3D reconstruction of malignant masses in robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy using the PAF rail system: a comparison study,"Purpose:
        
      
      In robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN), the use of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) helps to localise and outline the tumours as well as the blood vessels within the kidney. The aim of this work is to evaluate the use of the pneumatically attachable flexible (PAF) rail system for US 3D reconstruction of malignant masses in RAPN. The PAF rail system is a novel device developed and previously presented by the authors to enable track-guided US scanning.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We present a comparison study between US 3D reconstruction of masses based on: the da Vinci Surgical System kinematics, single- and stereo-camera tracking of visual markers embedded on the probe. An US-realistic kidney phantom embedding a mass is used for testing. A new design for the US probe attachment to enhance the performance of the kinematic approach is presented. A feature extraction algorithm is proposed to detect the margins of the targeted mass in US images.
    


          Results:
        
      
      To evaluate the performance of the investigated approaches the resulting 3D reconstructions have been compared to a CT scan of the phantom. The data collected indicates that single camera reconstruction outperformed the other approaches, reconstructing with a sub-millimetre accuracy the targeted mass.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This work demonstrates that the PAF rail system provides a reliable platform to enable accurate US 3D reconstruction of masses in RAPN procedures. The proposed system has also the potential to be employed in other surgical procedures such as hepatectomy or laparoscopic liver resection.",0
775,Robotic lateral oropharyngectomy following diagnostic tonsillectomy is oncologically safe in patients with human papillomavirus-related squamous cell cancer: Long-term results,"Introduction:
        
      
      To report the long-term oncological and functional outcomes of en bloc TORS lateral oropharyngectomy to address the close/involved margin following diagnostic tonsillectomy in HPV-related SCC of unknown primary.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A single tertiary center observational cohort over a 4-year period. Primary outcome measures were disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and PSS NOD (Performance Status Scale-Normalcy of Diet) scores.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TORS specimens did not evidence residual carcinoma in 93% of patients. Of 14 patients, 50% received surgery alone (median follow-up 57 months; range 46-96), the remainder surgery and adjuvant therapy (median follow-up of 58 months; range 51-69) with 100% DSS, OS and no deterioration of PSS NOD scores.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Long-term oncological outcomes confirm TORS lateral oropharyngectomy alone is an oncologically safe treatment. Due consideration of this approach is warranted to mitigate against the morbidity of adjuvant radiotherapy treatment in this group of patients.",1
776,Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Left and Extended Left Hepatectomy: An International Multicenter Study Propensity Score-Matched Analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Controversies exist among liver surgeons regarding clinical outcomes of the laparoscopic versus the robotic approach for major complex hepatectomies. The authors therefore designed a study to examine and compare the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic left hepatectomy or extended left hepatectomy (L-LH/L-ELH) versus robotic left hepatectomy or extended left hepatectomy (R-LH/R-ELH) using a large international multicenter collaborative database.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An international multicenter retrospective analysis of 580 patients undergoing L-LH/L-ELH or R-LH/R-ELH at 25 specialized hepatobiliary centers worldwide was undertaken. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was used at a 1:1 nearest-neighbor ratio according to 15 perioperative variables, including demographics, tumor characteristics, Child-Pugh score, presence of portal hypertension, multiple resections, histologic diagnosis, and Iwate difficulty grade.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Before the PSM, 190 (32 %) patients underwent R-LH/R-ELH, and 390 (68 %) patients underwent L-LH/L-ELH. After the matching, 164 patients were identified in each arm without significant differences in demographics, preoperative variables, medical history, tumor pathology, tumor characteristics, or Iwate score. Regarding intra- and postoperative outcomes, the rebotic approach had significantly less estimated blood loss (EBL) (100 ml [IQR 200 ml] vs 200 ml [IQR 235 ml]; p = 0.029), fewer conversions to open operations (n = 4 [2.4 %] vs n = 13, [7.9 %]; p = 0.043), and a shorter hospital stay (6 days [IQR 3 days] vs 7 days [IQR 3.3 days]; p = 0.009).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Both techniques are safe and feasible in major hepatic resections. Compared with L-LH/L-ELH, R-LH/R-ELH is associated with less EBL, fewer conversions to open operations, and a shorter hospital stay.",9
777,Training in minimally invasive surgery in urology: European Association of Urology/International Consultation of Urological Diseases consultation,"Objectives:
        
      
      To describe the progress being made in training for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in urology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A group of experts in the field provided input to agree on recommendations for MIS training. A literature search was carried out to identify studies on MIS training, both in general and specifically for urological procedures.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The literature search showed the rapidly developing options for e-learning, box and virtual training, and suggested that box training is a relatively cheap and effective means of improving laparoscopic skills. Development of non-technical skills is an integral part of surgical skills training and should be included in training curricula. The application of modular training in surgical procedures showed more rapid skills acquisition. Training curricula for MIS in urology are being developed in both the USA and Europe.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Training in MIS has shifted from 'see-one-do-one-teach-one' to a structured learning, from e-learning to skills laboratory and modular training settings.",3
778,Comparing transaxillary robotic thyroidectomy with conventional surgery in a UK population: A case control study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Transaxillary robotic thyroid surgery was pioneered in South Korea where cultural factors, anthropometry and remuneration favour this. Small thyroid nodules account for the majority of cases due to a national thyroid cancer screening programme. However, the technique has not been evaluated in the United Kingdom where larger thyroid nodules tend to undergo surgery in a patient population with a higher body mass index (BMI).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Long term prospective non-randomised study. Sixteen consecutive robotic hemithyroidectomy patients were compared to 16 open controls.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no robotic conversions to open and no significant difference regarding pain, voice, or quality of life (QoL). In the robotic group, long term. scar cosmesis at 3 years was superior (p = 0.02) although the operative time was significantly longer (228 min vs. 85 min, p = 0.01). One patient had a transient recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis and another had temporary shoulder dysfunction. Both resolved in 4 weeks.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study highlights the considerable difference between a Western patient population compared to South East Asia. Despite this robotic thyroidectomy is feasible and safe in a UK population.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite a low uptake in the UK compared to the Far East, robotic thyroidectomy represents a viable option for selected patients, achieving superior cosmesis compared with conventional thyroidectomy at the expense of time and cost. The key is careful patient selection. A randomised study is needed to establish the clinical efficacy compared to conventional surgery in this population.",2
779,Contemporary surgical management of renal oncocytoma: a nation's outcome,"Objective:
        
      
      To report on the contemporary UK experience of surgical management of renal oncocytomas.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Descriptive analysis of practice and postoperative outcomes of patients with a final histological diagnosis of oncocytoma included in The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) nephrectomy registry from 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2016. Short-term outcomes were assessed over a follow-up of 60 days.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Over 4 years, 32 130 renal surgical cases were recorded in the UK, of which 1202 were oncocytomas (3.7%). Most patients were male (756; 62.9%), the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 66.8 (13) years. The median (IQR; range) lesion size was 4.1 (3; 1-25) cm, 43.5% were ≤4 cm and 30.3% were 4-7 cm lesions. In all, 35 patients (2.9%) had preoperative renal tumour biopsy. Most patients had minimally invasive surgery, either radical nephrectomy (683 patients; 56.8%), partial nephrectomy (483; 40.2%) or other procedures (36; 3%). One in five patients (243 patients; 20.2%) had in-hospital complications: 48 were Clavien-Dindo classification grade ≥III (4% of the total cohort), including three deaths. Two additional deaths occurred within 60 days of surgery. The analysis is limited by the study's observational nature, not capturing lesions on surveillance or ablated after biopsy, possible underreporting, short follow-up, and lack of central histology review.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We report on the largest surgical series of renal oncocytomas. In the UK, the complication rate associated with surgical removal of a renal oncocytoma was not negligible. Centralisation of specialist services and increased utilisation of biopsy may inform management, reduce overtreatment, and change patient outcomes for this benign tumour.",9
780,No Evidence for an Effect of the Smell of Hexanal on Trust in Human-Robot Interaction,"The level of interpersonal trust among people is partially determined through the sense of smell. Hexanal, a molecule which smell resembles freshly cut grass, can increase trust in people. Here, we ask the question if smell can be leveraged to facilitate human-robot interaction and test whether hexanal also increases the level of trust during collaboration with a social robot. In a preregistered double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we tested if trial-by-trial and general trust during perceptual decision making in collaboration with a social robot is affected by hexanal across two samples (n = 46 and n = 44). It was hypothesized that unmasked hexanal and hexanal masked by eugenol, a molecule with a smell resembling clove, would increase the level of trust in human-robot interaction, compared to eugenol alone or a control condition consisting of only the neutral smelling solvent propylene glycol. Contrasting previous findings in human interaction, no significant effect of unmasked or eugenol-masked hexanal on trust in robots was observed. These findings indicate that the conscious or nonconscious impact of smell on trust might not generalise to interactions with social robots. One explanation could be category- and context-dependency of smell leading to a mismatch between the natural smell of hexanal, a smell also occurring in human sweat, and the mechanical physical or mental representation of the robot.",4
781,Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures,"Introduction:
        
      
      Recovery of baseline erectile function (EF) after robotic radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk prostate cancer is under-reported. Published studies have selectively reported on low-risk disease using non-validated and poorly defined thresholds for EF recovery.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To assess return to baseline EF in men after robotic radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.
    


          Materials:
        
      
      Five hundred thirty-one men underwent robotic radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer from February 2010 through July 2014. Pre- and postoperative EF was prospectively assessed using the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined the effect of age, preoperative function, comorbidities, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen level, cancer stage or grade, nerve-sparing status, adjuvant therapy, and continence on EF return (defined as postoperative return to baseline EF with or without use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to analyze return over time. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare IIEF-5 scores.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Pre- and postoperative EF was assessed using the IIEF-5 Sexual Health Inventory for Men at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years postoperatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, return of EF was seen in 23.5% of patients at 18 months. This was significantly increased in men no older than 60 years (P = .024), with a preoperative IIEF-5 score of at least 22 (P = .042), and after undergoing neurovascular bundle preservation (34.9% of patients, P < .001). There was no significant change in IIEF-5 scores from 3 to 36 months in patients who were treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the non-neurovascular bundle preservation group (P = .87), although there was significant improvement in those receiving second- or third-line therapies (P = .042). Other than preoperative hypertension (P = .03), none of the other comorbidities predicted return of EF.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this study, 23.5% of men recovered to baseline EF. Of those who underwent bilateral neurovascular bundle preservation robotic radical prostatectomy, 70% recovered baseline EF; however, this accounted for only 9.6% of all patients. Only 4% of men who underwent non-neurovascular bundle preservation had baseline recovery with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors up to 36 months. There was significant improvement after use of second- or third-line therapies, indicating the need for earlier institution of these treatment modalities.",2
782,Pan-European survey on the implementation of minimally invasive pancreatic surgery with emphasis on cancer,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive (MI) pancreatic surgery appears to be gaining popularity, but its implementation throughout Europe and the opinions regarding its use in pancreatic cancer patients are unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 30-question survey was sent between June and December 2014 to pancreatic surgeons of the European Pancreatic Club, European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association and 5 European national pancreatic societies. Incomplete responses were excluded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 237 pancreatic surgeons responded. After excluding 34 incomplete responses, 203 responses from 27 European countries were included. 164 (81%) surgeons were employed at a university hospital, 184 (91%) performed advanced MI surgery and 148 (73%) performed MI distal pancreatectomy. MI pancreatoduodenectomy was performed by 42 (21%) surgeons, whereas 9 (4.4%) surgeons had performed more than 10 procedures. Robot-assisted MI pancreatic surgery was performed by 28 (14%) surgeons. 63 (31%) surgeons expected MI distal pancreatectomy for cancer to be inferior to open distal pancreatectomy concerning oncological outcomes. 151 (74%) surgeons expected to benefit from training in MI distal pancreatectomy and 149 (73%) were willing to participate in a randomized trial on this topic.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      MI distal pancreatectomy is a common procedure, although its use for cancer is still disputed. MI pancreatoduodenectomy is still an uncommon procedure. Specific training and a randomized trial regarding MI pancreatic cancer surgery are welcomed.",3
783,"A Single-centre Early Phase Randomised Controlled Three-arm Trial of Open, Robotic, and Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy (CORAL)","Background:
        
      
      Laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) and robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) are increasingly popular, but high-level evidence for these techniques remains lacking.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the outcomes of patients undergoing open radical cystectomy (ORC), RARC, and LRC.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      From March 2009 to July 2012, 164 patients requiring radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer were invited to participate, with an aim of recruiting 47 patients into each arm. Overall, 93 were suitable for trial inclusion; 60 (65%) agreed and 33 (35%) declined.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      ORC, RARC, or LRC with extracorporeal urinary diversion.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Primary end points were 30- and 90-d complication rates. Secondary end points were perioperative clinical, pathologic, and oncologic outcomes, and quality of life (QoL). The Fisher exact test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analyses.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      The 30-d complication rates (classified by the Clavien-Dindo system) varied significantly between the three arms (ORC: 70%; RARC: 55%; LRC: 26%; p=0.024). ORC complication rates were significantly higher than LRC (p<0.01). The 90-d complication rates did not differ significantly between the three arms (ORC: 70%; RARC: 55%; LRC 32%; p=0.068). Mean operative time was significantly longer in RARC compared with ORC or LRC. ORC resulted in a slower return to oral solids than RARC or LRC. There were no significant differences in QoL measures. Major limitations are the small sample size and potential surgeon bias.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The 30-d complication rates varied by type of surgery and were significantly higher in the ORC arm than the LRC arm. There was no significant difference in 90-d Clavien-graded complication rates between the three arms.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We compared patients having open, robotic, or laparoscopic bladder removal surgery for bladder cancer and found no difference in Clavien-graded complication rates at 90 d.",2
784,Difference between actual vs. pathology prostate weight in TURP and radical robotic-assisted prostatectomy specimen,"Introduction:
        
      
      To investigate and highlight the effect of formaldehyde induced weight reduction in transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and radical robotically-assisted prostatectomy (RALP) specimen as a result of standard chemical fixation.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      51 patients were recruited from January 2013 to June 2013 who either underwent a TURP (n=26) or RALP (n=25). Data was collected prospectively by the operating surgeon who measured the native, unfixed histology specimen directly after operation. The specimens were fixed in 10% Formaldehyde Solution BP and sent to the pathology laboratory where after sufficient fixation period was re-weighed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall mean age 64.78 years, TURP mean age 68.31 years RALP mean age 61.12 years. We found that the overall prostatic specimen (n=51) weight loss after fixation was a mean of 11.20% (3.78 grams) (p ≤ 0.0001). Subgroup analysis of the native TURP chips mean weight was 16.15 grams and formalin treated mean weight was 14.00 grams (p ≤ 0.0001). Therefore, TURP chips had a mean of 13.32 % (2.15 grams) weight loss during chemical fixation. RALP subgroup unfixed specimen mean weight was 52.08 grams and formalin treated mean weight was 42.60 grams (p ≤ 0.0001), a 19.32 % (9.48 grams) mean weight reduction.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It has not been known that prostatic chips and whole human radical prostatectomy specimen undergo a significant weight reduction. The practical significance of the accurate prostate weight in patient management may be limited, however, it is agreed that this should be recorded correctly, as data is potential interest for research purposes and vital for precise documentation.",5
785,Prior experience in laparoscopic rectal surgery can minimise the learning curve for robotic rectal resections: a cumulative sum analysis,"Background:
        
      
      The learning curve for robotic colorectal surgery is ill-defined. This study aimed to investigate the learning curve of experienced laparoscopic rectal surgeons when starting with robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) using cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective case series analysed patients who underwent curative and elective laparoscopic or robotic TMEs for rectal cancer performed by two surgeons. The first consecutive robotic TME cases of each surgeon were 1:1 propensity score matched to their laparoscopic TME cases using age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, T stage (AJCC) and tumour location height. The matched laparoscopic cases defined individual standards for the quality indicators: operating time, R stage, lymph node harvest, length of hospital stay and major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3-5). Deviation of more than a quarter of a standard deviation from the mean for the continuous indicators, or exceeding the observed risk for the binary indicators was defined as off-target with an upward inflection in the CUSUM curve.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From 2006 to 2015, 384 (294 laparoscopic; 90 robotic) TMEs met the inclusion criteria. Surgeon A performed 206 (70.1%) of the laparoscopic and 43 (47.8%) of the robotic cases. Surgeon B performed 88 (29.9%) of the laparoscopic and 47 (52.2%) of the robotic cases. After matching, no covariate exhibited an absolute standardised mean difference >0.25. For surgeon A, the CUSUM curves showed no apparent learning process compared to his laparoscopic standards. For surgeon B, a learning process for operation time, lymph node harvest and major complications was demonstrated by an initial upward inflection of the CUSUM curves; after 15 cases, all quality indicators were generally on target.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      For experienced laparoscopic colorectal surgeons, the formal learning process for robotic TME may be short to reach a similar performance level as obtained in conventional laparoscopy.",9
786,Robotic- and orthosensor-assisted versus manual (ROAM) total knee replacement: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic-arm-assisted knee arthroplasty allows for more accurate component positioning and alignment and is associated with better patient-reported outcomes compared to manually performed jig-based knee arthroplasty. However, what is not known is whether the addition of an intra-articular sensor (VerasenseTM) to aid intraoperative balancing of the total knee replacement (TKR) offers improved functional outcomes for the patient. The purpose of this research is to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing a conventional manual knee replacement to those undergoing TKR using robotic-assisted surgery and the VerasenseTM to optimise alignment and balance the knee joint, respectively, and assess the associated cost economics of such technology.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      This randomised controlled trial will include 90 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing primary TKR. Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria that consent to be in the study will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 to either manual TKR (standard of care) or robotic-arm-assisted TKR with VerasenseTM to aid balancing of the knee. The primary objective will be functional improvement at 6 months following surgery between the two groups. The secondary objectives are to compare changes in knee-specific function, joint awareness, patient expectation and fulfilment, satisfaction, pain, stiffness and functional ability, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and gait patterns between the two groups. Ethical approval was obtained by the Tyne & Wear South Research Ethics Committee, UK. The study is sponsored by the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      This study will assess whether the improved accuracy of component positioning using the robotic-arm-assisted surgery and the VerasenseTM to aid balancing of the TKR offers improved outcome relative to standard manual jig-based systems that are currently the standard of care. This will be assessed primarily according to knee-specific function, but several other measures will also be assessed including whether these are cost-effective interventions.

787,Trans-oral robotic assisted tongue base mucosectomy for investigation of cancer of unknown primary in the head and neck region. The UK experience,"Objectives:
        
      
      The diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary (CUP) in head and neck occurs when the treating clinicians have utilised all available diagnostic tests and failed to identify the origin of the disease. There is no agreed consensus on which diagnostic investigations to use, or the order in which to use them in, although broad recommendations exist. Small tumours arising in the tongue base can be below the limits of resolution of conventional diagnostic techniques. Given the difficulty in targeting the tongue base, current practice involves blind random biopsies, which leads to a variable detection rate. Robotically assisted surgical removal of the tongue base, tongue base mucosectomy (TBM) has been shown to improve diagnostic yield. This study reports the diagnostic hit rate for tongue base primaries using this technique.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Retrospective case review.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      UK Head and Neck Centres.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Patients presenting as an unknown primary, investigated with clinical examination, PET-CT and palatine tonsillectomy.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The detection of a primary site of head and neck cancer in the otherwise unknown primary tumour.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The primary tumour site was identified in the tongue base in 53% (n=17) of patients. In 15 patients the tumour was in the ipsliateral tongue base (88%) while in two cases (12%) the tumour was located in contra lateral tongue base.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Trans-oral robotic assisted TBM raises the possibility of identifying over 50% of tumours that would otherwise be classified as CUP. Identifying these in the contralateral tongue base has implications for treatment planning and outcome.",1
788,"A dosimetric comparison of real-time adaptive and non-adaptive radiotherapy: A multi-institutional study encompassing robotic, gimbaled, multileaf collimator and couch tracking","Purpose:
        
      
      A study of real-time adaptive radiotherapy systems was performed to test the hypothesis that, across delivery systems and institutions, the dosimetric accuracy is improved with adaptive treatments over non-adaptive radiotherapy in the presence of patient-measured tumor motion.
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      Ten institutions with robotic(2), gimbaled(2), MLC(4) or couch tracking(2) used common materials including CT and structure sets, motion traces and planning protocols to create a lung and a prostate plan. For each motion trace, the plan was delivered twice to a moving dosimeter; with and without real-time adaptation. Each measurement was compared to a static measurement and the percentage of failed points for γ-tests recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For all lung traces all measurement sets show improved dose accuracy with a mean 2%/2mm γ-fail rate of 1.6% with adaptation and 15.2% without adaptation (p<0.001). For all prostate the mean 2%/2mm γ-fail rate was 1.4% with adaptation and 17.3% without adaptation (p<0.001). The difference between the four systems was small with an average 2%/2mm γ-fail rate of <3% for all systems with adaptation for lung and prostate.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The investigated systems all accounted for realistic tumor motion accurately and performed to a similar high standard, with real-time adaptation significantly outperforming non-adaptive delivery methods.",2
789,Transoral robotic surgery for residual and recurrent oropharyngeal cancers: Exploratory study of surgical innovation using the IDEAL framework for early-phase surgical studies,"Background:
        
      
      The purpose of this study was to identify the role of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in the management of residual and recurrent oropharyngeal cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term Follow-up) 2a framework.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 26 patients assessed for TORS, 21 underwent the procedure, 5 underwent open resection (4 due to unsuitable anatomy/tumor extent and 1 on the basis of patient choice). Three patients underwent intraoperative ultrasound-assisted robotic resection, and 3 received robotic-assisted free flap inset. A technical refinement for TORS of residual and recurrent oropharyngeal cancer of the tongue base is described. Actuarial plots showed estimated overall survival of 48.2%, local control of 76.6%, and disease-specific survival of 77.1% at 42.6 months.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      TORS is a valid management option for residual and recurrent oropharyngeal cancer. Oncologic outcomes are comparable to open surgery and transoral laser microsurgery, with the added advantages of en bloc resections, facility for intraoperative ultrasound imaging, and inset of free flaps without mandibular split.",1
790,Robotic nephroureterectomy in a horseshoe kidney for upper tract urothelial carcinoma,"Upper tract urothelial carcinoma represents a small proportion (5%-10%) of all urothelial cancers. Although there are several management options, in undifferentiated or high-risk cases, surgery in the form of nephroureterectomy is the gold standard. Horseshoe kidney is the most common congenital renal fusion anomaly affecting 1 in 400-600 patients. We present the case of a smoker in her mid-50s with an incidental finding of a papillary lesion in the right renal pelvis of her horseshoe kidney on CT scan. She went on to have endoscopic assessment confirming no other foci of disease. She was definitively managed with a robotic nephroureterectomy.",0
791,Salvage surgery for residual or recurrent laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma after (Chemo)radiotherapy: Oncological outcomes and prognostic factors,"Nonsurgical primary treatment of early and advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, employing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, is considered a standard of care in many centers throughout the world. When patients have persistent or recurrent disease after non-surgical treatment, salvage surgery is frequently the only remaining potentially curative treatment. Depending on the extent of the residual/recurrent disease, different surgical salvage options are at the surgeon's disposal. In selected cases with limited local disease, salvage transoral laser microsurgery, transoral robotic surgery and open partial laryngectomies can be employed to achieve cure while preserving laryngeal function. For more advanced cases total laryngectomy is necessary. Identifying situations with unacceptable results from surgical salvage may guide future therapies.",0
792,Salvage Radical Prostatectomy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Morbidity and Functional Outcomes from a Large Multicenter Series of Open versus Robotic Approaches,"Purpose:
        
      
      Salvage radical prostatectomy has historically yielded a poor functional outcome and a high complication rate. However, recent reports of robotic salvage radical prostatectomy have demonstrated improved results. In this study we assessed salvage radical prostatectomy functional outcomes and complications when comparing robotic and open approaches.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively collected data on salvage radical prostatectomy for recurrent prostate cancer after local nonsurgical treatment at 18 tertiary referral centers from 2000 to 2016. The Clavien-Dindo classification was applied to classify complications. Complications and functional outcomes were evaluated by univariable and multivariable analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included 395 salvage radical prostatectomies, of which 186 were open and 209 were robotic. Robotic salvage radical prostatectomy yielded lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay (each p <0.0001). No significant difference emerged in the incidence of major and overall complications (10.1%, p=0.16, and 34.9%, p=0.67), including an overall low risk of rectal injury and fistula (1.58% and 2.02%, respectively). However, anastomotic stricture was more frequent for open salvage radical prostatectomy (16.57% vs 7.66%, p <0.01). Overall 24.6% of patients had had severe incontinence, defined as 3 or more pads per day, for 12 or 6 months. On multivariable analysis robotic salvage radical prostatectomy was an independent predictor of continence preservation (OR 0.411, 95% CI 0.232-0.727, p=0.022). Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and the absence of a standardized surgical technique.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this contemporary series to our knowledge salvage radical prostatectomy showed a low risk of major complications and better functional outcomes than previously reported. Robotic salvage radical prostatectomy may reduce anastomotic stricture, blood loss and hospital stay, and improve continence outcomes.",2
793,Oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma in the palatine tonsil: successful resection using trans-oral robotic surgery,"A man in his mid 70s was referred to head and neck outpatients with bulky tissue in the left tonsillar fossa. He had previously been treated for oligometastatic renal clear cell carcinoma (diagnosed over 15 years prior to disease recurrence) by tonsillectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy (years from primary treatment), followed by trans-oral laser surgery to his oropharyngeal recurrence 3 years later. Examination under anaesthetic and biopsy confirmed further recurrence of disease in the left tonsillar fossa, with parapharyngeal extension, which has not been previously reported in the literature. After discussion in the head and neck and urology multi-disciplinary teams meeting, the patient was offered trans-oral robotic-assisted surgery (TORS) for local control and prevention of progression of a fungating oropharyngeal mass. TORS partial pharyngectomy and left buccal artery myomucosal flap reconstruction were successfully carried out, with preservation of some swallow function.",0
794,Outcomes from the Delphi process of the Thoracic Robotic Curriculum Development Committee,"Objectives:
        
      
      As the adoption of robotic procedures becomes more widespread, additional risk related to the learning curve can be expected. This article reports the results of a Delphi process to define procedures to optimize robotic training of thoracic surgeons and to promote safe performance of established robotic interventions as, for example, lung cancer and thymoma surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In June 2016, a working panel was spontaneously created by members of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) with a specialist interest in robotic thoracic surgery and/or surgical training. An e-consensus-finding exercise using the Delphi methodology was applied requiring 80% agreement to reach consensus on each question. Repeated iterations of anonymous voting continued over 3 rounds.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Agreement was reached on many points: a standardized robotic training curriculum for robotic thoracic surgery should be divided into clearly defined sections as a staged learning pathway; the basic robotic curriculum should include a baseline evaluation, an e-learning module, a simulation-based training (including virtual reality simulation, Dry lab and Wet lab) and a robotic theatre (bedside) observation. Advanced robotic training should include e-learning on index procedures (right upper lobe) with video demonstration, access to video library of robotic procedures, simulation training, modular console training to index procedure, transition to full-procedure training with a proctor and final evaluation of the submitted video to certified independent examiners.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Agreement was reached on a large number of questions to optimize and standardize training and education of thoracic surgeons in robotic activity. The production of the content of the learning material is ongoing.",3
795,Cost-effectiveness of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer in the UK,"Importance:
        
      
      The cost-effectiveness of different surgical techniques for radical prostatectomy remains a subject of debate. Emergence of recent critical clinical data and changes in surgical equipment costs due to their shared use by different clinical specialties necessitate an updated cost-effectiveness analysis in a centralized, largely government-funded health care system such as the UK National Health Service (NHS).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic-assisted radical prostatectomy (LRP) using contemporary data on clinical outcomes, costs, and surgical volumes in the UK.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This economic analysis used a Markov model developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of RARP, LRP, and ORP to treat localized prostate cancer. The model was constructed from the perspective of the UK NHS. The model simulated 65-year-old men who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and were followed up for a 10-year period. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, LRP, and ORP.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (direct medical costs and costs outside the NHS), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Compared with LRP, RARP cost £1785 (US $2350) less and had 0.24 more QALYs gained; thus, RARP was a dominant option compared with LRP. Compared with ORP, RARP had 0.12 more QALYs gained but cost £526 (US $693) more during the 10-year time frame, resulting in an ICER of £4293 (US $5653)/QALY. Because the ICER was below the £30 000 (US $39 503) willingness-to-pay threshold, RARP was more cost-effective than ORP in the UK. The most sensitive variable influencing the cost-effectiveness of RARP was the lower risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). Scenario analysis indicated RARP would remain more cost-effective than ORP as long as the BCR hazard ratios comparing RARP vs ORP were less than 0.99.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      These findings suggest that in the UK, RARP has an ICER lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold and thus is likely a cost-effective surgical treatment option for patients with localized prostate cancer compared with ORP and LRP. The results were mainly driven by the lower risk of BCR for RARP. These findings may differ in other health care settings where different thresholds and costs may apply.",5
796,Implementation of robotic rectal surgery training programme: importance of standardisation and structured training,"Purpose:
        
      
      A structured training programme is essential for the safe adoption of robotic rectal cancer surgery. The aim of this study is to describe the training pathway and short-term surgical outcomes of three surgeons in two centres (UK and Portugal) undertaking single-docking robotic rectal surgery with the da Vinci Xi and integrated table motion (ITM).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prospectively, collected data for consecutive patients who underwent robotic rectal cancer resections with the da Vinci Xi and ITM between November 2015 and September 2017 was analysed. The short-term surgical outcomes of the first ten cases of each surgeon (supervised) were compared with the subsequent cases (independent). In addition, the Global Assessment Score (GAS) forms from the supervised cases were analysed and the GAS cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts constructed to investigate the training pathway of the participating surgeons.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Data from 82 patients was analysed. There were no conversions to open, no anastomotic leaks and no 30-day mortality. Mean operation time was 288 min (SD 63), median estimated blood loss 20 (IQR 20-20) ml and median length of stay 5 (IQR 4-8) days. Thirty-day readmission and reoperation rates were 4% (n = 3) and 6% (n = 5) respectively. When comparing the supervised cases with the subsequent solo cases, there were no statistically significant changes in any of the short-term outcomes with the exception of mean operative time, which was significantly shorter in the independent cases (311 vs 275 min, p = 0.038). GAS form analysis and GAS CUSUM charting revealed that ten proctoring cases were enough for trainee surgeons to independently perform robotic rectal resections with the da Vinci Xi.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our results show that by applying a structured training pathway and standardising the surgical technique, the single-docking procedure with the da Vinci Xi is a valid, reproducible technique that offers good short-term outcomes in our study population.",3
797,Retzius sparing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy vs. conventional robotic assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Context:
        
      
      Retzius sparing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy appears to have better continence rates when compared to conventional robotic assisted radical prostatectomy, however, concern with high positive surgical margin rates exist.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To systematically evaluate evidence comparing functional and oncological outcomes of retzius sparing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy and conventional robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Bibliographic databases searched were PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials-CENTRAL (in The Cochrane library-issue 1, 2018). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      The search retrieved 137 references through electronic searches of various databases. Six were included in the review. RS-RALP was associated with better early continence rates (≤ 1 month) (moderate quality evidence) (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.27, 2.32, p 0.0005) and at 3 months (low quality evidence) (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03, 1.88, p 0.03). Time to continence recovery, number of pads used and pad weight are better with RS-RALP. Based on very low quality evidence, RS-RALP did not alter 6 and 12 months continence rates. Based on very low quality evidence, RS-RALP did not alter T2 positive margin rates (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.91, 3.06, p 0.10) and T3 positive margin rates (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.68, 1.70, p = 0.75). Short-term biochemical free survival appears to be similar between the two approaches. Based on low-quality evidence, RS-RALP did not alter overall and major complication rates.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RS-RARP appears to have earlier continence recovery when compared to Con-RARP which does not come at a significant oncologic cost. Whilst there was a trend towards higher PSM rates with RS-RALP, this did not achieve statistical significance. Furthermore this trend appeared to be less pronounced with T3 disease, where the PSM rates are almost similar.",2
798,"Cross-sectional study of patient-reported fatigue, physical activity and cardiovascular status in men after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy","Purpose:
        
      
      Patient-reported fatigue after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has not been characterised to date. Fatigue after other prostate cancer (PCa) treatments is known to impact on patient-reported quality of life. The aim of this study was to characterise fatigue, physical activity levels and cardiovascular status post-RARP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Between October 2016 and March 2017, men post-RARP or on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were invited into the study. Participants were asked to complete the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and Stage of Change and Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaires (SPAQ) over a 2-week period. Outcome measures were patient-reported fatigue, physical activity levels and the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (Q-Risk). Data were analysed in SPSS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      96/117 (82%) men approached consented to participate; of these, 62/96 (65%) returned complete questionnaire data (RARP n = 42, ADT n = 20). All men reported fatigue with 9/42 (21%) post-RARP reporting clinically significant fatigue. Physical activity did not correlate with fatigue. On average, both groups were overweight (BMI 27.0 ± 3.9 kg/m2 and 27.8 ± 12.3 kg/m2 for RARP and ADT, respectively) and the post-RARP group had an 18.1% ± 7.4% Q-Risk2 score.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A proportion of men is at increased risk of cardiovascular disease within 10 years post-RARP and have substantial levels of fatigue; therefore, clinicians should consider including these factors when counselling patients about RARP. Additionally, men post-RARP did not meet the recommended guidelines for resistance-based exercise. Future research is needed to establish whether interventions including resistance-based exercise can improve health and fatigue levels in this population.",0
799,Group activity with Paro in nursing homes: systematic investigation of behaviors in participants,"Background:
        
      
      A variety of group activities is promoted for nursing home (NH) residents with dementia with the aim to reduce apathy and to increase engagement and social interaction. Investigating behaviors related to these outcomes could produce insights into how the activities work. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate behaviors seen in people with dementia during group activity with the seal robot Paro, differences in behaviors related to severity of dementia, and to explore changes in behaviors.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Thirty participants from five NHs formed groups of five to six participants at each NH. Group sessions with Paro lasted for 30 minutes twice a week during 12 weeks of intervention. Video recordings were conducted in the second and tenth week. An ethogram, containing 18 accurately defined and described behaviors, mapped the participants' behaviors. Duration of behaviors, such as ""Observing Paro,"" ""Conversation with Paro on the lap,"" ""Smile/laughter toward other participants,"" were converted to percentage of total session time and analyzed statistically.
    


          Results:
        
      
      ""Observing Paro"" was observed more often in participants with mild to moderate dementia (p = 0.019), while the variable ""Observing other things"" occurred more in the group of severe dementia (p = 0.042). ""Smile/laughter toward other participants"" showed an increase (p = 0.011), and ""Conversations with Paro on the lap"" showed a decrease (p = 0.014) during the intervention period.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Participants with severe dementia seemed to have difficulty in maintaining attention toward Paro during the group session. In the group as a whole, Paro seemed to be a mediator for increased social interactions and created engagement.",7
800,Totally robotic rectal resection: an experience of the first 100 consecutive cases,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic surgery provides an alternative option for a minimal access approach. It provides a stable platform with high definition three-dimensional views and improved access, which enhances the capabilities for precise dissection in a narrow surgical field. These distinctive features have made it an attractive option for colorectal surgeons.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to present a standardised technique for single-docking robotic rectal resection and to analyse clinical outcomes of the first 100 robotic rectal procedures performed in a single centre between May 2013 and April 2015.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Prospectively collected data related to 100 consecutive patients who underwent single-docking robotic rectal surgery was analysed for surgical and oncological outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-six patients were male, the median age was 67 years (range-24-92). Eighteen patients had neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy whilst 23 patients had BMI >30. Procedures performed included anterior resection (n = 74), abdominoperineal resection (n = 10), completion proctectomy (n = 9), restorative proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (n = 5) and Hartmann's procedure (n = 2). The median operating time was 240 min (range-135-456), and median blood loss was 10 ml (range 0-200). There was no conversion or intra-operative complication. Median length of stay was 7 days (range, 3-48) and readmission rate was 12 %. Thirty-day mortality was zero. Postoperatively, two patients had an anastomotic leak whilst two had small bowel obstruction. The median lymph node harvest was 18 (range, 6-43).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The single-docking robotic technique should be considered as an alternative option for rectal surgery. This approach is safe and feasible and in our study it has demonstrated favourable clinical outcomes.",3
801,Intraoperative robotic-assisted low anterior rectal resection performance assessment using procedure-specific binary metrics and a global rating scale,"Background:
        
      
      This study aimed to evaluate the use of binary metric-based (proficiency-based progression; PBP) performance assessments and global evaluative assessment of robotic skills (GEARS) of a robotic-assisted low anterior rectal resection (RA-LAR) procedure.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A prospective study of video analysis of RA-LAR procedures was carried out using the PBP metrics with binary parameters previously developed, and GEARS. Recordings were collected from five novice surgeons (≤30 RA-LAR previously performed) and seven experienced surgeons (>30 RA-LAR previously performed). Two consultant colorectal surgeons were trained to be assessors in the use of PBP binary parameters to evaluate the procedure phases, surgical steps, errors, and critical errors in male and female patients and GEARS scores. Novice and experienced surgeons were categorized and assessed using PBP metrics and GEARS; mean scores obtained were compared for statistical purpose. Also, the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of these assessment tools was evaluated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty unedited recordings of RA-LAR procedures were blindly assessed. Overall, using PBP metric-based assessment, a subgroup of experienced surgeons made more errors (20 versus 16, P = 0.158) and critical errors (9.2 versus 7.8, P = 0.417) than the novice group, although not significantly. However, during the critical phase of RA-LAR, experienced surgeons made significantly fewer errors than the novice group (95% CI of the difference, Lower = 0.104 - Upper = 5.155, df = 11.9, t = 2.23, p = 0.042), and a similar pattern was observed for critical errors. The PBP metric and GEARS assessment tools distinguished between the objectively assessed performance of experienced and novice colorectal surgeons performing RA-LAR (total error scores with PBP metrics, P = 0.019-0.008; GEARS scores, P = 0.029-0.025). GEARS demonstrated poor IRR (mean IRR 0.49) and weaker discrimination between groups (15-41 per cent difference). PBP binary metrics demonstrated good IRR (mean 0.94) and robust discrimination particularly for total error scores (58-64 per cent).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      PBP binary metrics seem to be useful for metric-based training for surgeons learning RA-LAR procedures.",6
802,Robots in Healthcare: a Scoping Review,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Robots are increasingly being adopted in healthcare to carry out various tasks that enhance patient care. This scoping review aims to establish the types of robots being used in healthcare and identify where they are deployed.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      Technological advancements have enabled robots to conduct increasingly varied and complex roles in healthcare. For instance, precision tasks such as improving dexterity following stroke or assisting with percutaneous coronary intervention.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      This review found that robots have played 10 main roles across a variety of clinical environments. The two predominant roles were surgical and rehabilitation and mobility. Although robots were mainly studied in the surgical theatre and rehabilitation unit, other settings ranged from the hospital ward to inpatient pharmacy. Healthcare needs are constantly evolving, as demonstrated by COVID-19, and robots may assist in adapting to these changes. The future will involve increased telepresence and infrastructure systems will have to improve to allow for this.

803,Feasibility of Robot-Assisted Ultrasound Imaging with Force Feedback for Assessment of Thyroid Diseases,"Medical ultrasound is extensively used to define tissue textures and to characterize lesions, and it is the modality of choice for detection and follow-up assessment of thyroid diseases. Classical medical ultrasound procedures are performed manually by an occupational operator with a hand-held ultrasound probe. These procedures require high physical and cognitive burden and yield clinical results that are highly operator-dependent, therefore frequently diminishing trust in ultrasound imaging data accuracy in repetitive assessment. A robotic ultrasound procedure, on the other hand, is an emerging paradigm integrating a robotic arm with an ultrasound probe. It achieves an automated or semi-automated ultrasound scanning by controlling the scanning trajectory, region of interest, and the contact force. Therefore, the scanning becomes more informative and comparable in subsequent examinations over a long-time span. In this work, we present a technique for allowing operators to reproduce reliably comparable ultrasound images with the combination of predefined trajectory execution and real-time force feedback control. The platform utilized features a 7-axis robotic arm capable of 6-DoF force-torque sensing and a linear-array ultrasound probe. The measured forces and torques affecting the probe are used to adaptively modify the predefined trajectory during autonomously performed examinations and probe-phantom interaction force accuracy is evaluated. In parallel, by processing and combining ultrasound B-Mode images with probe spatial information, structural features can be extracted from the scanning volume through a 3D scan. The validation was performed on a tissue-mimicking phantom containing thyroid features, and we successfully demonstrated high image registration accuracy between multiple trials.",0
804,Child-Robot Interactions for Second Language Tutoring to Preschool Children,"In this digital age social robots will increasingly be used for educational purposes, such as second language tutoring. In this perspective article, we propose a number of design features to develop a child-friendly social robot that can effectively support children in second language learning, and we discuss some technical challenges for developing these. The features we propose include choices to develop the robot such that it can act as a peer to motivate the child during second language learning and build trust at the same time, while still being more knowledgeable than the child and scaffolding that knowledge in adult-like manner. We also believe that the first impressions children have about robots are crucial for them to build trust and common ground, which would support child-robot interactions in the long term. We therefore propose a strategy to introduce the robot in a safe way to toddlers. Other features relate to the ability to adapt to individual children's language proficiency, respond contingently, both temporally and semantically, establish joint attention, use meaningful gestures, provide effective feedback and monitor children's learning progress. Technical challenges we observe include automatic speech recognition (ASR) for children, reliable object recognition to facilitate semantic contingency and establishing joint attention, and developing human-like gestures with a robot that does not have the same morphology humans have. We briefly discuss an experiment in which we investigate how children respond to different forms of feedback the robot can give.",4
805,Robot-assisted management of Zinner's syndrome: report of seminal vesicle sparing technique and review of literature,The range of urological procedures performed with robotic assistance has widened with increasing experience with the da Vinci robotic system. We describe the use of the da Vinci SI Surgical System for excision of a seminal vesicle cyst in a patient who had associated ipsilateral renal agenesis (Zinner's syndrome). The robotic platform afforded a minimally invasive procedure with precise dissection and no collateral damage to neighbouring vital anatomy.,1
806,Exploring Behaviors of Caterpillar-Like Soft Robots with a Central Pattern Generator-Based Controller and Reinforcement Learning,"Due to their flexibility, soft-bodied robots can potentially achieve rich and various behaviors within a single body. However, to date, no methodology has effectively harnessed these robots to achieve such diverse desired functionalities. Controllers that accomplish only a limited range of behaviors in such robots have been handcrafted. Moreover, the behaviors of these robots should be determined through body-environment interactions because an appropriate behavior may not always be manifested even if the body dynamics are given. Therefore, we have proposed SenseCPG-PGPE, a method for automatically designing behaviors for caterpillar-like soft-bodied robots. This method optimizes mechanosensory feedback to a central pattern generator (CPG)-based controller, which controls actuators in a robot, using policy gradients with parameter-based exploration (PGPE). In this article, we deeply investigated this method. We found that PGPE can optimize a CPG-based controller for soft-bodied robots that exhibit viscoelasticity and large deformation, whereas other popular policy gradient methods, such as trust region policy optimization and proximal policy optimization, cannot. Scalability of the method was confirmed using simulation as well. Although SenseCPG-PGPE uses a CPG-based controller, it can achieve nonsteady motion such as climbing a step in a simulated robot. The approach also resulted in distinctive behaviors depending on different body-environment conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables soft robots to explore a variety of behaviors automatically.",4
807,Implicit Active Constraints for Robot-Assisted Arthroscopy,"This paper presents an Implicit Active Constraints control framework for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. It extends on current frameworks by prescribing the external constraints implicitly from the operator motion, forgoing the need for pre-operative imaging; the constraints are defined in situ so as to avoid the use of invasive fiducial markers. A hands-on cooperatively-controlled robotic platform, comprising of a surgical instrument and a compliant manipulator, has been designed for an arthroscopic procedure. The surgical platform is capable of constraining the pose of the instrument so as to ensure it passes through the incision point and does not cause trauma to the surrounding tissue. A flexible arthroscopic instrument is designed and its use is investigated to enlarge reachable and dexterous workspace, increasing the accessibility to the target anatomy. The behaviour of the flexible instrument is analysed. A detailed performance analysis is conducted on a group of subjects for validating the control framework, simulating a minimally invasive arthroscopic procedure. Results demonstrate a statistically significant enhancement in the control ergonomics as well as the accuracy and safety of the procedure.",1
808,Review: Current concepts in computer-assisted hip arthroscopy,"In the last 15 years, hip arthroscopy has become increasingly popular in addressing femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) because of its minimally invasive approach. However, assessing the adequacy of bone resection when correcting FAI can be difficult because visualisation and spatial awareness of the joint are poor. Recent advances in technology in the field of computer-assisted surgery and navigation and robotic surgery in orthopaedics as a resource for preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance have been widely reported. This technology is expected to upgrade surgical planning and operative techniques, decrease human error and improve patient outcomes by precisely defining the divergent anatomy and kinematics of the hip joint. This review attempts to bring the reader up-to-date with the current developments in the field of computer assisted hip arthroscopy, and discusses our experience with pre-operative planning, navigation and robotics and also provides a platform for future research in this arena.",1
809,Utilising an Accelerated Delphi Process to Develop Guidance and Protocols for Telepresence Applications in Remote Robotic Surgery Training,"Context:
        
      
      The role of robot-assisted surgery continues to expand at a time when trainers and proctors have travel restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To provide guidance on setting up and running an optimised telementoring service that can be integrated into current validated curricula. We define a standardised approach to training candidates in skill acquisition via telepresence technologies. We aim to describe an approach based on the current evidence and available technologies, and define the key elements within optimised telepresence services, by seeking consensus from an expert committee comprising key opinion leaders in training.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      This project was carried out in phases: a systematic review of the current literature, a teleconference meeting, and then an initial survey were conducted based on the current evidence and expert opinion, and sent to the committee. Twenty-four experts in training, including clinicians, academics, and industry, contributed to the Delphi process. An accelerated Delphi process underwent three rounds and was completed within 72 h. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as ≥80% agreement.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      There was 100% consensus regarding an urgent need for international agreement on guidance for optimised telepresence. Consensus was reached in multiple areas, including (1) infrastructure and functionality; (2) definitions and terminology; (3) protocols for training, communication, and safety issues; and (4) accountability including ethical and legal issues. The resulting formulated guidance showed good internal consistency among experts, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.90.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Using the Delphi methodology, we achieved international consensus among experts for development and content validation of optimised telepresence services for robotic surgery training. This guidance lays the foundation for launching telepresence services in robotic surgery. This guidance will require further validation.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Owing to travel restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, development of remote training and support via telemedicine is becoming increasingly important. We report a key opinion leader consensus view on a standardised approach to telepresence.",3
810,A systematic review of robot-assisted anti-reflux surgery to examine reporting standards,"Robot-assisted anti-reflux surgery (RA-ARS) is increasingly being used to treat refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow up) Collaboration's framework aims to improve the evaluation of surgical innovation, but the extent to which the evolution of RA-ARS has followed this model is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the standard to which RA-ARS has been reported during its evolution, in relation to the IDEAL framework. A systematic review from inception to June 2020 was undertaken to identify all primary English language studies pertaining to RA-ARS. Studies of paraoesophageal or giant hernias were excluded. Data extraction was informed by IDEAL guidelines and summarised by narrative synthesis. Twenty-three studies were included: two case reports, five case series, ten cohort studies and six randomised controlled trials. The majority were single-centre studies comparing RA-ARS and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Eleven (48%) studies reported patient selection criteria, with high variability between studies. Few studies reported conflicts of interest (30%), funding arrangements (26%), or surgeons' prior robotic experience (13%). Outcome reporting was heterogeneous; 157 distinct outcomes were identified. No single outcome was reported in all studies.The under-reporting of important aspects of study design and high degree of outcome heterogeneity impedes the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the body of evidence. There is a need for further well-designed prospective studies and randomised trials, alongside agreement about outcome selection, measurement and reporting for future RA-ARS studies.",2
811,Action observation in the infant brain: the role of body form and motion,"Much research has been carried out to understand how human brains make sense of another agent in motion. Current views based on human adult and monkey studies assume a matching process in the motor system biased toward actions performed by conspecifics and present in the observer's motor repertoire. However, little is known about the neural correlates of action cognition in early ontogeny. In this study, we examined the processes involved in the observation of full body movements in 4-month-old infants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure localized brain activation. In a 2 × 2 design, infants watched human or robotic figures moving in a smooth, familiar human-like manner, or in a rigid, unfamiliar robot-like manner. We found that infant premotor cortex responded more strongly to observe robot-like motion compared with human-like motion. Contrary to current views, this suggests that the infant motor system is flexibly engaged by novel movement patterns. Moreover, temporal cortex responses indicate that infants integrate information about form and motion during action observation. The response patterns obtained in premotor and temporal cortices during action observation in these young infants are very similar to those reported for adults. These findings thus suggest that the brain processes involved in the analysis of an agent in motion in adults become functionally specialized very early in human development.",4
812,Synchronous robotic repair of anterior diaphragmatic (Morgagni) hernia & low anterior resection for rectal cancer,"Background:
        
      
      We present the case report of synchronous trans-fascial repair of a large congenital Morgagni hernia (MH) and low anterior resection using a fully robotic approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A 61-year old female presented with fresh red blood in her stool. She had a previous history of abdominal hysterectomy and a performance status of 0. Imaging revealed a low rectal cancer and incidental large MH.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using the Da Vinci X platform the procedure was successfully performed; total operating time of 450 min, <200 ml blood loss and 5 days hospital stay. Post-operative scan at 6 months, 1 and 2 years showed no evidence of hernia or cancer recurrence.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We have demonstrated that complex multi-visceral procedures can be safely performed on fully robotic platforms, even in previously disturbed surgical fields. The robotic approach may provide the opportunity for seamless multi-speciality operating simultaneously in multiple body cavities.",0
813,Comparison of robotic vs laparoscopic left-sided colorectal cancer resections,"Robotic assisted surgery (RAS) has become increasingly adopted in colorectal cancer surgery. This study aims to compare robotic and laparoscopic approaches to left sided colorectal resections in terms of surgical outcomeswith no formal enhanced recovery programme. All patients undergoing robotic or laparoscopic left sided or rectal (high and low anterior resection) cancer surgery at a single tertiary referral centre over 3 years were included.A total of 184 consecutive patients from July 2017 to December 2020 were included in this study, with 40.2% (n=74/184) undergoing RAS. The median age at time of surgery was 68 years (IQR 60-73 years). RAS had a significantly shorter length of median stay of 3 days, compared to 5 days in the conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) group (p<0.001). RAS had a significantly lower rate of conversion to open surgery (0% vs 16.4%, p<0.001). The median operative time was also shorter in RAS (308 minutes), compared to CLS (326 minutes, p=0.019). The overall rate of any complication was 16.8%, with the RAS experiencing a lower complication rate (12.2% vs 20.0%, p=0.041). There was no significant difference in anastomotic leak rates between the two groups (4.0% vs 5.5%, p=0.673), or in terms of complete resection (R0) (robotic 98.6%, laparoscopic 100%, p=0.095). Robotic left sided colorectal surgery delivers equivalent oncological resection compared to laparoscopic approaches, with the added benefits of reduced length of stay and lower rates of conversion to open surgery. This has both clinical and healthcare economic benefits.",9
814,Oncologic outcomes of minimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"In the absence of randomized trials, uncertainty regarding the oncologic efficacy of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) remains. This systematic review aimed to compare oncologic outcomes after MIDP (laparoscopic or robot-assisted) and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Matched and non-matched studies were included. Pooled analyses were performed for pathology (e.g., microscopically radical (R0) resection and lymph node retrieval) and oncologic outcomes (e.g., overall survival). After screening 1760 studies, 21 studies with 11,246 patients were included. Overall survival (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.01; p = 0.06), R0 resection rate (odds ratio (OR) 1.24; 95%CI 0.97 to 1.58; p = 0.09) and use of adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 1.07; 95%CI 0.89 to 1.30; p = 0.46) were comparable for MIDP and ODP. The lymph node yield (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.3 lymph nodes; 95%CI -2.46 to -0.15; p = 0.03) was lower after MIDP. Patients undergoing MIDP were more likely to have smaller tumors (WMD -0.46 cm; 95%CI -0.67 to -0.24; p < 0.001), less perineural (OR 0.48; 95%CI 0.33 to 0.70; p < 0.001) and less lymphovascular invasion (OR 0.53; 95%CI 0.38 to 0.74; p < 0.001) reflecting earlier staged disease as a result of treatment allocation bias. Based on these results we can conclude that in patients with PDAC, MIDP is associated with comparable survival, R0 resection, and use of adjuvant chemotherapy, but a lower lymph node yield, as compared to ODP. Due to treatment allocation bias and lower lymph node yield the oncologic efficacy of MIDP remains uncertain.",2
815,Perioperative and oncological outcomes of radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer in the UK: an analysis of surgeon-reported data,"Objectives:
        
      
      To analyse the perioperative and oncological outcomes of all radical prostatectomies (RPs) performed for high-risk prostate cancer in the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) national registry from 2014 to 2015.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We identified and analysed outcomes of all RPs performed for high-risk prostate cancer (clinical stage >T2 and/or biopsy Gleason grade >7 and/or preoperative prostate-specific antigen level ≥20 ng/mL) in the national registry for 2014 and 2015. Surgeon reporting of data was mandated during this period. Institution and individual surgeon volume-outcome relationships were assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 3671/13 947 (26.3%) patients underwent RP for high-risk prostate cancer over the 2-year period. Robot-assisted RP was the most prevalent approach (60.7%). In all, 39% of men received an extended pelvic lymph node dissection (LND), but over one-third (33.8%) had no LND. Minimally invasive techniques were associated with a significantly shorter length of stay. The reported rates of Clavien-Dindo ≥III complications within the dataset were low (2.0%), regardless of surgical modality or surgeon volume. No statistically significant surgeon volume-outcome relationships were identified when surgeon volume was stratified into tertiles.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RP for high-risk prostate cancer in the UK appears safe, regardless of modality used or surgeon volume. No clear evidence that surgeon volume impacts on early perioperative outcomes was seen. Quality assurance of the surgeon-reported BAUS dataset is now required to drive quality improvement in national practice.",2
816,Transoral tongue base mucosectomy for the identification of the primary site in the work-up of cancers of unknown origin: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      The use of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and laser microsurgery (TLM) in the diagnosis and identification of the site of the unknown primary has become increasingly common. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the use and efficacy of TORS and TLM for this indication.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies employing TORS or TLM in diagnosis of the unknown primary tumor site in patients with cervical nodal metastases of squamous cell origin. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINHAL were searched from inception to July 2018 for all studies that used TORS and or TLM in identifying the unknown primary.
    


          Results:
        
      
      251 studies were identified, of which 21 were eligible for inclusion. The primary tumour was identified by TORS/TLM in 78% of patients (433 out of 556). Tongue base mucosectomy (TBM) identified the primary in 222 of 427 cases (53%). In patients with negative physical examination, diagnostic imaging and PETCT, TBM identified the primary in 64% (95% CI 50, 79) cases. In patients who had negative CT/MRI imaging, negative PETCT and negative EUA and tonsillectomy, TBM identified a tongue base primary in 78% (95% CI 41, 92) cases. Haemorrhage, the commonest complication, was reported in 4.9% cases. Mean length of stay varied between 1.4 and 6.3 days.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Tongue base mucosectomy, performed by TORS or TLM, is highly efficacious in identifying the unknown primary in the head and neck region.",1
817,Robotic rectal cancer surgery in obese patients may lead to better short-term outcomes when compared to laparoscopy: a comparative propensity scored match study,"Purpose:
        
      
      Laparoscopic rectal surgery in obese patients is technically challenging. The technological advantages of robotic instruments can help overcome some of those challenges, but whether this translates to superior short-term outcomes is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to compare the short-term surgical outcomes of obese (BMI ≥ 30) robotic and laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All consecutive obese patients receiving laparoscopic and robotic rectal cancer resection surgery from three centres, two from the UK and one from Portugal, between 2006 and 2017 were identified from prospectively collated databases. Robotic surgery patients were propensity score matched with laparoscopic patients for ASA grade, neoadjuvant radiotherapy and pathological T stage. Their short-term outcomes were examined.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 222 patients were identified (63 robotic, 159 laparoscopic). The 63 patients who received robotic surgery were matched with 61 laparoscopic patients. Cohort characteristics were similar between the two groups. In the robotic group, operative time was longer (260 vs 215 min; p = 0.000), but length of stay was shorter (6 vs 8 days; p = 0.014), and thirty-day readmission rate was lower (6.3% vs 19.7%; p = 0.033).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study population, robotic rectal surgery in obese patients resulted in a shorter length of stay and lower 30-day readmission rate but longer operative time when compared to laparoscopic surgery. Robotic rectal surgery in the obese may be associated with a quicker post-operative recovery and reduced morbidity profile. Larger-scale multi-centre prospective observational studies are required to validate these results.",9
818,"NeuroSAFE PROOF: study protocol for a single-blinded, IDEAL stage 3, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of NeuroSAFE robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy versus standard robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in men with localized prostate cancer","Background:
        
      
      Robotic radical prostatectomy (RARP) is a first-line curative treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Postoperative erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence are common associated adverse side effects that can negatively impact patients' quality of life. Preserving the lateral neurovascular bundles (NS) during RARP improves functional outcomes. However, selecting men for NS may be difficult when there is concern about incurring in positive surgical margin (PSM) which in turn risks adverse oncological outcomes. The NeuroSAFE technique (intra-operative frozen section examination of the neurovascular structure adjacent prostate margin) can provide real-time pathological consult to promote optimal NS whilst avoiding PSM.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      NeuroSAFE PROOF is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which men are randomly allocated 1:1 to either NeuroSAFE RARP or standard RARP. Men electing for RARP as primary treatment, who are continent and have good baseline erectile function (EF), defined by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score > 21, are eligible. NS in the intervention arm is guided by the NeuroSAFE technique. NS in the standard arm is based on standard of care, i.e. a pre-operative image-based planning meeting, patient-specific clinical information, and digital rectal examination. The primary outcome is assessment of EF at 12 months. The primary endpoint is the proportion of men who achieve IIEF-5 score ≥ 21. A sample size of 404 was calculated to give a power of 90% to detect a difference of 14% between groups based on a feasibility study. Oncological outcomes are continuously monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. Key secondary outcomes include urinary continence at 3 months assessed by the international consultation on incontinence questionnaire, rate of biochemical recurrence, EF recovery at 24 months, and difference in quality of life.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      NeuroSAFE PROOF is the first RCT of intra-operative frozen section during radical prostatectomy in the world. It is properly powered to evaluate a difference in the recovery of EF for men undergoing RARP assessed by patient-reported outcome measures. It will provide evidence to guide the use of the NeuroSAFE technique around the world.

819,Robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy provides better operative outcomes as compared to the laparoscopic and open approaches: results from a prospective cohort study,"The objective of this is to compare the surgical outcomes of partial nephrectomy (PN), performed via three different approaches: robot-assisted (RAPN), laparoscopic (LPN), and open (OPN), in a single non-academic regional center. The data of patients undergoing PN at our Department from 2005 to 2016 were prospectively collected. A logistic regression model adjusted for preoperative variables (age, tumor size, creatinine and hemoglobin, ASA and Padua scores) was performed to evaluate whether transfusion, conversion, and postoperative complication rate were influenced by the surgical approach. Overall 270 patients underwent PN: analysis included 253 cases (RAPN = 110, LPN = 70, OPN = 73). Preoperative variables did not differ significantly among the three groups. Shorter operative (130 vs 180 and 200') and ischaemia (12 vs 23 and 22') times and longer hospital stay (8 vs 7 and 6 days) were found in the OPN group as compared to LPN and RAPN, respectively. The RAPN group included a higher rate of pT1b (31.8 vs 14.2 and 15%) and malignant histotype (90 vs 82.9 and 68.5%) as compared to LPN and OPN, respectively. Clavien Grade III-IV complications were lower in the RAPN (7.2%) as compared to OPN (12.3%) and LPN (17.1%) groups. Multivariate analysis showed a lower risk for conversion, transfusion and overall complications in the RAPN group versus LPN and OPN. The surgical approach affects the perioperative outcomes in a regional setting. The advantages of RAPN over OPN (lower risk of conversion, transfusion, and overall complications) are extended over LPN as well, although OPN offered faster operative and ischemia times at the expense of greater blood loss and hospital stay.",9
820,"A pelvic implant orthosis in rodents, for spinal cord injury rehabilitation, and for brain machine interface research: construction, surgical implantation and validation","Background:
        
      
      Rodents are important model systems used to explore spinal cord injury (SCI) and rehabilitation, and brain machine interfaces (BMI). We present a new method to provide mechanical interaction for BMI and rehabilitation in rat models of SCI.
    


          New method:
        
      
      We present the design and implantation procedures for a pelvic orthosis that allows direct force application to the skeleton in brain machine interface and robot rehabilitation applications in rodents. We detail the materials, construction, machining, surgery and validation of the device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We describe the statistical validation of the implant procedures by comparing stepping parameters of 8 rats prior to and after implantation and surgical recovery. An ANOVA showed no effects of the implantation on stepping. Paired tests in the individual rats also showed no effect in 7/8 rats and minor effects in the last rat, within the group's variance.
    


          Comparison with existing methods:
        
      
      Our method allows interaction with rats at the pelvis without any perturbation of normal stepping in the intact rat. The method bypasses slings, and cuffs, avoiding cuff or slings squeezing the abdomen, or other altered sensory feedback. Our implant osseointegrates, and thus allows an efficient high bandwidth mechanical coupling to a robot. The implants support quadrupedal training and are readily integrated into either treadmill or overground contexts.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our novel device and procedures support a range of novel experimental designs and motor tests for rehabilitative and augmentation devices in intact and SCI model rats, with the advantage of allowing direct force application at the pelvic bones.",0
821,Minimally Invasive Versus Open Distal Pancreatectomy (LEOPARD): A Multicenter Patient-blinded Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective:
        
      
      This trial followed a structured nationwide training program in minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP), according to the IDEAL framework for surgical innovation, and aimed to compare time to functional recovery after minimally invasive and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP).
    


          Background:
        
      
      MIDP is increasingly used and may enhance postoperative recovery as compared with ODP, but randomized studies are lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicenter patient-blinded randomized controlled superiority trial was performed in 14 centers between April 2015 and March 2017. Adult patients with left-sided pancreatic tumors confined to the pancreas without vascular involvement were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo MIDP or ODP. Patients were blinded for type of surgery using a large abdominal dressing. The primary endpoint was time to functional recovery. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5689).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Time to functional recovery was 4 days [interquartile range (IQR) 3-6) in 51 patients after MIDP versus 6 days (IQR 5-8) in 57 patients after ODP (P < 0.001). The conversion rate of MIDP was 8%. Operative blood loss was less after MIDP (150 vs 400 mL; P < 0.001), whereas operative time was longer (217 vs 179 minutes; P = 0.005). The Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III complication rate was 25% versus 38% (P = 0.21). Delayed gastric emptying grade B/C was seen less often after MIDP (6% vs 20%; P = 0.04). Postoperative pancreatic fistulas grade B/C were seen in 39% after MIDP versus 23% after ODP (P = 0.07), without difference in percutaneous catheter drainage (22% vs 20%; P = 0.77). Quality of life (day 3-30) was better after MIDP as compared with ODP, and overall costs were non-significantly less after MIDP. No 90-day mortality was seen after MIDP versus 2% (n = 1) after ODP.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with left-sided pancreatic tumors confined to the pancreas, MIDP reduces time to functional recovery compared with ODP. Although the overall rate of complications was not reduced, MIDP was associated with less delayed gastric emptying and better quality of life without increasing costs.",2
822,Implementation and outcome of minor and major minimally invasive liver surgery in the Netherlands,"Background:
        
      
      While most of the evidence on minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) is derived from expert centers, nationwide outcomes remain underreported. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation and outcome of MILS on a nationwide scale.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Electronic patient files were reviewed in all Dutch liver surgery centers and all patients undergoing MILS between 2011 and 2016 were selected. Operative outcomes were stratified based on extent of the resection and annual MILS volume.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 6951 liver resections were included, with a median annual volume of 50 resections per center. The overall use of MILS was 13% (n = 916), which varied from 3% to 36% (P < 0.001) between centers. The nationwide use of MILS increased from 6% in 2011 to 23% in 2016 (P < 0.001). Outcomes of minor MILS were comparable with international studies (conversion 0-13%, mortality <1%). In centers which performed ≥20 MILS annually, major MILS was associated with less conversions (14 (11%) versus 41 (30%), P < 0.001), shorter operating time (184 (117-239) versus 200 (139-308) minutes, P = 0.010), and less overall complications (37 (30%) versus 58 (42%), P = 0.040).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The nationwide use of MILS is increasing, although large variation remains between centers. Outcomes of major MILS are better in centers with higher volumes.",9
823,Robotic approach to the liver: Open surgery in a closed abdomen or laparoscopic surgery with technical constraints?,"The application of the minimally invasive approach has shown to be safe and effective for liver surgery and is in constant growth. The indications for laparoscopic surgery are steadily increasing across the field. In the early 2000s, robotic surgery led to some additional improvements, such as tremor filtration, instrument stability, 3D view and more comfort for the surgeon. These techniques bring in some advantages compared to the traditional OLR: less blood loss, shorter admissions, fewer adhesions, and a faster postoperative recovery and better outcomes in case of further hepatectomy for tumor recurrence has been shown. Concerning which is the best minimally invasive approach between laparoscopic and robotic surgery, the evidence is still conflicting. The latter shows good potential, since the endo-wristed instruments work similarly to the surgeon's hands, even with an intact abdominal wall. However, the technique is still under development, burdened by important costs, and limited by the lack of some instruments available for the laparoscopic approach. The paucity of universally accepted and proven data, especially concerning long-term outcomes, hampers drawing univocal acceptance at present. Furthermore, the number of variables related both to the patient and the disease further complicates the decision leading to a treatment tailored to each patient with strict selection. This review aims to explore the main differences between laparoscopic and robotic surgery, focusing on indications, operative technique and current debated clinical issues in recent literature.",1
824,Augmented Reality: Moving Robotics Forward,"Compared with other fields, adoption of robotics in colorectal surgery remains relatively slow. One of the reasons for this is that the expected benefits of robotics, such as greater accuracy, speed, and better patient outcomes, are not born out in evidence comparing use of robotics for colorectal procedures to conventional laparoscopy. But evidence also suggests that outcomes with colorectal robotic procedures depend on the experience of the surgeon, suggesting that a steep learning curve is acting as a barrier to the benefits of robotics being realized. In this paper, we analyze exactly why surgeon skill and proficiency is such a critical factor in colorectal surgery, especially around the most complex procedures associated with cancer. Shortening of the learning curve is crucial for both the adoption of the technique and the efficient use of expert trainers. Looking beyond the basics of training and embracing a new generation of digital learning technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration and development beyond the confines of individual institutions may be an important contributor to achieve these goals in the future.",3
825,A Review of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Transformed Health Ecosystems,"Health care is shifting toward become proactive according to the concept of P5 medicine-a predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory and precision discipline. This patient-centered care heavily leverages the latest technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics that support diagnosis, decision making and treatment. In this paper, we present the role of AI and robotic systems in this evolution, including example use cases. We categorize systems along multiple dimensions such as the type of system, the degree of autonomy, the care setting where the systems are applied, and the application area. These technologies have already achieved notable results in the prediction of sepsis or cardiovascular risk, the monitoring of vital parameters in intensive care units, or in the form of home care robots. Still, while much research is conducted around AI and robotics in health care, adoption in real world care settings is still limited. To remove adoption barriers, we need to address issues such as safety, security, privacy and ethical principles; detect and eliminate bias that could result in harmful or unfair clinical decisions; and build trust in and societal acceptance of AI.",0

827,European expert consensus on a structured approach to training robotic-assisted low anterior resection using performance metrics,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim was to develop and operationally define 'performance metrics' that characterize a reference approach to robotic-assisted low anterior resection (RA-LAR) and to obtain face and content validity through a consensus meeting.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Three senior colorectal surgeons with robotic experience and a senior behavioural scientist formed the Metrics Group. We used published guidelines, training materials, manufacturers' instructions and unedited videos of RA-LAR to deconstruct the operation into defined, measurable components - performance metrics (i.e. procedure phases, steps, errors and critical errors). The performance metrics were then subjected to detailed critique by 18 expert colorectal surgeons in a modified Delphi process.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Performance metrics for RA-LAR had 15 procedure phases, 128 steps, 89 errors and 117 critical errors in women, 88 errors and 118 critical errors in men. After the modified Delphi process the final performance metrics consisted of 14 procedure phases, 129 steps, 88 errors and 115 critical errors in women, 87 errors and 116 critical errors in men. After discussion by the Delphi panel, all procedure phases received unanimous consensus apart from phase I (patient positioning and preparation, 83%) and phase IV (docking, 94%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A robotic rectal operation can be broken down into procedure phases, steps, with errors and critical errors, known as performance metrics. The face and content of these metrics have been validated by a large group of expert robotic colorectal surgeons from Europe. We consider the metrics essential for the development of a structured training curriculum and standardized procedural assessment for RA-LAR.",3
828,401 consecutive minimally invasive distal pancreatectomies: lessons learned from 20 years of experience,"Background:
        
      
      This study aimed to discuss and report the trend, outcomes, and learning curve effect after minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) at two high-volume centres.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients undergoing MIDP between January 1999 and December 2018 were retrospectively identified from prospectively maintained electronic databases. The entire cohort was divided into two groups constituting the ""early"" and ""recent"" phases. The learning curve effect was analyzed for laparoscopic (LDP) and robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP). The follow-up was at least 2 years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study population included 401 consecutive patients (LDP n = 300, RDP n = 101). Twelve surgeons performed MIDP during the study period. Although patients were more carefully selected in the early phase, in terms of median age (49 vs. 55 years, p = 0.026), ASA class higher than 2 (3% vs. 9%, p = 0.018), previous abdominal surgery (10% vs. 34%, p < 0.001), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (7% vs. 15%, p = 0.017), the recent phase had similar perioperative outcomes. The increase of experience in LDP was inversely associated with the operative time (240 vs 210 min, p < 0.001), morbidity rate (56.5% vs. 40.1%, p = 0.005), intra-abdominal collection (28.3% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.023), and length of stay (8 vs. 7 days, p = 0.009). Median survival in the PDAC subgroup was 53 months.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the setting of high-volume centres, the surgical training of MIDP is associated with acceptable rates of morbidity. The learning curve can be largely achieved by several team members, improving outcomes over time. Whenever possible resection of PDAC guarantees adequate oncological results and survival.",9
829,Determination of biometric measures to evaluate patient suitability for transoral robotic surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) represents a novel treatment for oropharyngeal cancer and obstructive sleep apnea. Appropriate patient selection is crucial. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether anatomic biometric measures are useful to determine the feasibility of performing TORS.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Three surgeons independently evaluated feasibility in 51 soft-fix cadavers. Transoral visualization was performed with 2 retractors commonly used in TORS. Seven anthropometric parameters and the degree of mouth opening were recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mandibular body height, hyoid-mental length, and neck circumference demonstrated significant differences between ""suboptimal"" and ""adequate"" visualization of base of tongue and epiglottis (p < .05). Limited mouth opening was associated with suboptimal visualization. Neck circumference had the strongest influence on predicting TORS feasibility.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Mandibular body height, hyoid-mental length, and neck circumference in conjunction with the degree of mouth opening may determine patient suitability for TORS. Clinical evaluation is essential to validate their collective usefulness.",1
830,Neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: outcomes from 500 consecutive cases in the UK,"The purpose is to report the United Kingdom's largest single-centre experience of robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP), using the neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section (NeuroSAFE) technique. We describe the utilisation and outcomes of this technique. This is a retrospective study from 2012 to 2019 on 520 patients undergoing NeuroSAFE RALP at our Institution. Our Institution's database was analysed for false-positive frozen-section (FS) margins as confirmed on paraffin histopathological analysis: functional outcomes of potency, continence, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). The median (range) of console time was 145 (90-300) min. In our cohort, positive FS was seen in 30.7% (160/520) of patients, with a confirmatory paraffin analysis in 91.8% of our patients' cohort (147/160). The neurovascular bundles (NVBs) that underwent secondary resection contained tumour in 26.8% (43/160) of the cases. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was 6.7% (35/520), of which FS was positive in 40% (14/35) of those cases. There were insufficient evidence of a statistical association of urinary incontinence and positive surgical margin rates according to NS or NVB resection. NeuroSAFE enables intraoperative confirmation of the oncologic safety of a NS procedure. Patients with a positive FS on NeuroSAFE can be converted to a negative surgical margin (NSM) by ipsilateral wide resection. This spared 1 in 4 men from positive margins posterolaterally in our series. Limitations are the absence of a matched contemporary cohort of NS RALP without NeuroSAFE in our centre.",2
831,Haptic-based neurorehabilitation in poststroke patients: a feasibility prospective multicentre trial for robotics hand rehabilitation,"Background. Haptic robots allow the exploitation of known motor learning mechanisms, representing a valuable option for motor treatment after stroke. The aim of this feasibility multicentre study was to test the clinical efficacy of a haptic prototype, for the recovery of hand function after stroke. Methods. A prospective pilot clinical trial was planned on 15 consecutive patients enrolled in 3 rehabilitation centre in Italy. All the framework features of the haptic robot (e.g., control loop, external communication, and graphic rendering for virtual reality) were implemented into a real-time MATLAB/Simulink environment, controlling a five-bar linkage able to provide forces up to 20 [N] at the end effector, used for finger and hand rehabilitation therapies. Clinical (i.e., Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scale; nine hold pegboard test) and kinematics (i.e., time; velocity; jerk metric; normalized jerk of standard movements) outcomes were assessed before and after treatment to detect changes in patients' motor performance. Reorganization of cortical activation was detected in one patient by fMRI. Results and Conclusions. All patients showed significant improvements in both clinical and kinematic outcomes. Additionally, fMRI results suggest that the proposed approach may promote a better cortical activation in the brain.",2
832,Robotic-assisted versus open pancreaticoduodenectomy for patients with benign and malignant periampullary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of short-term outcomes,"Background:
        
      
      Although several non-randomized studies comparing robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) and open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) recently demonstrated that the two operative techniques could be equivalent in terms of safety outcomes and short-term oncologic efficacy, no definitive answer has arrived yet to the question as to whether robotic assistance can contribute to reducing the high rate of postoperative morbidity.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE databases. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing RPD and OPD as surgical treatment for periampullary benign and malignant lesions were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis with no limits of language or year of publication.
    


          Results:
        
      
      18 non-randomized studies were included for quantitative synthesis with 13,639 patients allocated to RPD (n = 1593) or OPD (n = 12,046). RPD and OPD showed equivalent results in terms of mortality (3.3% vs 2.8%; P = 0.84), morbidity (64.4% vs 68.1%; P = 0.12), pancreatic fistula (17.9% vs 15.9%; P = 0.81), delayed gastric emptying (16.8% vs 16.1%; P = 0.98), hemorrhage (11% vs 14.6%; P = 0.43), and bile leak (5.1% vs 3.5%; P = 0.35). Estimated intra-operative blood loss was significantly lower in the RPD group (352.1 ± 174.1 vs 588.4 ± 219.4; P = 0.0003), whereas operative time was significantly longer for RPD compared to OPD (461.1 ± 84 vs 384.2 ± 73.8; P = 0.0004). RPD and OPD showed equivalent results in terms of retrieved lymph nodes (19.1 ± 9.9 vs 17.3 ± 9.9; P = 0.22) and positive margin status (13.3% vs 16.1%; P = 0.32).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RPD is safe and feasible as surgical treatment for malignant or benign disease of the pancreatic head and the periampullary region. Equivalency in terms of surgical radicality including R0 curative resection and number of harvested lymph nodes between the two groups confirmed the reliability of RPD from an oncologic point of view.",2
833,Minimally Invasive versus Open Distal Pancreatectomy for Ductal Adenocarcinoma (DIPLOMA): A Pan-European Propensity Score Matched Study,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to compare oncological outcomes after minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) with open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Cohort studies have suggested superior short-term outcomes of MIDP vs. ODP. Recent international surveys, however, revealed that surgeons have concerns about the oncological outcomes of MIDP for PDAC.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a pan-European propensity score matched study including patients who underwent MIDP (laparoscopic or robot-assisted) or ODP for PDAC between January 1, 2007 and July 1, 2015. MIDP patients were matched to ODP patients in a 1:1 ratio. Main outcomes were radical (R0) resection, lymph node retrieval, and survival.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 1212 patients were included from 34 centers in 11 countries. Of 356 (29%) MIDP patients, 340 could be matched. After matching, the MIDP conversion rate was 19% (n = 62). Median blood loss [200 mL (60-400) vs 300 mL (150-500), P = 0.001] and hospital stay [8 (6-12) vs 9 (7-14) days, P < 0.001] were lower after MIDP. Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 complications (18% vs 21%, P = 0.431) and 90-day mortality (2% vs 3%, P > 0.99) were comparable for MIDP and ODP, respectively. R0 resection rate was higher (67% vs 58%, P = 0.019), whereas Gerota's fascia resection (31% vs 60%, P < 0.001) and lymph node retrieval [14 (8-22) vs 22 (14-31), P < 0.001] were lower after MIDP. Median overall survival was 28 [95% confidence interval (CI), 22-34] versus 31 (95% CI, 26-36) months (P = 0.929).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Comparable survival was seen after MIDP and ODP for PDAC, but the opposing differences in R0 resection rate, resection of Gerota's fascia, and lymph node retrieval strengthen the need for a randomized trial to confirm the oncological safety of MIDP.",9
834,Are customers happy with robot service? Investigating satisfaction with robot service restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 virus has led to a rapid increase in demand for robot service restaurants. However, given the novelty of both, little is known regarding the impact of this technology on consumer attitudes in the time of the pandemic. Using a sample of customers with dining experiences in Muscat-based robot service restaurants, the current study investigates the factors that affect experience satisfaction and experience extension. The results demonstrate that perceived usefulness, speed of service, and experience novelty directly influence experience satisfaction, while perceived enjoyment and experience satisfaction directly influence experience extension. Moreover, novelty seeking moderates the effects of experience novelty and perceived enjoyment on experience satisfaction, as well as the impact of perceived enjoyment on experience extension. Lastly, perceived risk reduction of infection and trust are found to moderate the impact of experience satisfaction on experience extension. Theoretical and practical implications are offered.",7
835,Propensity-score-matched comparison of soft tissue surgical margins status between open and robotic-assisted radical cystectomy,"Introduction:
        
      
      The use of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is becoming more widespread. While its safety is accepted, its oncological efficacy as compared to the current standard, open radical cystectomy (ORC), remains debatable.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      The aim of this study is to compare the rates of positive soft tissue surgical margins (STSM), between patients treated with RARC or ORC, using a large contemporaneous collaborative database. We included 2,536 patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder treated at 26 institutions. A propensity-score matching 1:1 was performed with 3 ORC patients matched to 1 RARC patient. The final cohort included 1,614 patients. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses tested the impact of surgical technique on STSM status, before and after propensity-score matching.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 870 (34%) patients underwent RARC and 1,666 (66%) ORC. The overall STSM rate was 11%; 10% in the ORC group and 13% in the RARC group. Within the propensity-score-matched cohort, the positive STSM rate were 14% and 13% in the ORC and RARC group, respectively (P = 0.1). In multivariable analysis, after propensity match RARC approach was not associated with the risk of a positive STSM (P = 0.1). These results were confirmed in the subgroup of patients with pathologic non-organ-confined or organ-confined diseases.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While treatment with RARC is associated with a higher absolute rate of STSM, the difference did not remain after adjustment for the effects of other established prognostic factors. Results from ongoing trials are awaited to assess the validity of these findings.",2
836,Optimus Primed: Media Cultivation of Robot Mental Models and Social Judgments,"Media influence people's perceptions of reality broadly and of technology in particular. Robot villains and heroes-from Ultron to Wall-E-have been shown to serve a specific cultivation function, shaping people's perceptions of those embodied social technologies, especially when individuals do not have direct experience with them. To date, however, little is understood about the nature of the conceptions people hold for what robots are, how they work, and how they may function in society, as well as the media antecedents and relational effects of those cognitive structures. This study takes a step toward bridging that gap by exploring relationships among individuals' recall of robot characters from popular media, their mental models for actual robots, and social evaluations of an actual robot. Findings indicate that mental models consist of a small set of common and tightly linked components (beyond which there is a good deal of individual difference), but robot character recall and evaluation have little association with whether people hold any of those components. Instead, data are interpreted to suggest that cumulative sympathetic evaluations of robot media characters may form heuristics that are primed by and engaged in social evaluations of actual robots, while technical content in mental models is associated with a more utilitarian approach to actual robots.",7
837,The Sense of Commitment in Human-Robot Interaction,"The sense of commitment is a fundamental building block of human social life. By generating and/or stabilizing expectations about contributions that individual agents will make to the goals of other agents or to shared goals, a sense of commitment can facilitate the planning and coordination of actions involving multiple agents. Moreover, it can also increase individual agents' motivation to contribute to other agents' goals or to shared goals, as well as their willingness to rely on other agents' contributions. In this paper, we provide a starting point for designing robots that exhibit and/or elicit a sense of commitment. We identify several challenges that such a project would likely confront, and consider possibilities for meeting these challenges.",0

840,Gaze Contingent Cartesian Control of a Robotic Arm for Laparoscopic Surgery,"This paper introduces a gaze contingent controlled robotic arm for laparoscopic surgery, based on gaze gestures. The method offers a natural and seamless communication channel between the surgeon and the robotic laparoscope. It offers several advantages in terms of reducing on-screen clutter and efficiently conveying visual intention. The proposed hands-free system enables the surgeon to be part of the robot control feedback loop, allowing user-friendly camera panning and zooming. The proposed platform avoids the limitations of using dwell-time camera control in previous gaze contingent camera control methods. The system represents a true hands-free setup without the need of obtrusive sensors mounted on the surgeon or the use of a foot pedal. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used for real-time gaze gesture recognition. This method was evaluated with a cohort of 11 subjects by using the proposed system to complete a modified upper gastrointestinal staging laparoscopy and biopsy task on a phantom box trainer, with results demonstrating the potential clinical value of the proposed system.",1
841,Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Based Orientation Control of an Intra-operative Ultrasound Robot,"Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a miniatured intra-operative ultrasound system, widely used in routine diagnosis and interventional procedure monitoring, to assess cardiac structures and functions. As a way to assist the operation of TEE remotely, we have developed an add-on robotic system to actuate a commercial TEE probe. For the proposed robot, understanding the inverse kinematics (IK) which relates the probe pose to the joint parameters is the fundamental step towards automatic control of the system. Rather than using conventional numerical-based techniques which may have problems with speed, convergence, and stability when applying to the TEE robot, this paper explores a soft computing approach by constructing an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to learn from training data generated by the forward kinematics (FK) and then computing the inverse kinematics in order to control the orientation of the TEE probe. With 1900 training data over 40 epochs, the minimum training error for each joint parameter was found to be less than 0.1 degree. Validation using a separate data set has indicated that the maximum error was less than 0.3 degree for each joint parameter. It is therefore concluded that the ANFIS-based approach is an effective way, with acceptable accuracy, to compute the inverse kinematics of the TEE robot.",0
842,Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Biopsy Approaches,"Prostate cancer is a common and increasing malignancy in men. Tissue is generally obtained using prostate biopsy for diagnosis and risk stratification. There are many prostate biopsy techniques. Historically, the transrectal approach has been the most adopted. In many centers, however, there has a been a shift towards transperineal prostate biopsies, increasingly performed under local anesthetic. The transperineal approach has proven advantages, including better sampling of the anterior area of the prostate and lower infection rates. Biopsies are typically performed using a combination of a systematic and targeted approach. Targeting of lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging can be performed cognitively, assisted by a fused imaging approach with the transrectal ultrasound, or directly within the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. There are several novel developments in the field, which include robotic techniques to guide biopsy needles based on fusion images or directly targeting lesions robotically during in-bore magnetic resonance imaging.",1
843,Role of robotic approach in ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA): A systematic review of the literature,"Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become standard surgical treatment of choice in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in which the medical management fails. Despite the wide use of laparoscopic method, the enhanced and innovative features that come with the robotic platform, such as endo-wrist technology, 3D visualization, surgeon-controlled camera and motion scaling, make it an appealing choice. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and safety of robotic approach for proctectomy or proctocolectomy with IPAA as compared to conventional laparoscopic approach. A systematic review was completed for studies done between 2010 and 2022 comparing the robotic approach with the laparoscopic approach. Nine studies were found to be feasible to be included in this review. In terms of the outcomes, although the mean operating time was slightly higher than the laparoscopic approach, the other outcomes, such as mean blood loss, return of the bowel movement, mean hospital stay, and conversion to open, were found to be significantly lower in the robotic approach as compared to both laparoscopic and conventional open techniques. Despite the overall increased rate of complications combined from all the studies, the rate of significant complications such as anastomotic leaks requiring readmission and return to theater was also found to be substantially less. This study concludes that although robotic approach is in its initial stages for pelvic surgeries, it can be safely employed due to improved dexterity and visibility.",1
844,Trusting social robots,"In this paper, I argue that we need a more robust account of our ability and willingness to trust social robots. I motivate my argument by demonstrating that existing accounts of trust and of trusting social robots are inadequate. I identify that it is the feature of a façade or deception inherent in our engagement with social robots that both facilitates, and is in danger of undermining, trust. Finally, I utilise the fictional dualism model of social robots to clarify that trust in social robots, unlike trust in humans, must rely on an independent judgement of product reliability.",4
845,Recommendations for a standardised educational program in robot assisted gynaecological surgery: Consensus from the Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery (SERGS),"Background:
        
      
      The Society of European Robotic Gynaecological Surgery (SERGS) aims at developing a European consensus on core components of a curriculum for training and assessment in robot assisted gynaecological surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A Delphi process was initiated among a panel of 12 experts in robot assisted surgery invited through the SERGS. An online questionnaire survey was based on a literature search for standards in education in gynaecological robot assisted surgery. The survey was performed in three consecutive rounds to reach optimal consensus. The results of this survey were discussed by the panel and led to consensus recommendations on 39 issues, adhering to general principles of medical education.
    


          Results:
        
      
      On review there appeared to be no accredited training programs in Europe, and few in the USA. Recommendations for requirements of training centres, educational tools and assessment of proficiency varied widely. Stepwise and structured training together with validated assessment based on competencies rather than on volume emerged as prerequisites for adequate and safe learning. An appropriate educational environment and tools for training were defined. Although certification should be competence based, the panel recommended additional volume based criteria for both accreditation of training centres and certification of individual surgeons.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Consensus was reached on minimum criteria for training in robot assisted gynaecological surgery. To transfer results into clinical practice, experts recommended a curriculum and guidelines that have now been endorsed by SERGS to be used to establish training programmes for robot assisted surgery.",3
846,Open Versus Laparoscopic Versus Robotic Versus Transanal Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare techniques for rectal cancer resection.
    


          Summary background data:
        
      
      Different surgical approaches exist for mesorectal excision.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Systematic literature review and Bayesian network meta-analysis performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials included, reporting on 6237 participants, comparing: open versus laparoscopic versus robotic versus transanal mesorectal excision. No significant differences identified between treatments in intraoperative morbidity, conversion rate, grade III/IV morbidity, reoperation, anastomotic leak, nodes retrieved, involved distal margin, 5-year overall survival, and locoregional recurrence. Operative blood loss was less with laparoscopic surgery compared with open, and with robotic surgery compared with open and laparoscopic. Robotic operative time was longer compared with open, laparoscopic, and transanal. Laparoscopic operative time was longer compared with open. Laparoscopic surgery resulted in lower overall postoperative morbidity and fewer wound infections compared with open. Robotic surgery had fewer wound infections compared with open. Time to defecation was longer with open surgery compared with laparoscopic and robotic. Hospital stay was longer after open surgery compared with laparoscopic and robotic, and after laparoscopic surgery compared with robotic. Laparoscopic surgery resulted in more incomplete or nearly complete mesorectal excisions compared with open, and in more involved circumferential resection margins compared with transanal. Robotic surgery resulted in longer distal resection margins compared with open, laparoscopic, and transanal.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The different techniques result in comparable perioperative morbidity and long-term survival. The laparoscopic and robotic approaches may improve postoperative recovery, and the open and transanal approaches may improve oncological resection. Technique selection should be based on expected benefits by individual patient.",9
847,"WATER: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial of Aquablation® vs Transurethral Resection of the Prostate in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia","Purpose:
        
      
      We compared the safety and efficacy of Aquablation and transurethral prostate resection for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In a double-blind, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial 181 patients with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent transurethral prostate resection or Aquablation. The primary efficacy end point was the reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score at 6 months. The primary safety end point was the development of Clavien-Dindo persistent grade 1, or 2 or higher operative complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Mean total operative time was similar for Aquablation and transurethral prostate resection (33 vs 36 minutes, p = 0.2752) but resection time was lower for Aquablation (4 vs 27 minutes, p <0.0001). At month 6 patients treated with Aquablation and transurethral prostate resection experienced large I-PSS improvements. The prespecified study noninferiority hypothesis was satisfied (p <0.0001). Of the patients who underwent Aquablation and transurethral prostate resection 26% and 42%, respectively, experienced a primary safety end point, which met the study primary noninferiority safety hypothesis and subsequently demonstrated superiority (p = 0.0149). Among sexually active men the rate of anejaculation was lower in those treated with Aquablation (10% vs 36%, p = 0.0003).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Surgical prostate resection using Aquablation showed noninferior symptom relief compared to transurethral prostate resection but with a lower risk of sexual dysfunction. Larger prostates (50 to 80 ml) demonstrated a more pronounced superior safety and efficacy benefit. Longer term followup would help assess the clinical value of Aquablation.",5
848,Improved joint line and posterior offset restoration in primary total knee replacement using a robotic-assisted surgical technique: An international multi-centre retrospective analysis of matched cohorts,"Background:
        
      
      Accurate restoration of joint line height and posterior offset in primary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) have been shown to be important factors in post-operative range of movement and function. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of joint line and posterior offset restoration in a group of patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA (raTKA). A matched cohort of patients that underwent a TKA using a conventional jig-based technique was assessed for comparison. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between groups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 120 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis that received a TKA using the Navio Surgical System (n = 60), or Conventional manual TKA (n = 60). Procedures were performed between 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2019 at six different centres. Joint line height and posterior offset was measured pre-operatively and post-operatively on calibrated weight bearing plain radiographs of the knee. Two observers performed measurements using validated measuring tools. A BMI and age-matched cohort of patients that underwent TKA using a conventional technique in the same six centres were assessed for comparison. Mean values, standard deviations and confidence intervals are presented for change and absolute change in joint line height and posterior offset. Student's t-test was used to compare the changes between techniques.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients that underwent robotic-assisted TKA had joint line height and posterior offset restored more accurately than patients undergoing TKA using a conventional technique. Average change from pre-operative measurement in joint line height using raTKA was -0.38mm [95% CI: -0.79 to 0.03] vs 0.91 [0.14 to 1.68] with the conventional technique. Average absolute change in joint line height using raTKA was 1.96mm [1.74 to 2.18] vs 4.00mm [3.68 to 4.32] with the conventional technique. Average change in posterior offset using raTKA was 0.08mm [-0.40 to 0.56] vs 1.64mm [2.47 to 0.81] with the conventional technique. Average absolute change in posterior offset with raTKA was 2.19mm [1.92 to 2.46] vs 4.24mm [3.79 to 4.69] with the conventional technique. There was a significant difference when comparing absolute change in joint line height and posterior offset between groups (p<0.01).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted primary TKA restores the joint line height and posterior offset more accurately than conventional jig-based techniques.",8
849,Robotic-assisted vs. open radical prostatectomy: A machine learning framework for intelligent analysis of patient-reported outcomes from online cancer support groups,"Background:
        
      
      The advantages of Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RARP) over open radical prostatectomy (ORP) in Prostate cancer perioperatively are well-established, but quality of life is more contentious. Increasingly, patients are utilising online cancer support groups (OCSG) to express themselves. Currently there is no method of analysis of these sophisticated data sources. We have used the PRIME-2 (Patient Reported Information Multidimensional Exploration version 2) framework for automated identification and intelligent analysis of decision-making, functional and emotional outcomes in men undergoing ORP vs. RARP from OCSG discussions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The PRIME-2 framework was developed to retrospectively analyse individualised patient-reported information from 5,157 patients undergoing RARP and 579 ORP. The decision factors, side effects, and emotions in 2 groups were analysed and compared using Chi-squared, t tests, and Pearson correlation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no differences in Gleason score, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), and age between the groups. Surgeon experience and preservation of erectile function (P < 0.01) were important factors in the decision making process. There were no significant differences in urinary, sexual, or bowel symptoms between ORP and RARP on a monthly basis during the initial 12 months. Emotions expressed by patients undergoing RARP were more consistent and positive while ORP expressed more negative emotions at the time of surgery and 3 months postsurgery (P < 0.05), due to pain and discomfort, and during ninth month due to fear and anxiety of pending PSA tests.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      ORP and RARP demonstrated similar side effect profiles for 12 months, but PRIME-2 enables identification of important quality of life features and emotions over time. It is timely for clinicians to accept OCSG as an adjunct to Prostate cancer care.",4
850,Experiences of patients who had a stroke and rehabilitation professionals with upper limb rehabilitation robots: a qualitative systematic review protocol,"Introduction:
        
      
      Emerging evidence suggests that robotic devices for upper limb rehabilitation after a stroke may improve upper limb function. For robotic upper limb rehabilitation in stroke to be successful, patients' experiences and those of the rehabilitation professionals must be considered. Therefore, this review aims to synthesise the available evidence on experiences of patients after a stroke with rehabilitation robots for upper limb rehabilitation and the experiences of rehabilitation professionals with rehabilitation robots for upper limb stroke rehabilitation.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      Database search will include MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE and CINAHL (EBSCOhost). Grey literature from Open Grey, PsyArXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv and Google Scholar will also be searched. Qualitative studies or results from mixed-method studies that include adult patients after a stroke who use upper limb rehabilitation robots, either supervised by rehabilitation professionals or by patients themselves, at any stage of their rehabilitation and/or stroke professionals who use upper limb rehabilitation robots will be included. Robotic upper limb rehabilitation provided by students, healthcare assistants, technicians, non-professional caregivers, family caregivers, volunteer caregivers or other informal caregivers will be excluded. Articles published in English will be considered regardless of date of publication. Studies will be screened and critically appraised for methodological quality by two independent reviewers. A standardised tool from JBI System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information for data extraction, the meta-aggregation approach for data synthesis and the ConQual approach for confidence evaluation will be followed.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      As this systematic review is based on previously published research, no informed consent or ethical approval is required. It is anticipated that this systematic review will highlight the experiences of patients after a stroke and perceived facilitators and barriers for rehabilitation professionals on this topic, which will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and national and international conferences.

851,Robotic versus open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in adults,"Background:
        
      
      It has been suggested that in comparison with open radical cystectomy, robotic-assisted radical cystectomy results in less blood loss, shorter convalescence, and fewer complications with equivalent short-term oncological and functional outcomes; however, uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of these benefits.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effects of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in adults with bladder cancer.
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      Review authors conducted a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status for studies comparing open radical cystectomy and robotic-assisted radical cystectomy. The date of the last search was 1 July 2018 for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1999 to July 2018), PubMed Embase (1999 to July 2018), Web of Science (1999 to July 2018), Cancer Research UK (www.cancerresearchuk.org/), and the Institute of Cancer Research (www.icr.ac.uk/). We searched the following trials registers: ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/), BioMed Central International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry (www.isrctn.com), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.
    


          Selection criteria:
        
      
      We searched for randomised controlled trials that compared robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with open radical cystectomy (ORC).
    


          Data collection and analysis:
        
      
      This study was based on a published protocol. Primary outcomes of the review were recurrence-free survival and major postoperative complications (class III to V). Secondary outcomes were minor postoperative complications (class I and II), transfusion requirement, length of hospital stay (days), quality of life, and positive margins (%). Three review authors independently assessed relevant titles and abstracts of records identified by the literature search to determine which studies should be assessed further. Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse the data.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      We included in the review five randomised controlled trials comprising a total of 541 participants. Total numbers of participants included in the ORC and RARC cohorts were 270 and 271, respectively.Primary outomesTime-to-recurrence: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in a similar time to recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.43); 2 trials; low-certainty evidence). In absolute terms at 5 years of follow-up, this corresponds to 16 more recurrences per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 123 more) with 431 recurrences per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Major complications (Clavien grades 3 to 5): Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar rates of major complications (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48); 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 11 more major complications per 1000 participants (95% CI 44 fewer to 89 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Secondary outcomesMinor complications (Clavien grades 1 and 2): We are very uncertain whether robotic cystectomy may reduce minor complications (very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and for very serious imprecision.Transfusion rate: Robotic cystectomy probably results in substantially fewer transfusions than open cystectomy (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 193 fewer transfusions per 1000 participants (95% CI 262 fewer to 92 fewer) based on 460 transfusion per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations.Hospital stay: Robotic cystectomy may result in a slightly shorter hospital stay than open cystectomy (mean difference (MD) -0.67, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.12); 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Quality of life: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in a similar quality of life (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.08, 95% CI 0.32 lower to 0.16 higher; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Positive margin rates: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar positive margin rates (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.40; 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 8 more (95% CI 21 fewer to 67 more) positive margins per 1000 participants based on 48 positive margins per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.
    


          Authors' conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may have similar outcomes with regard to time to recurrence, rates of major complications, quality of life, and positive margin rates (all low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether the robotic approach reduces rates of minor complications (very low-certainty evidence), although it probably reduces the risk of blood transfusions substantially (moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce hospital stay slightly (low-certainty evidence). We were unable to conduct any of the preplanned subgroup analyses to assess the impact of patient age, pathological stage, body habitus, or surgeon expertise on outcomes. This review did not address issues of cost-effectiveness.",2
852,The midterm outcome and MACE of robotically enhanced grafting of left anterior descending artery with left internal mammary artery,"Background:
        
      
      We assessed the midterm outcome and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in UK's largest Da Vinci assisted robotic coronary revascularisation cohort. This study was set up at the Imperial College NHS Trust, St. Mary's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Benchmarking approach through retrospective audit of the regional outcomes against standards in the published literature. Data was collected from the patient's records, communication with the primary care physicians and the national strategic tracing service. The results were compared with the published literature. Patients who underwent robotic assisted coronary revascularisation were included. Other robotic procedures or minimally invasive revascularisation without the use of the Da Vinci robot were excluded. The main outcome measure was the midterm survival up to five years and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) up to three years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Since April 2002, one hundred consecutive patients underwent either off pump robotic assisted single vessel small thoracotomy (SVST, n=88), or off pump total endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (TCAB, n=12). All patients were operated on by the same primary surgeon but different assisting surgeons. All patients received a left internal mammary arterial (LIMA) graft as planned. The primary outcome of total one month and three years MACE and up to five year survival was 0, 9 and 96% respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The procedural success rates in terms of morbidity and mortality up to five years are compatible to the outcomes observed outside the United Kingdom. These results are not inferior to that of conventional off pump single vessel coronary surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention to the LAD.",2

854,Transoral robotic surgery and neck dissection alone for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Influence of resection margins on oncological outcomes,"Objectives:
        
      
      This study reports oncological outcomes of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and neck dissection (ND) alone for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and aims to analyse the influence of resection margins on local recurrence rates.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Fifty-one patients treated with curative intent for HNSCC, with TORS and ND alone between 2013 and 2019 at two tertiary centres were included in this observational multi-centre prospective cohort study. Oncological outcomes are reported on 47 patients for whom the aim was to treat with TORS and ND alone; this excluded four patients who were recommended adjuvant radiotherapy based on resective pathology but did not receive treatment. Local control is the primary endpoint; disease specific, progression free and overall survival are secondary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      With a median follow up of 43 months, estimated outcomes at 3 years (n = 47) were as follows: local control 92%, progression free survival 80%, disease specific survival 94%, and overall survival 84%. Presence of a positive margin on the main specimen was the only statistically significant predictor of local recurrence on univariate Cox regression analysis. Time dependent receiver operating characteristic curve identified margins of 1.1 mm as a threshold for local control, with area under the curve 0.788 (95% CI 0.616-0.960), indicating a good classifier.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This is the first UK surgery alone series reporting mature oncological outcomes following TORS and ND. Positive margins on the resected specimen are the strongest predictor of local recurrence, with conventional definitions of ""close margins"" having no impact.",1
855,Impact of a Nationwide Training Program in Minimally Invasive Distal Pancreatectomy (LAELAPS),"Objective:
        
      
      To study the feasibility and impact of a nationwide training program in minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP).
    


          Summary of background data:
        
      
      Superior outcomes of MIDP compared with open distal pancreatectomy have been reported. In the Netherlands (2005 to 2013) only 10% of distal pancreatectomies were in a minimally invasive fashion and 85% of surgeons welcomed MIDP training. The feasibility and impact of a nationwide training program is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From 2014 to 2015, 32 pancreatic surgeons from 17 centers participated in a nationwide training program in MIDP, including detailed technique description, video training, and proctoring on-site. Outcomes of MIDP before training (2005-2013) were compared with outcomes after training (2014-2015).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 201 patients were included; 71 underwent MIDP in 9 years before training versus 130 in 22 months after training (7-fold increase, P < 0.001). The conversion rate (38% [n = 27] vs 8% [n = 11], P < 0.001) and blood loss were lower after training and more pancreatic adenocarcinomas were resected (7 [10%] vs 28 [22%], P = 0.03), with comparable R0-resection rates (4/7 [57%] vs 19/28 [68%], P = 0.67). Clavien-Dindo score ≥III complications (15 [21%] vs 19 [15%], P = 0.24) and pancreatic fistulas (20 [28%] vs 41 [32%], P = 0.62) were not significantly different. Length of hospital stay was shorter after training (9 [7-12] vs 7 [5-8] days, P < 0.001). Thirty-day mortality was 3% vs 0% (P = 0.12).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A nationwide MIDP training program was feasible and followed by a steep increase in the use of MIDP, also in patients with pancreatic cancer, and decreased conversion rates. Future studies should determine whether such a training program is applicable in other settings.",3
856,"Robotics in Cleft Surgery: Origins, Current Status and Future Directions","The field of robotic surgery is an exciting and growing field that has bolstered its way to become a mainstream application in a number of surgical disciplines. The application of robotic surgery in cleft surgery is novel and has captivated many with the benefit it provides: the slender and small arms with wrist articulation at the instrument tip; motion scaling; tremor elimination; and high fidelity, three-dimensional visualization make the robot a very attractive platform for use in confined spaces with small surgical targets. The story of the origin of robotic surgery in cleft surgery is an interesting one, and one that has arisen from other allied surgical specialities to render robotic cleft surgery as its own specialised field. A field that has coined its own terms and has demonstrated a number of applications for its use.

857,Transparent Interaction Based Learning for Human-Robot Collaboration,"The number of collaborative robots that perform different tasks in close proximity to humans is increasing. Previous studies showed that enabling non-expert users to program a cobot reduces the cost of robot maintenance and reprogramming. Since this approach is based on an interaction between the cobot and human partners, in this study, we investigate whether making this interaction more transparent can improve the interaction and lead to better performance for non-expert users. To evaluate the proposed methodology, an experiment with 67 participants is conducted. The obtained results show that providing explanation leads to higher performance, in terms of efficiency and efficacy, i.e., the number of times the task is completed without teaching a wrong instruction to the cobot is two times higher when explanations are provided. In addition, providing explanation also increases users' satisfaction and trust in working with the cobot.",4
858,The Application of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging During Robotic Liver Resection: A Case-Matched Study,"Background:
        
      
      The ICG fluorescence properties are progressively gaining momentum in the HPB surgery. However, the exact impact of ICG application on surgical outcomes is yet to be established.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty-five patients who underwent ICG fluorescence-guided robotic liver resection were case-matched in a 1:1 ratio to a cohort who underwent standard robotic liver resection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the ICG group, six additional lesions not diagnosed by preoperative workup and intraoperative ultrasound were identified and resected. Four of the lesions were proved to be malignant. Despite the similar operative time (288 vs. 272 min, p = 0.778), the risk of postoperative bile leakage (0% vs. 12%, p = 0.023), R1 resection (0% vs. 16%, p = 0.019) and readmission (p = 0.023) was reduced in the ICG group compared with the no-ICG group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The ICG fluorescence is a real-time navigation tool which enables surgeons to enhance visualization of anatomical structures and overcome the disadvantages of minimally invasive liver resection. The procedure is not time-consuming, and its applications can reduce the postoperative complication rate in robotic liver surgery.",1

          Method:
        
      
      Each step of the technique is illustrated using a composite collection of four operative patient videos to demonstrate the advantages and feasibility of this technique. The robot platform utilised is Da Vinci Xi.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five female patients have undergone this operation in our unit. The size of tumours ranged from 12 to 45 mm. Median operating time was 100 min (range 90-150). Mean blood loss in all the patients was less than 50 ml. There were no major intraoperative complications. One patient had a postoperative presacral collection which required radiological drainage. Length of stay in all patients was one day.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This technique using a single-docking robotic approach appears safe and feasible. The robotic approach results in improved dexterity and more accurate dissection, better retraction and excellent vision which improves the ease of operating in the pelvis. Therefore, this approach can be replicated for use in a wide variety of patients with tailgut cysts.",1
860,The determinants of home healthcare robots adoption: an empirical investigation,"Background:
        
      
      Home healthcare robots promise to make clinical information available at the right place and time, thereby reducing error and increasing safety and quality. However, it has been frequently reported that more than 40% of previous information technology (IT) developments have failed or been abandoned due to the lack of understanding of the sociotechnical aspects of IT.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      Previous home healthcare robots research has focused on technology development and clinical applications. There has been little discussion of associated social, technical and managerial issues that are arguably of equal importance for robot success. To fill this knowledge gap, this research aims to understand the determinants of home healthcare robots adoption from these aspects by applying technology acceptance theories.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies located in the U.S. (n=108), which included both patients and healthcare professionals. We collected data via a survey study to test a research model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The usage intention of home healthcare robots is a function of social influence, performance expectancy, trust, privacy concerns, ethical concerns and facilitating conditions. Among them, social influence is the strongest predictor. Monitoring vital signs and facilitating communication with family and medication reminders are the most preferable tasks and applications for robots.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Sociotechnical factors play a powerful role in explaining the adoption intention for home healthcare robots. The findings provide insights on how home healthcare service providers and robot designers may improve the success of robot technologies.",4
861,Comparison of robotic vs laparoscopic vs open distal pancreatectomy. A systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Introduction:
        
      
      The current evidence comparing oncological adequacy and effectiveness of robotic and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy to open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is inconclusive. Recent pairwise meta-analyses demonstrated reduced blood loss and length of stay as the principal advantages of RDP and LDP compared to ODP. The aim of this study was to compare the three approaches to distal pancreatectomy conducting a pairwise meta-analysis and consequently network meta-analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was performed using the databases, EMBASE, Pubmed, the Cochrane library, and Google Scholar. Meta-analyses were performed using both fixed-effect and random-effect models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      RDP cohort represented only 11% of the total sample; significantly younger patients with smaller size tumours were included in the RDP and LDP cohorts compared to ODP cohort. Significantly less blood loss and shorter length of stay were the advantages of both RDP and LDP compared to ODP. The ODP cohort included significantly more specimens with positive resection margins compared to RDP and LDP cohorts.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      The results of the present study demonstrate that reduced blood losses and shorter length of stay are the advantages of RDP and LDP compared to ODP. However, demographic discrepancies, underpowered RDP sample and differences in oncological burden do not permit certain conclusions regarding the oncological safety of RDP and LDP for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",1
862,"The robotic-assisted extended ""Sistrunk"" approach for tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract with limited transoral access: First description of oncological and functional outcomes","We report on the first clinical experience with the robotic-assisted extended ""Sistrunk"" approach (RESA) for access to constrained spaces of the upper aerodigestive tract. This prospective case cohort study include six patients that underwent RESA if transoral exposure could not be achieved. Three patients received previous radiation. Patients were postoperatively followed until week 16 for perioperative complications, surgical margins, and functional outcomes. In all patients RESA allowed adequate exposure and resection with negative margins. Three patients who underwent salvage surgery experienced a minor or intermediate grade postoperative bleeding. No patient developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. Three patients recovered their swallowing to their preoperative status and the remaining three experienced an improvement. All patients experienced complete recovery of their voice. RESA has the potential to provide a new organ preservation approach for head and neck cancer (HNC) not amenable to transoral exposure and thus warrants further prospective clinical studies.",1
863,A CT Image-Based Virtual Sensing Method to Estimate Bone Drilling Force for Surgical Robots,"Objective:
        
      
      Current surgical robots face challenges to understand preoperative images like human surgeons, which hindering robots from making full use of preoperative information to operate stably and efficiently. We offer a method to estimate drilling force information based on preoperative images to provide a priori force information for surgical robots performing bone drilling tasks.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A visual sensing computing framework is proposed to help robots calculate drill-tissue contact area 3D image information in a one-dimensional signal format. Under this computing framework, a computed tomography (CT) image-weighted bone drilling mechanical model is built, which further considers both targets bone shape and material properties to predict the thrust force, torque, and radial force of a drilling process based on preoperative CT images.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The built model can respond to multiple bone drilling process factors, such as personalized surgery plans, varying tissue densities, uneven drilling surfaces, different drilling speeds, feed rates, and drill bit geometries. The best trust force prediction error on bovine bones is 1.13 ± 0.95 N, and the best normalized average prediction error on porcine bones is 0.07 ± 0.08. Experiments in spinal pedicle screw placement surgery also show potential application abilities.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our method predicts the bone drilling force well based on preoperative images, providing robots with more efficient preoperative information.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      This work offers a new perspective to study the interaction relationship between robot surgical instruments and tissues with the assistance of preoperative images.",4
864,Robotic Handle Prototypes for Endoscopic Endonasal Skull Base Surgery: Pre-clinical Randomised Controlled Trial of Performance and Ergonomics,"Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is a promising alternative to transcranial approaches. However, standard instruments lack articulation, and thus, could benefit from robotic technologies. The aim of this study was to develop an ergonomic handle for a handheld robotic instrument intended to enhance this procedure. Two different prototypes were developed based on ergonomic guidelines within the literature. The first is a forearm-mounted handle that maps the surgeon's wrist degrees-of-freedom to that of the robotic end-effector; the second is a joystick-and-trigger handle with a rotating body that places the joystick to the position most comfortable for the surgeon. These handles were incorporated into a custom-designed surgical virtual simulator and were assessed for their performance and ergonomics when compared with a standard neurosurgical grasper. The virtual task was performed by nine novices with all three devices as part of a randomised crossover user-study. Their performance and ergonomics were evaluated both subjectively by themselves and objectively by a validated observational checklist. Both handles outperformed the standard instrument with the rotating joystick-body handle offering the most substantial improvement in terms of balance between performance and ergonomics. Thus, it is deemed the more suitable device to drive instrumentation for endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery.",1
865,Development and validation of a tool for non-technical skills evaluation in robotic surgery-the ICARS system,"Background:
        
      
      Non-technical skills (NTS) are being increasingly recognised as vital for safe surgical practice. Numerous NTS rating systems have been developed to support effective training and assessment. Yet despite the additional challenges posed by robotic surgery, no NTS rating systems have been developed for this unique surgical environment. This study reports the development and validation of the first NTS behavioural rating system for robotic surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A comprehensive index of all relevant NTS behaviours in robotic surgery was developed through observation of robotic theatre and interviews with robotic surgeons. Using a Delphi methodology, a panel of 16 expert surgeons was consulted to identify behaviours important to NTS assessment. These behaviours were organised into an appropriate assessment template. Experts were consulted on the feasibility, applicability and educational impact of ICARS. An observational trial was used to validate ICARS. 73 novice, intermediate and expert robotic surgeons completed a urethrovesical anastomosis within a simulated operating room. NTS were tested using four scripted scenarios of increasing difficulty. Performances were video recorded. Robotic and NTS experts assessed the videos post hoc using ICARS and the standard behavioural rating system, NOn-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      28 key non-technical behaviours were identified by the expert panel. The finalised behavioural rating system was organised into four principle domains and seven categories. Expert opinion strongly supported its implementation. ICARS was found to be equivalent to NOTSS on Bland-Altman analysis and accurately differentiated between novice, intermediate and expert participants, p = 0.01. Moderate agreement was found between raters, Krippendorff's alpha = 0.4. The internal structure of ICARS was shown to be consistent and reliable (median Cronbach alpha = 0.92, range 0.85-0.94).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      ICARS is the first NTS behavioural rating system developed for robotic surgery. Initial validation has shown it to be an effective and reliable tool. Implementation of ICARS will supported structured training and assessment of NTS within the robotic surgical curriculum.",3
866,Robotic Autonomy for Magnetic Endoscope Biopsy,"Magnetically actuated endoscopes are currently transitioning in to clinical use for procedures such as colonoscopy, presenting numerous benefits over their conventional counterparts. Intelligent and easy-to-use control strategies are an essential part of their clinical effectiveness due to the un-intuitive nature of magnetic field interaction. However, work on developing intelligent control for these devices has mainly been focused on general purpose endoscope navigation. In this work, we investigate the use of autonomous robotic control for magnetic colonoscope intervention via biopsy, another major component of clinical viability. We have developed control strategies with varying levels of robotic autonomy, including semi-autonomous routines for identifying and performing targeted biopsy, as well as random quadrant biopsy. We present and compare the performance of these approaches to magnetic endoscope biopsy against the use of a standard flexible endoscope on bench-top using a colonoscopy training simulator and silicone colon model. The semi-autonomous routines for targeted and random quadrant biopsy were shown to reduce user workload with comparable times to using a standard flexible endoscope.",0
867,Surgical treatment of high-risk prostate cancer,"High-risk prostate cancer (HRPC) currently comprises 17-35% of newly diagnosed cases and has the highest rate of metastasis and cancer-related death, making its management a top priority for improving prostate cancer outcomes. The definition of HRPC is not consensual and several risk stratification criteria have been used, which hinders the interpretation of data and the comparison of different studies. All classifications include prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, biopsy Gleason score and clinical stage as criteria, but others have been added in an attempt to make stratification more accurate and clinically useful, to enable identification of the patients that can be cured by local treatment of the disease. HRPC was traditionally treated with radiotherapy (RT) and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but radical prostatectomy (RP) has slowly gained more importance in this context. This article aims to discuss the role of surgery in HRPC, highlighting the advantages of RP as primary treatment option: the ability to provide a definitive stage and grade of the cancer; allowing an early detection of treatment failure by having an undetectable PSA as treatment target; providing excellent local control of the disease; reducing the risk of metastatic progression to a greater extent than does RT. We will try to show the benefits and risks of a ""surgery first"" approach, keeping in mind that, despite the curative intent, a significant number of patients will still need adjuvant or salvage RT and/or ADT.",0
868,The effect of service robot occupational gender stereotypes on customers' willingness to use them,"Customers have obvious occupational gender stereotypes for service employees. In recent years, intelligent service robots have been widely used in the hospitality industry and have also been given gender characteristics to attract customers to use them. However, whether and when the usage of gendered service robots is effective remains to be explored. This research focuses on customers' occupational gender stereotypes and the gender of service robots, examining the influences of their consistency on customers' willingness to use service robots through three scenario studies. The findings suggest that: (1) The consistency between occupational gender stereotypes and service robot gender positively affects customers' willingness to use service robots. (2) Performance expectancy and trust are two psychological mechanisms underlying the above effect. (3) In the context of service failures, the consistency backfires and brings negative effects on willingness to use. This research extends the literature on customers' acceptance of anthropomorphized robots from the perspective of gender stereotypes and identifies the mechanisms behind the stereotype consistency effect. For practical implications, hotels should design and deploy gendered robots consistent with corresponding occupational gender stereotypes.",4
869,"A realist process evaluation of robot-assisted surgery: integration into routine practice and impacts on communication, collaboration and decision-making","Background:
        
      
      The implementation of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) can be challenging, with reports of surgical robots being underused. This raises questions about differences compared with open and laparoscopic surgery and how best to integrate RAS into practice.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To (1) contribute to reporting of the ROLARR (RObotic versus LAparoscopic Resection for Rectal cancer) trial, by investigating how variations in the implementation of RAS and the context impact outcomes; (2) produce guidance on factors likely to facilitate successful implementation; (3) produce guidance on how to ensure effective teamwork; and (4) provide data to inform the development of tools for RAS.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Realist process evaluation alongside ROLARR. Phase 1 – a literature review identified theories concerning how RAS becomes embedded into practice and impacts on teamwork and decision-making. These were refined through interviews across nine NHS trusts with theatre teams. Phase 2 – a multisite case study was conducted across four trusts to test the theories. Data were collected using observation, video recording, interviews and questionnaires. Phase 3 – interviews were conducted in other surgical disciplines to assess the generalisability of the findings.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      The introduction of RAS is surgeon led but dependent on support at multiple levels. There is significant variation in the training provided to theatre teams. Contextual factors supporting the integration of RAS include the provision of whole-team training, the presence of handpicked dedicated teams and the availability of suitably sized operating theatres. RAS introduces challenges for teamwork that can impact operation duration, but, over time, teams develop strategies to overcome these challenges. Working with an experienced assistant supports teamwork, but experience of the procedure is insufficient for competence in RAS and experienced scrub practitioners are important in supporting inexperienced assistants. RAS can result in reduced distraction and increased concentration for the surgeon when he or she is supported by an experienced assistant or scrub practitioner.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our research suggests a need to pay greater attention to the training and skill mix of the team. To support effective teamwork, our research suggests that it is beneficial for surgeons to (1) encourage the team to communicate actions and concerns; (2) alert the attention of the assistant before issuing a request; and (3) acknowledge the scrub practitioner’s role in supporting inexperienced assistants. It is beneficial for the team to provide oral responses to the surgeon’s requests.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      This study started after the trial, limiting impact on analysis of the trial. The small number of operations observed may mean that less frequent impacts of RAS were missed.
    


          Future work:
        
      
      Future research should include (1) exploring the transferability of guidance for effective teamwork to other surgical domains in which technology leads to the physical or perceptual separation of surgeon and team; (2) exploring the benefits and challenges of including realist methods in feasibility and pilot studies; (3) assessing the feasibility of using routine data to understand the impact of RAS on rare end points associated with patient safety; (4) developing and evaluating methods for whole-team training; and (5) evaluating the impact of different physical configurations of the robotic console and team members on teamwork.

870,Towards Standardized Acquisition with a Dual-probe Ultrasound Robot for Fetal Imaging,"Standardized acquisitions and diagnoses using robots and AI would potentially increase the general usability and reliability of medical ultrasound. Working towards this prospect, this paper presents the recent developments of a standardized acquisition workflow using a novel dual-probe ultrasound robot, for a project known as intelligent Fetal Imaging and Diagnosis (iFIND). The workflow includes an abdominal surface mapping step to obtain a non-parametric spline surface, a rule-based end-point calculation method to position each individual joint, and a motor synchronization method to achieve a smooth motion towards a target point. The design and implementation of the robot are first presented in this paper and the proposed workflow is then explained in detail with simulation and volunteer experiments performed and analyzed. The closed-form analytical solution to the specific motion planning problem has demonstrated a reliable performance controlling the robot to move towards the expected scanning areas and the calculated proximity of the robot to the surface shows that the robot maintains a safe distance while moving around the abdomen. The volunteer study has successfully demonstrated the reliable working and controllability of the robot in terms of acquiring desired ultrasound views. Our future work will focus on improving the motion planning, and on integrating the proposed standardized acquisition workflow with newly- developed ultrasound image processing methods to obtain diagnostic results in an accurate and consistent way.",0
871,Robot-assisted kidney transplantation: an update,"Renal transplantation has become the gold-standard treatment for the majority of patients with established renal failure. Recent decades have seen significant progress in immunosuppressive therapies and advances in post-transplant management of recipients, resulting in improved graft and patient outcomes. However, the open technique of allograft implantation has stood the test of time, remaining largely unchanged. In a world where major advances in surgery have been facilitated by innovations in the fields of biotechnology and medical instrumentation, minimally invasive options have been introduced for the recipient undergoing kidney transplantation. In this review we present the evolution of minimally invasive kidney transplantation, with a specific focus on robot-assisted kidney transplant and the benefits it offers to specific patient groups. We also discuss the ethical concerns that must be addressed by transplant teams considering developing or referring to robotic programs.",0
872,Formalizing Human-Robot Mutual Adaptation: A Bounded Memory Model,"Mutual adaptation is critical for effective team collaboration. This paper presents a formalism for human-robot mutual adaptation in collaborative tasks. We propose the bounded-memory adaptation model (BAM), which captures human adaptive behaviors based on a bounded memory assumption. We integrate BAM into a partially observable stochastic model, which enables robot adaptation to the human. When the human is adaptive, the robot will guide the human towards a new, optimal collaborative strategy unknown to the human in advance. When the human is not willing to change their strategy, the robot adapts to the human in order to retain human trust. Human subject experiments indicate that the proposed formalism can significantly improve the effectiveness of human-robot teams, while human subject ratings on the robot performance and trust are comparable to those achieved by cross training, a state-of-the-art human-robot team training practice.",4
873,The Extraperitoneal Approach to Left-Sided Colorectal Resections: A Human Cadaveric Study,"Introduction:
        
      
      Technical challenges during laparoscopic and robotic anterior resection include identification of key retroperitoneal structures and obtaining clear views of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) pedicle and total mesorectal excision (TME) plane. Steep head-down position improves surgical exposure but is associated with cerebral oedema, high intrapulmonary pressures, and rare neurological complications. In this article we describe the key steps of an anterior resection performed via the extra-peritoneal (XP) space in the supine position.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The technique of same-side lateral-to-medial XP dissection has been developed and refined in serial cadaveric workshops. A standard periumbilical port is inserted for initial laparoscopic exploration. Dissection is then performed in the left XP space via a 5 cm skin incision (later used as the extraction site) to allow for insertion of four (latterly three) working ports. The colon is mobilized along its lateral attachments, reflecting retroperitoneal structures down and away. The IMA pedicle is taken proximally, next to the duodenum. If required, TME dissection can be continued in the same plane. A short intraperitoneal phase is then required to complete the procedure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight cadavers were studied (seven males; median 78 y). Four operations were performed laparoscopically and four robotically. Excellent views of the key retroperitoneal structures were achieved early in the procedure. Anatomical identification was performed sequentially for left-sided structures-psoas tendon, gonadal vessel, ureter, common iliac artery, IMA, and duodenum before ligation of the IMA pedicle. High ligation of IMA on the aorta and splenic flexure mobilization were performed in all eight procedures.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This novel study shows it is feasible to perform the key steps of an anterior resection using the XP space in the supine position. This will reduce the need for steep head-down positioning which may have meaningful clinical benefits. Prospective clinical studies are required to validate the technique within a patient population.",1
874,Gripe-Needle: A Sticky Suction Cup Gripper Equipped Needle for Targeted Therapeutics Delivery,"This paper presents a multi-purpose gripping and incision tool-set to reduce the number of required manipulators for targeted therapeutics delivery in Minimally Invasive Surgery. We have recently proposed the use of multi-arm Concentric Tube Robots (CTR) consisting of an incision, a camera, and a gripper manipulator for deep orbital interventions, with a focus on Optic Nerve Sheath Fenestration (ONSF). The proposed prototype in this research, called Gripe-Needle, is a needle equipped with a sticky suction cup gripper capable of performing both gripping of target tissue and incision tasks in the optic nerve area by exploiting the multi-tube arrangement of a CTR for actuation of the different tool-set units. As a result, there will be no need for an independent gripper arm for an incision task. The CTR innermost tube is equipped with a needle, providing the pathway for drug delivery, and the immediate outer tube is attached to the suction cup, providing the suction pathway. Based on experiments on various materials, we observed that adding a sticky surface with bio-inspired grooves to a normal suction cup gripper has many advantages such as, 1) enhanced adhesion through material stickiness and by air-tightening the contact surface, 2) maintained adhesion despite internal pressure variations, e.g. due to the needle motion, and 3) sliding resistance. Simple Finite Element and theoretical modeling frameworks are proposed, based on which a miniature tool-set is designed to achieve the required gripping forces during ONSF. The final designs were successfully tested for accessing the optic nerve of a realistic eye phantom in a skull eye orbit, robust gripping and incision on units of a plastic bubble wrap sample, and manipulating different tissue types of porcine eye samples.",0
875,A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Comparing the Accuracy and Clinical Outcome of Pedicle Screw Placement Using Robot-Assisted Technology and Conventional Freehand Technique,"Study design:
        
      
      Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed with the aim of exploring the differences in pedicle screw positioning accuracy, surgical time, length of hospital stay, postoperative back and leg Visual Analog Scale, revision surgeries, and intraoperative radiation time and exposure between robot-assisted technology and conventional freehand technique based on RCTs.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Several databases, including the Cochrane library, PubMed, and EMBASE were systematically searched to identify potentially eligible articles. Meta-analysis was done using STATA 13 software. The odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for the studied categories.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seven RCTs involving 290 patients (1298 pedicle screws) in the robot-assisted group and 288 patients (1348 pedicle screws) in the conventional freehand group were analyzed. The results revealed that grade (A) and grade (A+B) screw accuracies were significantly superior in the robot-assisted group (P = .008 and P = .009, respectively). Overall surgical duration and number of revision surgeries were significantly higher in the robot-assisted group (P = .014 and P < .0001, respectively). Intraoperative radiation time and dosage were significantly lower in the robot-assisted group (P < .0001 and P = .036, respectively).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      It was demonstrated that robot-assisted technology is superior to the conventional freehand technique in terms of grade (A) and grade (A+B) screw accuracies and in the reduction of intraoperative radiation time and dosage. On the other hand, the freehand technique showed superior results in terms of overall surgical duration and revision surgery rates.",1
876,"Robotics in total hip arthroplasty: a review of the evolution, application and evidence base","Robotic systems used in orthopaedics have evolved from active systems to semi-active systems.Early active systems were associated with significant technical and surgical complications, which limited their clinical use.The new semi-active system Mako has demonstrated promise in overcoming these limitations, with positive early outcomes.There remains a paucity of data regarding long-term outcomes associated with newer systems such as Mako and TSolution One, which will be important in assessing the applicability of these systems.Given the already high satisfaction rate of manual THA, further high-quality comparative studies are required utilizing outcome scores that are not limited by high ceiling effects to assess whether robotic systems justify their additional expense.

877,Implementation of robotic hernia surgery using the Versius® system,"This case series aims to demonstrate that hernia surgery is safe and feasible using the Versius® robotic system from CMR Surgical, and to describe the surgical techniques used. It is the first series published using this novel system. Forty-one consecutive hernia repair cases were completed using Versius®, including inguinal and ventral hernias. Data were collected prospectively on a number of pre-, peri-, and postoperative outcomes. Techniques are described for robotic transabdominal preperitoneal repair of inguinal hernia, and intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair of ventral hernia. Thirty-two inguinal and nine ventral hernia repairs were performed over a 12-month period. The population were 88% male with a mean body mass index of 27.4 ± 3.5. There were no conversions to open surgery. Median length of stay was 0 days. Six patients (15%) experienced urinary retention, and there were 2 further minor complications with no major complications, readmissions or reoperations. Use of the Versius® system for robotic hernia surgery is safe, with comparable results to existing robotic systems. Implementation is possible with minimal changes to established surgical techniques.",3
878,Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Gastric Resection for Primary Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors >5 cm: A Size-Matched and Location-Matched Comparison,"This study compared robotic (RR) and laparoscopic resection (LR) for primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach >5 cm. Twelve consecutive patients who underwent RR from 2012 to 2015 were matched for tumor size and location with 24 patients who underwent LR from 2000 to 2012. The median tumor size was 7.1 cm (range, 5.5 to 11.5). GISTs were resected by wedge resection (91.7%) or distal gastrectomy. The median RR operative time was longer than that of LR (162.5 vs. 130 min, respectively; P=0.004). Only 1 LR patient required conversion. The time to flatus and hospital stay were similar between groups. Overall, 3 patients developed minor postoperative complications that were medically treated. Mortality was nil. All resections were R0. No difference was observed in the incidence of recurrence. RR was significantly more expensive (+21.6%) than LR. RR appears to be safe and feasible for GISTs>5 cm, but is associated with longer operative times and greater costs.",9
879,Fluorescence-guided selective arterial clamping during RAPN provides better early functional outcomes based on renal scan compared to standard clamping,"To compare the functional and operative outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy with selective arterial clamping guided by near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF-RAPN) versus a cohort of patients who underwent standard RAPN without selective arterial clamping (S-RAPN). 62 consecutive patients underwent RAPN from January 2016 to May 2017: the last 20 patients underwent NIRF-RAPN. Preoperative and postoperative renal scan at 1 month were performed to evaluate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the operated renal unit and total function. Functional and operative outcomes of cases were compared with a cohort of 42 patients undergoing S-RAPN. Selective clamping was performed in 15 patients (75%), whereas five (25%) cases were converted to S-RAPN, due to incomplete ischemic appearance of the tumor after selective clamping. Median tumor diameter was 40 mm in both groups. Median selective clamping was 24 min in both groups. Operative time (206' vs 190') and blood loss (200 vs 170 cc) were comparable. No major complications have been reported in the NIRF-RAPN group, whereas three acute hemorrhages with embolization were found in the S-RAPN group. The analysis of renal scan data revealed that a greater loss of GFR in the operated renal unit was observed after S-RAPN compared to NIRF-RAPN [21.5% vs. 5.5%; p = 0.046], as well as total GFR loss [8% vs 0%; p = 0.007]. The use of NIRF imaging was associated with improved short-term renal functional outcomes compared to RAPN without selective arterial clamping. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study analyzing the GFR obtained from renal scan.",2
880,Baseline swallowing measures predict recovery at 6 weeks after transoral robotic surgery for head and neck cancer,"Objectives:
        
      
      To explore whether pre-treatment swallowing measures predict swallowing recovery at 6 weeks after transoral robotic surgery (TORS).
    


          Design:
        
      
      Prospective cohort study.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Tertiary care cancer centre in the United Kingdom.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Fifty-one consecutive patients undergoing TORS for head and neck cancer, between April 2013 and February 2015.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Swallowing function assessed by Performance Status Scale (PSS) Normalcy of Diet, timed water swallow test capacity scores (WST) and duration of tube feeding.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The primary site distribution was as follows: 21 oropharynx, 8 larynx, 6 mucosectomy and 6 hypopharynx. T stages included 7 staged Tx, 21 T1-T2 tumours and 1 T3 tumour. Moderate-to-severe comorbidity was found in 45/51 patients. Mean PSS score was 83 (sd 27.54); mean WST score was 11.14 (sd 7.97). Most patients (73%) required tube feeding post-operatively, with mean tube feed duration of 18.08 days (sd 17.91); 76% resumed oral intake by 6 weeks. Pre-treatment swallow tests showed moderate negative correlation with tube feeding duration: PSS (rho 0-.430, P = .003); WST (rho 0-.503, P = 0.002).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The majority of TORS patients resume oral intake by 6 weeks. This study shows that impaired swallowing prior to surgery correlates with post-operative duration of tube feeding and strengthens the evidence for the utility of these measures in this clinical setting.",1
881,Establishing objective benchmarks in robotic virtual reality simulation at the level of a competent surgeon using the RobotiX Mentor simulator,"Background:
        
      
      To establish objective benchmarks at the level of a competent robotic surgeon across different exercises and metrics for the RobotiX Mentor virtual reality (VR) simulator suitable for use within a robotic surgical training curriculum.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective observational study analysed results from multiple data sources, all of which used the RobotiX Mentor VR simulator. 123 participants with varying experience from novice to expert completed the exercises. Competency was established as the 25th centile of the mean advanced intermediate score. Three basic skill exercises and two advanced skill exercises were used.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      King's College London.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      84 Novice, 26 beginner intermediates, 9 advanced intermediates and 4 experts were used in this retrospective observational study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Objective benchmarks derived from the 25th centile of the mean scores of the advanced intermediates provided suitably challenging yet also achievable targets for training surgeons. The disparity in scores was greatest for the advanced exercises. Novice surgeons are able to achieve the benchmarks across all exercises in the majority of metrics.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      We have successfully created this proof-of-concept study, which requires validation in a larger cohort. Objective benchmarks obtained from the 25th centile of the mean scores of advanced intermediates provide clinically relevant benchmarks at the standard of a competent robotic surgeon that are challenging yet also attainable. That can be used within a VR training curriculum allowing participants to track and monitor their progress in a structured and progressional manner through five exercises. Providing clearly defined targets, ensuring that a universal training standard has been achieved across training surgeons.",0
882,An international multicenter propensity-score matched and coarsened-exact matched analysis comparing robotic versus laparoscopic partial liver resections of the anterolateral segments,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic liver resections (RLR) may have the ability to address some of the drawbacks of laparoscopic liver resections (LLR) but few studies have done a head-to-head comparison of the outcomes after anterolateral segment resections by the two techniques.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective study was conducted of 3202 patients who underwent minimally invasive LR of the anterolateral liver segments at 26 international centres from 2005 to 2020. Two thousand six hundred and six cases met study criteria of which there were 358 RLR and 1868 LLR cases. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the two groups using a 1:3 Propensity Score Matched (PSM) and 1:1 Coarsened Exact Matched (CEM) analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients matched after 1:3 PSM (261 RLR vs 783 LLR) and 1:1 CEM (296 RLR vs 296 LLR) revealed no significant differences in length of stay, readmission rates, morbidity, mortality, and involvement of or close oncological margins. RLR surgeries were associated with significantly less blood loss (50 mL vs 100 ml, P < .001) and lower rates of open conversion on both PSM (1.5% vs 6.8%, P = .003) and CEM (1.4% vs 6.4%, P = .004) compared to LLR. Though PSM analysis showed RLR to have a longer operating time than LLR (170 minutes vs 160 minutes, P = .036), this difference proved to be insignificant on CEM (167 minutes vs 163 minutes, P = .575).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This multicentre international combined PSM and CEM study showed that both RLR and LLR have equivalent perioperative outcomes when performed in selected patients at high-volume centres. The robotic approach was associated with significantly lower blood loss and allowed more surgeries to be completed in a minimally invasive fashion.",2
883,Robotic assistance and general anaesthesia improve catheter stability and increase signal attenuation during atrial fibrillation ablation,"Aims:
        
      
      Recurrent arrhythmias after ablation procedures are often caused by recovery of ablated tissue. Robotic catheter manipulation systems increase catheter tip stability which improves energy delivery and could produce more transmural lesions. We tested this assertion using bipolar voltage attenuation as a marker of lesion quality comparing robotic and manual circumferential pulmonary vein ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Twenty patients were randomly assigned to robotic or manual AF ablation at standard radiofrequency (RF) settings for our institution (30 W 60 s manual, 25 W 30 s robotic, R30). A separate group of 10 consecutive patients underwent robotic ablation at increased RF duration, 25 W for 60 s (R60). Lesions were marked on an electroanatomic map before and after ablation to measure distance moved and change in bipolar electrogram amplitude during RF. A total of 1108 lesions were studied (761 robotic, 347 manual). A correlation was identified between voltage attenuation and catheter movement during RF (Spearman's rho -0.929, P < 0.001). The ablation catheter was more stable during robotic RF; 2.9 ± 2.3 mm (R30) and 2.6 ± 2.2 mm (R60), both significantly less than the manual group (4.3 ± 3.0 mm, P < 0.001). Despite improved stability, there was no difference in signal attenuation between the manual and R30 group. However, there was increased signal attenuation in the R60 group (52.4 ± 19.4%) compared with manual (47.7 ± 25.4%, P = 0.01). When procedures under general anaesthesia (GA) and conscious sedation were analysed separately, the improvement in signal attenuation in the R60 group was only significant in the procedures under GA.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotically assisted ablation has the capability to deliver greater bipolar voltage attenuation compared with manual ablation with appropriate selection of RF parameters. General anaesthesia confers additional benefits of catheter stability and greater signal attenuation. These findings may have a significant impact on outcomes from AF ablation procedures.",0
884,"A randomized prospective mechanistic cardiac magnetic resonance study correlating catheter stability, late gadolinium enhancement and 3 year clinical outcomes in robotically assisted vs. standard catheter ablation","Aims:
        
      
      To prospectively compare cardiac magnetic resonance late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) findings created by standard vs. robotically assisted catheter ablation lesions and correlate these with clinical outcomes.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      Forty paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients (mean age 54 ± 13.8 years) undergoing first left atrial ablation were randomized to either robotic-assisted navigation (Hansen Sensei(®) X) or standard navigation. Pre-procedural, acute (24 h post-procedure) and late (beyond 3 months) scans were performed with LGE and T2W imaging sequences and percentage circumferential enhancement around the pulmonary vein (PV) antra were quantified. Baseline pre-procedural enhancements were similar in both groups. On acute imaging, mean % encirclements by LGE and T2W signal were 72% and 80% in the robotic group vs. 60% (P = 0.002) and 76%(P = 0.45) for standard ablation. On late imaging, the T2W signal resolved to baseline in both groups. Late gadolinium enhancement remained the predominant signal with 56% encirclement in the robotic group vs. 45% in the standard group (P = 0.04). At 6 months follow-up, arrhythmia-free patients had an almost similar mean LGE encirclement (robotic 64%, standard 60%, P = 0.45) but in recurrences, LGE was higher in the robotic group (43% vs. 30%, P = 0.001). At mean 3 years follow-up, 1.3 procedures were performed in the robotic group compared with 1.9 (P < 0.001) in the standard to achieve a success rate of 80% vs. 75%.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotically assisted ablation results in greater LGE around the PV antrum. Effective lesions created through improved catheter stability and contact force during initial treatment may have a role in reducing subsequent re-do procedures.",0
885,"Is It Personal? The Impact of Personally Relevant Robotic Failures (PeRFs) on Humans' Trust, Likeability, and Willingness to Use the Robot","In three laboratory experiments, we examine the impact of personally relevant failures (PeRFs) on users' perceptions of a collaborative robot. PeR is determined by how much a specific issue applies to a particular person, i.e., it affects one's own goals and values. We hypothesized that PeRFs would reduce trust in the robot and the robot's Likeability and Willingness to Use (LWtU) more than failures that are not personal to participants. To achieve PeR in human-robot interaction, we utilized three different manipulation mechanisms: (A) damage to property, (B) financial loss, and (C) first-person versus third-person failure scenarios. In total, 132 participants engaged with a robot in person during a collaborative task of laundry sorting. All three experiments took place in the same experimental environment, carefully designed to simulate a realistic laundry sorting scenario. Results indicate that the impact of PeRFs on perceptions of the robot varied across the studies. In experiments A and B, the encounters with PeRFs reduced trust significantly relative to a no failure session. But not entirely for LWtU. In experiment C, the PeR manipulation had no impact. The work highlights challenges and adjustments needed for studying robotic failures in laboratory settings. We show that PeR manipulations affect how users perceive a failing robot. The results bring about new questions regarding failure types and their perceived severity on users' perception of the robot. Putting PeR aside, we observed differences in the way users perceive interaction failures compared (experiment C) to how they perceive technical ones (A and B).",4
886,Transoral Robotic Surgery for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Improving Function While Maintaining Oncologic Outcome,"The improved survival in patients with HPV-positive (human papilloma virus) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma as compared with HPV-negative disease calls for treatment that preserves quality of life, particularly a functional swallow. There are several trials currently assessing treatment de-escalation in terms of less invasive transoral robotic surgery, reduced-dose radiotherapy, and omission of chemotherapy in this disease cohort. It is important for head and neck oncology surgeons to stay abreast of developments in this area to offer their patients the most up-to-date treatment and consider recruiting patients to trials at their institutions. For this purpose, we provide a summary of current trials and associated challenges in managing a disease with fast-evolving treatment algorithms.",1
887,Automation Inner Speech as an Anthropomorphic Feature Affecting Human Trust: Current Issues and Future Directions,"This paper aims to discuss the possible role of inner speech in influencing trust in human-automation interaction. Inner speech is an everyday covert inner monolog or dialog with oneself, which is essential for human psychological life and functioning as it is linked to self-regulation and self-awareness. Recently, in the field of machine consciousness, computational models using different forms of robot speech have been developed that make it possible to implement inner speech in robots. As is discussed, robot inner speech could be a new feature affecting human trust by increasing robot transparency and anthropomorphism.",4
888,Normal motor adaptation in cervical dystonia: a fundamental cerebellar computation is intact,"The potential role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of dystonia has become a focus of recent research. However, direct evidence for a cerebellar contribution in humans with dystonia is difficult to obtain. We examined motor adaptation, a test of cerebellar function, in 20 subjects with primary cervical dystonia and an equal number of aged matched controls. Adaptation to both visuomotor (distorting visual feedback by 30°) and forcefield (applying a velocity-dependent force) conditions were tested. Our hypothesis was that cerebellar abnormalities observed in dystonia research would translate into deficits of cerebellar adaptation. We also examined the relationship between adaptation and dystonic head tremor as many primary tremor models implicate the cerebellothalamocortical network which is specifically tested by this motor paradigm. Rates of adaptation (learning) in cervical dystonia were identical to healthy controls in both visuomotor and forcefield tasks. Furthermore, the ability to adapt was not clearly related to clinical features of dystonic head tremor. We have shown that a key motor control function of the cerebellum is intact in the most common form of primary dystonia. These results have important implications for current anatomical models of the pathophysiology of dystonia. It is important to attempt to progress from general statements that implicate the cerebellum to a more specific evidence-based model. The role of the cerebellum in this enigmatic disease perhaps remains to be proven.",6
889,Application of autofluorescence robotic histology for quantitative evaluation of the 3-dimensional morphology of murine articular cartilage,"Murine models of osteoarthritis (OA) are increasingly important for understating pathogenesis and for testing new therapeutic approaches. Their translational potential is, however, limited by the reduced size of mouse limbs which requires a much higher resolution to evaluate their articular cartilage compared to clinical imaging tools. In experimental models, this tissue has been predominantly assessed by time-consuming histopathology using standardized semi-quantitative scoring systems. This study aimed to develop a novel imaging method for 3-dimensional (3D) histology of mouse articular cartilage, using a robotic system-termed here ""3D histocutter""-which automatically sections tissue samples and serially acquires fluorescence microscopy images of each section. Tibiae dissected from C57Bl/6 mice, either naïve or OA-induced by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), were imaged using the 3D histocutter by exploiting tissue autofluorescence. Accuracy of 3D imaging was validated by ex vivo contrast-enhanced micro-CT and sensitivity to lesion detection compared with conventional histology. Reconstructions of tibiae obtained from 3D histocutter serial sections showed an excellent agreement with contrast-enhanced micro-CT reconstructions. Furthermore, osteoarthritic features, including articular cartilage loss and osteophytes, were also visualized. An in-house developed software allowed to automatically evaluate articular cartilage morphology, eliminating the subjectivity associated to semi-quantitative scoring and considerably increasing analysis throughput. The novelty of this methodology is, not only the increased throughput in imaging and evaluating mouse articular cartilage morphology starting from conventionally embedded samples, but also the ability to add the third dimension to conventional histomorphometry which might be useful to improve disease assessment in the model.",0
890,"A multinational, multi-institutional study comparing positive surgical margin rates among 22393 open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients","Background:
        
      
      Positive surgical margins (PSMs) are a known risk factor for biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and are potentially affected by surgical technique and volume.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To investigate whether radical prostatectomy (RP) modality and volume affect PSM rates.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Fourteen institutions in Europe, the United States, and Australia were invited to participate in this study, all of which retrospectively provided margins data on 9778 open RP, 4918 laparoscopic RP, and 7697 robotic RP patients operated on between January 2000 and October 2011.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:
        
      
      The outcome measure was PSM rate. Multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score methods identified odds ratios for risk of a PSM for one modality compared with another, after adjustment for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, postoperative Gleason score, pathologic stage, and year of surgery. Classic adjustment using standard covariates was also implemented to compare PSM rates based on center volume for each minimally invasive surgical cohort.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Open RP patients had higher-risk PCa at time of surgery on average and were operated on earlier in the study time period on average, compared with minimally invasive cohorts. Crude margin rates were lowest for robotic RP (13.8%), intermediate for laparoscopic RP (16.3%), and highest for open RP (22.8%); significant differences persisted, although were ameliorated, after statistical adjustments. Lower-volume centers had increased risks of PSM compared with the highest-volume center for both laparoscopic RP and robotic RP. The study is limited by its nonrandomized nature; missing data across covariates, especially year of surgery in many of the open cohort cases; lack of standardized histologic processing and central pathology review; and lack of information regarding potential confounders such as patient comorbidity, nerve-sparing status, lymph node status, tumor volume, and individual surgeon caseload.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This multinational, multi-institutional study of 22 393 patients after RP suggests that PSM rates might be lower after minimally invasive techniques than after open RP and that PSM rates are affected by center volume in laparoscopic and robotic cases.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this study, we compared the effectiveness of different types of surgery for prostate cancer by looking at the rates of cancer cells left at the margins of what was removed in the operations. We compared open, keyhole, and robotic surgery from many centers across the globe and found that robotic and keyhole operations appeared to have lower margin rates than open surgeries. How many cases a center and surgeon do seems to affect this rate for both robotic and keyhole procedures.",2
891,Robotic versus laparoscopic radical nephrectomy: a large multi-institutional analysis (ROSULA Collaborative Group),"Objective:
        
      
      To compare the outcomes of robotic radical nephrectomy (RRN) to those of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN) for large renal masses.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective analysis of RRN and LRN cases performed for large (≥ cT2) renal masses from 2004 to 2017 and collected in the multi-institutional international database (ROSULA: RObotic SUrgery for LArge renal masses). Peri-operative, functional, and oncologic outcomes were compared between each approach. Descriptive analyses were performed and presented as medians with interquartile ranges. Inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted multivariable analyses were used to identify predictors of peri-operative complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models were used to assess survival outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 941 patients (RRN = 404, LRN = 537) were identified. There was no difference in terms of gender, age, and clinical tumor size. Over the study period, RRN had an annual increase of 11.75% (95% CI [7.34, 17.01] p < 0.001) and LRN had an annual decline of 5.39% (95% CI [-6.94, -3.86] p < 0.001). Patients undergoing RRN had higher BMI (27.6 [IQR 24.8-31.1] vs. 26.5 [24.1-30.0] kg/m2, p < 0.01). Operative duration was longer for RRN (185.0 [150.0-237.2] vs. 126 [90.8-180.0] min, p < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter for RRN (3.0 [2.0-4.0] vs. 5.0 [4.0-7.0] days, p < 0.001). RRN cases presented more advanced disease (higher pathologic staging [pT3-4 52.5 vs. 24.2%, p < 0.001], histologic grade [high grade 49.3 vs. 30.4%, p < 0.001], and rate of nodal disease [pN1 5.4 vs. 1.9%, p < 0.01]). Surgical approach did not represent an independent risk factor for peri-operative complications (OR 1.81 95% CI [0.97-3.39], adjusted p = 0.2). The main study limitation is the retrospective design.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study represents the largest known multi-center comparison between RRN and LRN. The two procedures seem to offer similar peri-operative outcomes. Notably, RRN has been increasingly utilized, especially in the setting of more advanced and surgically challenging disease without increasing the risk of peri-operative complications.",5
892,Quality assurance of Cyberknife robotic stereotactic radiosurgery using an angularly independent silicon detector,"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of an angularly independent silicon detector (edgeless diodes) developed for dosimetry in megavoltage radiotherapy for Cyberknife in a phantom and for patient quality assurance (QA).
    


          Method:
        
      
      The characterization of the edgeless diodes has been performed on Cyberknife with fixed and IRIS collimators. The edgeless diode probes were tested in terms of basic QA parameters such as measurements of tissue-phantom ratio (TPR), output factor and off-axis ratio. The measurements were performed in both water and water-equivalent phantoms. In addition, three patient-specific plans have been delivered to a lung phantom with and without motion and dose measurements have been performed to verify the ability of the diodes to work as patient-specific QA devices. The data obtained by the edgeless diodes have been compared to PTW 60016, SN edge, PinPoint ionization chamber, Gafchromic EBT3 film, and treatment planning system (TPS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      The TPR measurement performed by the edgeless diodes show agreement within 2.2% with data obtained with PTW 60016 diode for all the field sizes. Output factor agrees within 2.6% with that measured by SN EDGE diodes corrected for their field size dependence. The beam profiles' measurements of edgeless diodes match SN EDGE diodes with a measured full width half maximum (FWHM) within 2.3% and penumbra widths within 0.148 mm. Patient-specific QA measurements demonstrate an agreement within 4.72% in comparison with TPS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The edgeless diodes have been proved to be an excellent candidate for machine and patient QA for Cyberknife reproducing commercial dosimetry device measurements without need of angular dependence corrections. However, further investigation is required to evaluate the effect of their dose rate dependence on complex brain cancer dose verification.",0
893,Towards Autonomous Robotic Minimally Invasive Ultrasound Scanning and Vessel Reconstruction on Non-Planar Surfaces,"Autonomous robotic Ultrasound (US) scanning has been the subject of research for more than 2 decades. However, little work has been done to apply this concept into a minimally invasive setting, in which accurate force sensing is generally not available and robot kinematics are unreliable due to the tendon-driven, compliant robot structure. As a result, the adequate orientation of the probe towards the tissue surface remains unknown and the anatomy reconstructed from scan may become highly inaccurate. In this work we present solutions to both of these challenges: an attitude sensor fusion scheme for improved kinematic sensing and a visual, deep learning based algorithm to establish and maintain contact between the organ surface and the US probe. We further introduce a novel scheme to estimate and orient the probe perpendicular to the center line of a vascular structure. Our approach enables, for the first time, to autonomously scan across a non-planar surface and navigate along an anatomical structure with a robotically guided minimally invasive US probe. Our experiments on a vessel phantom with a convex surface confirm a significant improvement of the reconstructed curved vessel geometry, with our approach strongly reducing the mean positional error and variance. In the future, our approach could help identify vascular structures more effectively and help pave the way towards semi-autonomous assistance during partial hepatectomy and the potential to reduce procedure length and complication rates.",0
894,Robotic Techniques in Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: An Assessment of Short- and Long-Term Clinical Outcomes,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic esophagogastric cancer surgery is gaining widespread adoption. This population-based cohort study aimed to compare rates of textbook outcomes (TOs) and survival from robotic minimally invasive techniques for esophagogastric cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the United States National Cancer Database (NCDB) (2010-2017) were used to identify patients with non-metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer receiving open surgery (to the esophagus, n = 11,442; stomach, n = 22,183), laparoscopic surgery (to the esophagus [LAMIE], n = 4827; stomach [LAMIG], n = 6359), or robotic surgery (to the esophagus [RAMIE], n = 1657; stomach [RAMIG], n = 1718). The study defined TOs as 15 or more lymph nodes examined, margin-negative resections, hospital stay less than 21 days, no 30-day readmissions, and no 90-day mortalities. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox analyses were used to account for treatment selection bias.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients receiving robotic surgery were more commonly treated in high-volume academic centers with advanced clinical T and N stage disease. From 2010 to 2017, TO rates increased for esophageal and gastric cancer treated via all surgical techniques. Compared with open surgery, significantly higher TO rates were associated with RAMIE (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.58) and RAMIG (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.17-1.45). For esophagectomy, long-term survival was associated with both TO (hazard ratio [HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.60-0.67) and RAMIE (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84-1.00). For gastrectomy, long-term survival was associated with TO (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.56-0.60) and both LAMIG (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.94) and RAMIG (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.96). Subset analysis in high-volume centers confirmed similar findings.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite potentially adverse learning curve effects and more advanced tumor stages captured during the study period, both RAMIE and RAMIG performed in mostly high-volume centers were associated with improved TO and long-term survival. Therefore, consideration for wider adoption but a well-designed phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) is required for a full evaluation of the benefits conferred by robotic techniques for esophageal and gastric cancers.",9
895,Robotic partial nephrectomy vs minimally invasive radical nephrectomy for clinical T2a renal mass: a propensity score-matched comparison from the ROSULA (Robotic Surgery for Large Renal Mass) Collaborative Group,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare outcomes of minimally invasive radical nephrectomy (MIS-RN) and robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in clinical T2a renal mass (cT2aRM).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Retrospective, multicentre, propensity score-matched (PSM) comparison of RAPN and MIS-RN for cT2aRM (T2aN0M0). Cohorts were PSM for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, clinical tumour size, and R.E.N.A.L. score using a 2:1 ratio for RN:PN. The primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), complication rates, and de novo estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Multivariable (MVA) and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses (KMSA) were conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all, 648 patients (216 RAPN/432 MIS-RN) were matched. There were no significant differences in intraoperative complications (P = 0.478), Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥III complications (P = 0.063), and re-admissions (P = 0.238). The MVA revealed high ASA class (hazard ratio [HR] 2.7, P = 0.044) and sarcomatoid (HR 5.3, P = 0.001), but not surgery type (P = 0.601) to be associated with all-cause mortality. Increasing R.E.N.A.L. score (HR 1.31, P = 0.037), high tumour grade (HR 2.5, P = 0.043), and sarcomatoid (HR 2.8, P = 0.02) were associated with recurrence, but not surgery (P = 0.555). Increasing age (HR 1.1, P < 0.001) and RN (HR 3.9, P < 0.001) were predictors of de novo eGFR of <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Comparing RAPN and MIS-RN, KMSA revealed no significant differences for 5-year OS (76.3% vs 88.0%, P = 0.221) and 5-year DFS (78.6% vs 85.3%, P = 0.630) for pT2 RCC, and no differences for 3-year OS (P = 0.351) and 3-year DFS (P = 0.117) for pT3a upstaged RCC. The 5-year freedom from de novo eGFR of <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 was 91.6% for RAPN vs 68.9% for MIS-RN (P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RAPN had similar oncological outcomes and morbidity profile as MIS-RN, while conferring functional benefit. RAPN may be considered as a first-line option for cT2aRM.",2
896,Trans-peritoneal vs. retroperitoneal robotic assisted partial nephrectomy in posterior renal tumours: need for a risk-stratified patient individualised approach. A systematic review and meta-analysis,"To systematically review world literature and compare peri-operative outcome including operating time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), warm ischemia time (WIT), length of stay (LOS) and complications between retroperitoneal robotic assisted partial nephrectomy (RP-RAPN) and trans-peritoneal robotic assisted partial nephrectomy (TP-RAPN) for posteriorly located renal masses. All randomised trials and observational studies comparing RP-RAPN and TP-RAPN for posteriorly located renal masses were considered. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, GRADE) was used to rate the quality of evidence. 82 potential publications were identified. 3 were included in the review. All three studies were observational comparative studies. 347 and 550 patients underwent RP-RAPN and TP-RAPN, respectively, for posteriorly located tumours. There was statistically significant difference in LOS between the 2 techniques, favouring the RP-RAPN cohort: risk ratio (M-H, random, 95% CI), - 0.42 [- 0.67, - 0.18], p < 0.0006. There was no statistically significant difference in overall complication rates between the two techniques: risk ratio (M-H, fixed, 95% CI), 0.80 [0.49, 1.30], p = 0.37. There was no statistically significant difference in ≥ Clavien 3a complication rates between the two t echniques: risk ratio (M-H, fixed, 95% CI), 1.17 [0.62, 2.19], p = 0.63. OT, EBL, WIT and positive margin rates were similar for both approaches. The quality of evidence for complications, LOS and remaining outcomes were 'moderate', 'low' and 'very low', respectively, on GRADE approach. The current review suggests that the LOS with RP-RAPN are significantly lesser than TP-RAPN for posterior tumours. The RP-RAPN does not appear to offer any advantage over TP-RAPN for other peri-operative outcomes such as WIT, OT and EBL. The surgical margin rates and morbidity between the two approaches appear to be similar.",8
897,Superior Mesenteric Artery Injury During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Nephrectomy: A Robotic Nightmare,"Major vascular injuries during robotic renal surgery are rare, but the close proximity of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) to the left renal artery means that it is liable to iatrogenic injury with potentially catastrophic implications. In this review, we present a case of accidental SMA ligation during a robot-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy for a 12-cm upper pole renal mass. Prompt recognition and early vascular surgical assistance with conversion to open surgery allowed a primary vascular anastomosis to be made. A computed tomography angiogram at 6 wk was normal. On review of the imaging, the left renal artery take-off was higher than the SMA, which represents an anatomical variant and may have contributed to the injury. The risk of accidental SMA ligation is highest in left-sided tumours and in larger medial tumours that lead to significant distortion of the anatomy. The anatomy of the renal artery can also vary greatly. Surgeons must be knowledgeable of common variations and meticulously review preoperative imaging for the number and course of renal vessels as well as the location of the SMA. In cases of significant bleeding, rapid conversion to open surgery and urgent vascular consultation are critical.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this article, we describe an accidental injury to a major blood vessel (the superior mesenteric artery) during a left robotic radical nephrectomy (kidney removal) for a tumour. We discuss the anatomical relationships of the blood vessels of the small bowel and kidneys, and how to anticipate, recognise, and manage such accidental injuries.",1
898,Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion - The new 'gold standard'? Evidence from a systematic review,"Objective:
        
      
      To investigate whether a totally intracorporeally radical cystectomy (RC) can be considered the new 'gold standard' in bladder cancer, as open RC (ORC) is the current 'gold standard' for surgical treatment of muscle-invasive and high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is becoming the preferred surgical approach in many centres as it seems to maintain the oncological control of open surgery whilst offering improved perioperative benefits.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A review of the literature was conducted using the Pubmed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Databases to identify studies that included both ORC and RARC with intracorporeal and extracorporeal urinary diversion (UD) published up to July 2017.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Evidence from four single-centre randomised controlled trials and now the multicentre Randomized Trial of Open versus Robotic Cystectomy (RAZOR) trial demonstrate the oncological equivalence of RARC to ORC. The only convincing evidence for the superiority of RARC is in the area of blood loss and transfusion rates. However, the UD procedure in these trials was performed extracorporeally and, to realise the full benefits of RARC, a totally intracorporeal approach is needed. Intracorporeal UDs (ICUDs) have been shown to be technically feasible by a few expert centres and have demonstrated some improved short-term perioperative outcomes compared to extracorporeal UDs.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although initial outcomes appear promising, RARC with ICUD is far from gaining 'gold standard' status. Further studies are needed to confirm that outcomes are reproducible widely. Furthermore, the benefits of a totally intracorporeal approach must be confirmed in randomised controlled trials.",2

900,"Single-session, dual-site robotic surgery for synchronous primary malignancies of the oropharynx and thorax","Single-session, dual-site robotic surgery for synchronous malignancies is not widely reported. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) in a single sitting. A 49-year-old male presented with a neck lump. Biopsies and imaging proved synchronous primaries of the tonsil and lung. The morbidity of primary dual-site chemoradiotherapy, or open surgery, presented a management challenge. We therefore opted for sequential robotic resections, in a single sitting. The patient was discharged on Day 6 post-operatively and was able to start radiotherapy less than 3 weeks post-operatively. Undertaking TORS and RATS in a single sitting is feasible and safe. This approach allowed fast-tracking of adjuvant oncological therapy, arguably conveying the greatest chance of cure. We detail the rationale and utility of this novel approach and describe the surgical and anaesthetic challenges of two teams undertaking sequential robotic procedures in a single sitting.",0
901,The influence of interdependence and a transparent or explainable communication style on human-robot teamwork,"Humans and robots are increasingly working together in human-robot teams. Teamwork requires communication, especially when interdependence between team members is high. In previous work, we identified a conceptual difference between sharing what you are doing (i.e., being transparent) and why you are doing it (i.e., being explainable). Although the second might sound better, it is important to avoid information overload. Therefore, an online experiment (n = 72) was conducted to study the effect of communication style of a robot (silent, transparent, explainable, or adaptive based on time pressure and relevancy) on human-robot teamwork. We examined the effects of these communication styles on trust in the robot, workload during the task, situation awareness, reliance on the robot, human contribution during the task, human communication frequency, and team performance. Moreover, we included two levels of interdependence between human and robot (high vs. low), since mutual dependency might influence which communication style is best. Participants collaborated with a virtual robot during two simulated search and rescue tasks varying in their level of interdependence. Results confirm that in general robot communication results in more trust in and understanding of the robot, while showing no evidence of a higher workload when the robot communicates or adds explanations to being transparent. Providing explanations, however, did result in more reliance on RescueBot. Furthermore, compared to being silent, only being explainable results a higher situation awareness when interdependence is high. Results further show that being highly interdependent decreases trust, reliance, and team performance while increasing workload and situation awareness. High interdependence also increases human communication if the robot is not silent, human rescue contribution if the robot does not provide explanations, and the strength of the positive association between situation awareness and team performance. From these results, we can conclude that robot communication is crucial for human-robot teamwork, and that important differences exist between being transparent, explainable, or adaptive. Our findings also highlight the fundamental importance of interdependence in studies on explainability in robots.",4
902,First-in-human study of the safety and viability of intraocular robotic surgery,"Microsurgery of the retina would be dramatically improved by instruments that offer supra-human precision. Here, we report the results of a first-in-human study of remotely controlled robot-assisted retinal surgery performed through a telemanipulation device. Specifically, 12 patients requiring dissection of the epiretinal or inner limiting membrane over the macula were randomly assigned to either undergo robot-assisted-surgery or manual surgery, under general anaesthesia. We evaluated surgical success, duration of surgery and amount of retinal microtrauma as a proxy for safety. Surgical outcomes were equally successful in the robotic-surgery and manual-surgery groups. Differences in the amount of retinal microtrauma between the two groups were statistically insignificant, yet dissection took longer with robotic surgery (median time, 4 min 5 s) than with manual surgery (1 min 20 s). We also show the feasibility of using the robot to inject recombinant tissue plasminogen activator under the retina to displace sight-threatening haemorrhage in three patients under local anaesthesia. A safe and viable robotic system for intraocular surgery would enable precise and minimally traumatic delivery of gene therapy or cell therapy to the retina.",1
903,Speed Dating with Voice User Interfaces: Understanding How Families Interact and Perceive Voice User Interfaces in a Group Setting,"As voice-user interfaces (VUIs), such as smart speakers like Amazon Alexa or social robots like Jibo, enter multi-user environments like our homes, it is critical to understand how group members perceive and interact with these devices. VUIs engage socially with users, leveraging multi-modal cues including speech, graphics, expressive sounds, and movement. The combination of these cues can affect how users perceive and interact with these devices. Through a set of three elicitation studies, we explore family interactions (N = 34 families, 92 participants, ages 4-69) with three commercially available VUIs with varying levels of social embodiment. The motivation for these three studies began when researchers noticed that families interacted differently with three agents when familiarizing themselves with the agents and, therefore, we sought to further investigate this trend in three subsequent studies designed as a conceptional replication study. Each study included three activities to examine participants' interactions with and perceptions of the three VUIS in each study, including an agent exploration activity, perceived personality activity, and user experience ranking activity. Consistent for each study, participants interacted significantly more with an agent with a higher degree of social embodiment, i.e., a social robot such as Jibo, and perceived the agent as more trustworthy, having higher emotional engagement, and having higher companionship. There were some nuances in interaction and perception with different brands and types of smart speakers, i.e., Google Home versus Amazon Echo, or Amazon Show versus Amazon Echo Spot between the studies. In the last study, a behavioral analysis was conducted to investigate interactions between family members and with the VUIs, revealing that participants interacted more with the social robot and interacted more with their family members around the interactions with the social robot. This paper explores these findings and elaborates upon how these findings can direct future VUI development for group settings, especially in familial settings.",4
904,Robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in a patient with prostate cancer and complex urinary tract malformation,We present a case of prostate cancer with abnormal renal and ureteric anatomy who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. This is a 59-year-old European patient who presented with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and pelvic pain. Investigations revealed prostate cancer as well as a supernumerary right kidney and an atrophic horseshoe left kidney draining into the left seminal vesicle. He was managed with robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) using a modified technique. Selective pre-operative investigations and patient counselling led to proper operative planning and good surgical technique and outcome.,0
905,Ex vivo study of prostate cancer localization using rolling mechanical imaging towards minimally invasive surgery,"Rolling mechanical imaging (RMI) is a novel technique towards the detection and quantification of malignant tissue in locations that are inaccessible to palpation during robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS); the approach is shown to achieve results of higher precision than is possible using the human hand. Using a passive robotic manipulator, a lightweight and force sensitive wheeled probe is driven across the surface of tissue samples to collect continuous measurements of wheel-tissue dynamics. A color-coded map is then generated to visualize the stiffness distribution within the internal tissue structure. Having developed the RMI device in-house, we aim to compare the accuracy of this technique to commonly used methods of localizing prostate cancer in current practice: digital rectal exam (DRE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. Final histology is the gold standard used for comparison. A total of 126 sites from 21 robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy specimens were examined. Analysis was performed for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive value across all patient risk profiles (defined by PSA, Gleason score and pathological score). Of all techniques, pre-operative biopsy had the highest sensitivity (76.2%) and accuracy (64.3%) in the localization of tumor in the final specimen. However, RMI had a higher sensitivity (44.4%) and accuracy (57.9%) than both DRE (38.1% and 52.4%, respectively) and MRI (33.3% and 57.9%, respectively). These findings suggest a role for RMI towards MIS, where haptic feedback is lacking. While our approach has focused on urological tumors, RMI has potential applicability to other extirpative oncological procedures and to diagnostics (e.g., breast cancer screening).",0
906,What Is the Current Role and What Are the Prospects of the Robotic Approach in Liver Surgery?,"In parallel with the historical development of minimally invasive surgery, the laparoscopic and robotic approaches are now frequently utilized to perform major abdominal surgical procedures. Nevertheless, the role of the robotic approach in liver surgery is still controversial, and a standardized, safe technique has not been defined yet. This review aims to summarize the currently available evidence and prospects of robotic liver surgery. Minimally invasive liver surgery has been extensively associated with benefits, in terms of less blood loss, and lower complication rates, including liver-specific complications such as clinically relevant bile leakage and post hepatectomy liver failure, when compared to open liver surgery. Furthermore, comparable R0 resection rates to open liver surgery have been reported, thus, demonstrating the safety and oncological efficiency of the minimally invasive approach. However, whether robotic liver surgery has merits over laparoscopic liver surgery is still a matter of debate. In the current literature, robotic liver surgery has mainly been associated with non-inferior outcomes compared to laparoscopy, although it is suggested that the robotic approach has a shorter learning curve, lower conversion rates, and less intraoperative blood loss. Robotic surgical systems offer a more realistic image with integrated 3D systems. In addition, the improved dexterity offered by robotic surgical systems can lead to improved intra and postoperative outcomes. In the future, integrated and improved haptic feedback mechanisms, artificial intelligence, and the introduction of more liver-specific dissectors will likely be implemented, further enhancing the robots' abilities.",3
907,Development and Validation of a Nomogram Predicting Intraoperative Adverse Events During Robot-assisted Partial Nephrectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Ability to predict the risk of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) for patients undergoing partial nephrectomy (PN) can be of great clinical significance.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To develop and internally validate a preoperative nomogram predicting IOAEs for robot-assisted PN (RAPN).
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      In this observational study, data for demographic, preoperative, and postoperative variables for patients who underwent RAPN were extracted from the Vattikuti Collective Quality Initiative (VCQI) database.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      IOAEs were defined as the occurrence of intraoperative surgical complications, blood transfusion, or conversion to open surgery/radical nephrectomy. Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of IOAEs. The nomogram was validated using bootstrapping, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the goodness of fit. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to determine the clinical utility of the model.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Among the 2114 patients in the study cohort, IOAEs were noted in 158 (7.5%). Multivariable analysis identified five variables as independent predictors of IOAEs: RENAL nephrometry score (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.25); clinical tumor size (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.024); PN indication as absolute versus elective (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.6-5.7) and relative versus elective (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-8); Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30); and multifocal tumors (OR 8.8, 95% CI 5.4-14.1). A nomogram was developed using these five variables. The model was internally valid on bootstrapping and goodness of fit. The AUC estimated was 0.76 (95% CI 0.72-0.80). DCA revealed that the model was clinically useful at threshold probabilities >5%. Limitations include the lack of external validation and selection bias.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We developed and internally validated a nomogram predicting IOAEs during RAPN.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We developed a preoperative model than can predict complications that might occur during robotic surgery for partial removal of a kidney. Tests showed that our model is fairly accurate and it could be useful in identifying patients with kidney cancer for whom this type of surgery is suitable.",0
908,My Caregiver the Cobot: Comparing Visualization Techniques to Effectively Communicate Cobot Perception to People with Physical Impairments,"Nowadays, robots are found in a growing number of areas where they collaborate closely with humans. Enabled by lightweight materials and safety sensors, these cobots are gaining increasing popularity in domestic care, where they support people with physical impairments in their everyday lives. However, when cobots perform actions autonomously, it remains challenging for human collaborators to understand and predict their behavior, which is crucial for achieving trust and user acceptance. One significant aspect of predicting cobot behavior is understanding their perception and comprehending how they ""see"" the world. To tackle this challenge, we compared three different visualization techniques for Spatial Augmented Reality. All of these communicate cobot perception by visually indicating which objects in the cobot's surrounding have been identified by their sensors. We compared the well-established visualizations Wedge and Halo against our proposed visualization Line in a remote user experiment with participants suffering from physical impairments. In a second remote experiment, we validated these findings with a broader non-specific user base. Our findings show that Line, a lower complexity visualization, results in significantly faster reaction times compared to Halo, and lower task load compared to both Wedge and Halo. Overall, users prefer Line as a more straightforward visualization. In Spatial Augmented Reality, with its known disadvantage of limited projection area size, established off-screen visualizations are not effective in communicating cobot perception and Line presents an easy-to-understand alternative.",4
909,Is the Use of a Robotic Camera Holder Economically Viable? A Cost Comparison of Surgical Assistant Versus the Use of a Robotic Camera Holder in Laparoscopic Liver Resections,"The laparoscopic approach has gained acceptance in the field of hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery. It offers several advantages including reduced blood loss, reduced postoperative pain, and shorter length of stay. However, long operating times can be associated with surgeon and assistant fatigue and image tremor. Robotic camera holders have been designed to overcome these drawbacks but may come with significant costs. The aim of this study was to economically evaluate their use compared with standard assistants using a single surgeon consecutive series of laparoscopic liver resections from January 2014 to May 2015. Only use of nurse assistants with no advanced training and postgraduate year 2 doctors were cheaper than utilization of the device. We suggest the use of a robotic camera holder is cost-beneficial and may have wider service and educational benefits.",1
910,Establishing and integrating a transoral robotic surgery programme into routine oncological management of head and neck cancer - a UK perspective,"Background:
        
      
      The introduction of transoral robotic surgery into routine management of patients is complex. It involves organisational, logistical and clinical challenges. This study presents our experience of implementing such a programme and provides a blueprint for other centres willing to establish similar services.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Implementation of the robotic surgery programme focused on several key domains: training, logistics, governance, multidisciplinary team awareness, pre-operative imaging, anaesthesia, post-operative care, finance, patient selection and consent. Programme outcomes were evaluated by assessing operative outcomes of the first 117 procedures performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The success of the transoral robotic surgery programme has been possible because of the scrupulous planning phase before the first procedure, and the time invested on team awareness and training.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Implementation of a new transoral robotic surgery service has led to: the development of a dedicated transoral robotic surgery patient care protocol, the performance of progressively more complex procedures, the inclusion of transoral robotic surgery training and the establishment of several research projects.",1
911,Identification of Haptic Based Guiding Using Hard Reins,"This paper presents identifications of human-human interaction in which one person with limited auditory and visual perception of the environment (a follower) is guided by an agent with full perceptual capabilities (a guider) via a hard rein along a given path. We investigate several identifications of the interaction between the guider and the follower such as computational models that map states of the follower to actions of the guider and the computational basis of the guider to modulate the force on the rein in response to the trust level of the follower. Based on experimental identification systems on human demonstrations show that the guider and the follower experience learning for an optimal stable state-dependent novel 3rd and 2nd order auto-regressive predictive and reactive control policies respectively. By modeling the follower's dynamics using a time varying virtual damped inertial system, we found that the coefficient of virtual damping is most appropriate to explain the trust level of the follower at any given time. Moreover, we present the stability of the extracted guiding policy when it was implemented on a planar 1-DoF robotic arm. Our findings provide a theoretical basis to design advanced human-robot interaction algorithms applicable to a variety of situations where a human requires the assistance of a robot to perceive the environment.",0
912,"The introduction of an emergency safety protocol coupled with simulation training in robotic surgery, has enabled a more cohesive and efficient response to emergencies","With the increasing popularity of robotic surgery, arise a unique set of challenges. In-order to minimise the risk and optimise patient safety, teams need to anticipate these, plan and train to improve familiarity with the nuances of robotic surgery. Human factors and simulation training (ST) are now an integral part of surgery and we have extended these principles to our robotic practice. From our experience with emergencies and a thorough debrief, we have realised the importance of an emergency safety protocol (ESP) for the undocking of the robot, and how training with the correct systems in place optimises our non-technical skills and improves our efficiency. This protocol is used across all robotic specialties allowing for clear communication, situational awareness and role clarity, thereby reducing errors in a high-pressured environment. We aim to share our protocol, highlight the importance of ST and show that coupling of the ESP with ST, including addressing a disrupted power supply and how to avoid the resulting loss of image capture, is where our paper contributes to the current literature. There is a paucity in the literature regarding emergency undocking, and also techniques for avoiding power interruptions, for which we utilise the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system. By sharing experiences and systems used, we create an opportunity that will result in a culture of shared learning in the robotic community, thereby encouraging other robotic teams to review their protocols and training practices and adapt as necessary.",3
913,A qualitative exploration of care homes workers' views and training needs in relation to the use of socially assistive humanoid robots in their workplace,"Aim:
        
      
      The study aimed to explore the views and attitudes of care home workers about the socially assistive robot that was trialled in their workplace, in order to identify training needs in relation to the hypothetical future use of these robots in their workplace.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Care home workers face challenging workload conditions which may require the exploration of new solutions such as the use of socially assistive robots (SARs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a qualitative descriptive study which used semi-structured interviews. Care home workers (n = 23) in the UK participated in the study, and data collection took place between October 2019 and January 2020. NVivo software was used for data management, and a thematic inductive analysis was conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Findings indicated that many participants were open to the use of robots and valued the potential usefulness of SARs in the care setting. However, some participants showed resistance to the use of robots and did not feel comfortable with the idea of working alongside them. Participants wished to receive technical training that would enable them to be competent in using SARs. Participants took seriously their duty of care to the older people and thus wanted to ensure that the use of the SAR would not negatively impact on the care being provided. Robots were viewed as having potential to be supplementary to human carers, such as sharing the workload and improving upon the care already being provided.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Care home workers express both positive and negative views in relation to the hypothetical future deployment of socially assistive humanoid robots in their workplace.
    


          Implications for practice:
        
      
      The findings highlighted the importance of values around person-centred care which should be taken into account when planning for the implementation of robots in social care settings and training care home workers in how to work with robots.",6
914,Alternative to left ventricular lead implantation through the coronary sinus: 1-year experience with a minimally invasive and robotically guided approach,"Aims:
        
      
      Left ventricular (LV) lead implantation through the coronary sinus (CS) can be limited and sometimes not possible-alternative approaches are needed. Minimally invasive, robotically guided LV lead implantation has major advantages, but there are little published data about the short- and long-term follow-ups, in terms of feasibility, safety, electrical performance, and impact on clinical outcome.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      A total of 21 heart failure patients underwent robotically guided LV lead implantation using the Da Vinci Robotic System. Indications were failed implant with conventional approach through the CS (n = 16) and non-response to conventional cardiac resynchronization therapy (n = 5). During the procedure, the entire LV free wall was exposed through 3 transthoracic ports (10 mm diameter each) allowing ample choice of stimulation site and the ability to implant 2 LV leads via a Y connector. Patients were prospectively followed up for 1 year. The two LV leads were successfully implanted in all patients. No peri-procedural complications were observed. After a mean stay in the intensive care unit of 1.2 ± 4 days, the 21 patients were hospitalized in the EP department for 6.7 ± 2.9 days. Acute LV thresholds were excellent (1.0 V ± 0.6/0.4 ms) and stayed stable at 1-year follow-up (1.5 V ± 0.6/0.4 ms, P = 0.21). Four patients demonstrated an increased threshold (>2 V/0.4 ms). There was no phrenic nerve stimulation. After 12 months, in the failed implant group, 69% of the patients were echocardiographic and clinical responders.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The robotic approach was feasible, safe, and minimally invasive. Accordingly, robotically guided LV lead implantation seems to offer a new alternative when conventional approaches are not suitable.",0
915,Feasibility and safety of renal and visceral target vessel cannulation using robotically steerable catheters during complex endovascular aortic procedures,"Purpose:
        
      
      To evaluate the safety and success of target vessel cannulation in the visceral aortic segment using the Magellan robotic catheter system (RCS) during complex endovascular aortic procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Robotic navigation was attempted for access to 37 target vessels in 15 patients (14 men; mean age 75±10 years) during 16 fenestrated and/or branched stent-grafting procedures and 1 endovascular repair requiring the chimney technique. For each target vessel, robotic navigation was attempted for a maximum of 15 minutes; if cannulation was unsuccessful in that time, manual catheters were employed. Safety was evaluated by recording intraoperative adverse events, intraoperative complications related to robotic navigation, and postoperative complications. Technical success of robotic cannulation, wire cannulation times, and times for inserting the leader over the wire in the target vessels were recorded to assess RCS performance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Successful robotic cannulation was achieved for 30 (81%) of the 37 target vessels, with a median wire cannulation time of 263 seconds (range 40-780) and a median 15 seconds (range 5-450) for inserting the leader over the wire. No intraoperative complications related to robotic navigation were observed. Seven of 27 arteries accessed via 7 fenestrations could not be cannulated within 15 minutes; all were cannulated successfully using conventional catheters (mean cannulation time 31±7 minutes). All 10 target vessels accessed via branches and chimney stents were successfully cannulated with the RCS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Cannulation of target vessels with the RCS during complex endovascular aortic procedures is feasible and safe. The robotic system was particularly effective for branched and chimney stents.",8
916,Oncologic Outcomes After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Large European Single-centre Cohort with Median 10-Year Follow-up,"Background:
        
      
      Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment has been widely adopted with limited evidence for long-term (>5 yr) oncologic efficacy.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate long-term oncologic outcomes following RARP.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Prospective cohort study of 885 patients who underwent RARP as monotherapy for PCa between 2002 and 2006 in a single European centre and followed up until 2016.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      RARP as monotherapy.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (BCRFS), salvage therapy (ST)-free survival (STFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and event-time distributions were compared using the log-rank test. Variables predictive of BCR and ST were identified using Cox proportional hazards models.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      We identified 167 BCRs, 110 STs, 16 PCa-related deaths, and 51 deaths from other/unknown causes. BCRFS, STFS, CSS, and OS rates were 81.8%, 87.5%, 98.5%, and 93.0%, respectively, at median follow-up of 10.5 yr. On multivariable analysis, the strongest independent predictors of both BCR and ST were preoperative Gleason score, pathological T stage, positive surgical margins (PSMs), and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. PSM >3mm/multifocal but not ≤3mm independently affected the risk of both BCR and ST. Study limitations include a lack of centralised histopathologic reporting, lymph node and post-operative tumour volume data in a historical cohort, and patient-reported outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RARP appears to confer effective long-term oncologic efficacy. The risk of BCR or ST is unaffected by ≤3mm PSM, but further follow-up is required to determine any impact on CSS.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Robot-assisted surgery for prostate cancer is effective 10 yr after treatment. Very small (<3mm) amounts of cancer at the cut edge of the prostate do not appear to impact on recurrence risk and the need for additional treatment, but it is not yet known whether this affects the risk of death from prostate cancer.",2
917,Understanding Older Adult's Perceptions of Factors that Support Trust in Human and Robot Care Providers,"As the population of older adults increase so will the need for care providers, both human and robot. Trust is a key aspect to establish and maintain a successful older adult-care provider relationship. However, due to trust volatility it is essential to understand it within specific contexts. This proposed mixed methods study will explore what dimensions of trust emerge as important within the human-human and human-robot dyads in older adults and care providers. First, this study will help identify key qualities that support trust in a care provider relationship. By understanding what older adults perceive as needing to trust humans and robots for various care tasks, we can begin to provide recommendations based on user expectations for design to support trust.",4
918,Politeness in Human-Robot Interaction: A Multi-Experiment Study with Non-Humanoid Robots,"We studied politeness in human-robot interaction based on Lakoff's politeness theory. In a series of eight studies, we manipulated three different levels of politeness of non-humanoid robots and evaluated their effects. A table-setting task was developed for two different types of robots (a robotic manipulator and a mobile robot). The studies included two different populations (old and young adults) and were conducted in two conditions (video and live). Results revealed that polite robot behavior positively affected users' perceptions of the interaction with the robots and that participants were able to differentiate between the designed politeness levels. Participants reported higher levels of enjoyment, satisfaction, and trust when they interacted with the politest behavior of the robot. A smaller number of young adults trusted the politest behavior of the robot compared to old adults. Enjoyment and trust of the interaction with the robot were higher when study participants were subjected to the live condition compared to video and participants were more satisfied when they interacted with a mobile robot compared to a manipulator.",4
919,Multi-Robot Interfaces and Operator Situational Awareness: Study of the Impact of Immersion and Prediction,"Multi-robot missions are a challenge for operators in terms of workload and situational awareness. These operators have to receive data from the robots, extract information, understand the situation properly, make decisions, generate the adequate commands, and send them to the robots. The consequences of excessive workload and lack of awareness can vary from inefficiencies to accidents. This work focuses on the study of future operator interfaces of multi-robot systems, taking into account relevant issues such as multimodal interactions, immersive devices, predictive capabilities and adaptive displays. Specifically, four interfaces have been designed and developed: a conventional, a predictive conventional, a virtual reality and a predictive virtual reality interface. The four interfaces have been validated by the performance of twenty-four operators that supervised eight multi-robot missions of fire surveillance and extinguishing. The results of the workload and situational awareness tests show that virtual reality improves the situational awareness without increasing the workload of operators, whereas the effects of predictive components are not significant and depend on their implementation.",4
920,C-reactive protein as early predictor of complications after minimally invasive colorectal resection,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and enhanced recovery programs have been increasingly adopted in colorectal surgery. The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the usefulness of the C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration measured on postoperative day 3 (POD-3) as an early predictor of severe complications after minimally invasive colorectal resection.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      From January 2014 to December 2015, 160 patients underwent resection of colorectal disease by MIS at the Division of General and Hepatobiliary Surgery, University of Verona Hospital Trust. Among these, CRP measurement was available on POD-3 in 143 patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery was necessary in 18 patients (12.6%). The mean POD-3 CRP concentration was significantly higher in patients who did than did not require conversions (205.6 ± 89.6 mg/L versus 104.6 ± 85.8 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.001), even in the absence of postoperative complications, and these patients were therefore excluded from the subsequent analysis. No deaths occurred during the study period, but complications occurred in 39 patients (31.2%). Among these, 24 patients (61.5%) developed surgery-related complications. A POD-3 CRP concentration of 120 mg/L was highly reliable for excluding the occurrence of surgery-related and severe complications. The negative predictive values for excluding surgery-related and severe complications was 86.8% and 97.7%, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Assessment of the POD-3 CRP concentration after colorectal MIS is clinically significant for excluding the occurrence of surgery-related and severe complications. This measurement is a largely available, inexpensive, and easy-to-use tool that allows early and safe discharge in the setting of colorectal MIS and enhanced recovery programs.",3
921,A prospective analysis of robotic targeted MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy using the centroid targeting approach,"Robotic prostate biopsy is an emerging technology. Recent development of this tool has allowed the performance of a transperineal prostate biopsy allowing pre-programmed standardized biopsy schemes. Prospective data collection was undertaken in 86 consecutive men who underwent robotically assisted transperineal prostate biopsy. All underwent a multi-parametric MRI pre-biopsy with centroid targeting followed by systematic template prostate biopsy. For the purposes of this study, our definition of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is any Gleason score > 6. Mean (SD) age, median (IQR) PSA, and median (IQR) prostate volume were 64.24 (6.97) years, of 7.79 ng/ml (6.5) and 45.06 cc (28), respectively. Overall, 44 (51.2%) men were diagnosed with csPCa. csPCa was detected in the targeted biopsies alone in 35 (40.1%) men. The addition of the 12-zone template biopsy increased the yield of csPCa for another 9 (10.5%) men. Of these 9 men, the majority (7) harbored primary pattern 3 disease and only 1 was identified to have high-grade disease. Out of these 9 men, 7 of them had the identification of csPCa in the sector, where a target was contained within that zone. Robotic-assisted prostate biopsy in our study has demonstrated a high detection of csPCa when combined with limited near-field sampling. Our study suggests the use of more accurate biopsy schemes such as ring-targeting of lesions to mitigate against systematic and random mathematical errors. Adoption of this tool and biopsy strategy would potentially avoid the increased morbidity associated with whole gland systematic unguided biopsies.",1
922,Improving patient safety during introduction of novel medical devices through cumulative summation analysis,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to implement cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis as an early-warning detection and quality assurance system for preclinical testing of the iSYS1 novel robotic trajectory guidance system. METHODS Anatomically accurate 3D-printed skull phantoms were created for 3 patients who underwent implantation of 21 stereoelectroencephalography electrodes by surgeons using the current standard of care (frameless technique). Implantation schema were recreated using the iSYS1 system, and paired accuracy measures were compared with the previous frameless implantations. Entry point, target point, and implantation angle accuracy were measured on postimplantation CT scans. CUSUM analysis was undertaken prospectively. RESULTS The iSYS1 trajectory guidance system significantly improved electrode entry point accuracies from 1.90 ± 0.96 mm (mean ± SD) to 0.76 ± 0.57 mm (mean ± SD) without increasing implantation risk. CUSUM analysis was successful as a continuous measure of surgical performance and acted as an early-warning detection system. The surgical learning curve, although minimal, showed improvement after insertion of the eighth electrode. CONCLUSIONS The iSYS1 trajectory guidance system did not show any increased risk during phantom preclinical testing when used by neurosurgeons who had no experience with its use. CUSUM analysis is a simple technique that can be applied to all stages of the IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment) framework as an extra patient safety mechanism. Further clinical trials are required to prove the efficacy of the device.",0
923,Accuracy of navigated cam resection in femoroacetabular impingement: A randomised controlled trial,"Background:
        
      
      The main cause for revision hip arthroscopy surgery is incomplete bony resection of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). This study aimed to compare the cam resection accuracy via the conventional hip arthroscopy technique with the navigation technique.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two prospectively randomized groups were recruited: navigated (n = 15) and conventional (n = 14). A pre-operative CT and post-operative MRI scan were obtained in all cases to compare alpha angle, range of motion simulation and determine a pre-operative 3D surgical resection plan.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Post-operatively, the mean maximal alpha angle improved significantly in the navigated group compared with the conventional group (55°vs.66°; P = 0.023), especially in the 12 o' clock position (45°vs.60°; P = 0.041). However, positioning time and radiation exposure were significantly longer in the navigated group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Navigated surgery is effective for patients with cam type FAI in helping restore normal anatomy, however, not without drawbacks. Larger studies will be required to validate our results.",1
924,Randomized trial comparing robotic to manual ablation for atrial fibrillation,"Background:
        
      
      Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a physically demanding procedure for the operator, involving radiation exposure, and has limited success rates. Remote robotic navigation (RRN) may offer benefit to the procedure, though only 1 previous small randomized trial has assessed this.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to investigate the impact of RRN on 1-year single-procedure success rates.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      RRN was compared to manual ablation in a randomized control trial setting by using an intention-to-treat analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 157 patients underwent ablation (116/157 (74%) persistent AF; 67/116 (58%) of these long-standing persistent AF). There were no significant differences between the RRN and manual groups with respect to 1-year single-procedure success rates (19/78 (24%) and 26/78 (33%), respectively; P = .29), acute wide area circumferential ablation reconnection rates, complication rates, or procedure times. On multivariable analysis, fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter in the RRN group. The number of catheter displacements during ablation was lower in the RRN group, as was subjectively assessed operator fatigue. The crossover rate from RRN to manual ablation was 11/78 (14%), mainly secondary to technical problems with the RRN system. A learning curve was evident for RRN ablation: the fluoroscopy and procedure times were significantly lower after the first 10 cases in an operator's experience.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This randomized trial showed no difference in the success rate for catheter ablation of AF between a RRN and manual approach. The results highlight the learning curve for RRN ablation and suggest that the use of this technology leads to an improvement in fluoroscopy times, catheter stability, and operator fatigue.",1
925,Oncological outcomes of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy after more than 5 years,"Introduction:
        
      
      In the last 10 years, robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has become increasingly popular as witnessed by an increased number of publications. However, there is still little known about the long-term oncologic outcomes of this technique. The aim of this study is to assess the oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent RARP at least 5 years ago, with an emphasis on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      In 2004, RARP was introduced at our institutions. Records of all patients having RARP were prospectively collected in a dedicated database as part of the NUVOLA-BAUS project. For the present study, we selected only patients who had a follow-up of at least 5 years. Endpoints were BCRFS rate and 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, we identified 175 patients; 61.7 % of patients had Gleason 7-9 disease and 26.9 % had pT ≥ 3 disease at final pathology. Eight patients (4.5 %) had biochemical recurrence at follow-up. Overall 5-year BCRFS rate was 95.4 %, while it was 97.6, 91 and 50 % in pT2, pT3 and pT4 diseases, respectively. Among the patients who recurred, the mean time to recurrence was 22.1 ± 8.8 months. These patients received salvage external beam radiation treatment combined with hormonal therapy (anti-androgen + LHRH analogue) or hormonal therapy alone. 5-year CSS was 98.3 % (172/175): in 2 cases, the specimen showed pT4 cancer, while lymph node metastasis was noted in one case.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The 5-year BCRFS and CSS after RARP are encouraging even in a population with significant high-risk disease.",0
926,Trans-oral robotic cleft surgery (TORCS) for palate and posterior pharyngeal wall reconstruction: A feasibility study,"Background/aim:
        
      
      Robot-assisted surgery has become increasingly routine, replacing open and laparoscopic techniques in certain domains, with recent extension to head and neck surgery through trans-oral access. Some advantages of the robot-assisted surgery include the ability to access confined spaces, enhanced dexterity instrumentation with intuitive movement, motion scaling, tremor elimination and three-dimensional (3D) endoscopic viewing with true depth perception. The aim of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility of trans-oral robotic cleft surgery (TORCS) to access the posterior pharyngeal wall and palate for potential use in the cleft population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All possible permutations of patient and robotic instrument configurations were used with the daVinci Si Surgical System® (Intuitive Surgical, USA) 0° and 30° 3D endoscopes and 8-mm training instruments to determine the optimal visualization and surgical access to the palate and posterior pharynx in a paediatric airway manikin, and to simulate posterior pharyngeal wall surgery. A full robot-assisted cadaveric Hynes pharyngoplasty was performed using 5-mm training instruments. Experiments were recorded with still and video photography.
    


          Results:
        
      
      TORCS is technically feasible in the paediatric cleft population. We predict a short learning curve due to the intuitive instrumentation, easier dissection and the potential to limit secondary insult compared with traditional surgery, as well as improved ergonomics for the operating surgeon.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The as-yet unreported use of robotic-assisted cleft palate surgery may considerably enhance a surgeon's ability to perform difficult procedures of the palate and posterior pharynx in selected patients with limited access as well as lay the foundation for potential novel techniques.",1
927,Evolution of male rectal prolapse surgery and initial experience of robotic rectopexy in men,"Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) has proven benefit in the treatment of external rectal prolapse and symptomatic internal rectal prolapse in women. However, there is a recurrence rate of 4-50% depending on indication. Some of this recurrence is attributable to persistent lateral and posterior prolapses. Modifications of LVMR (modified Orr-Loygue rectopexies) describe an additional narrow posterior rectal mesh fixed to the mesorectal fat, which is inherently insecure. Additional complications in men include sexual dysfunction caused by nerve damage from the ventral rectal dissection. There is one case series in men, published by a surgeon with an unusually large practice, showing LVMR to have a good success rate with low rates of sexual dysfunction. Other series have contained small numbers of men, but subgroup analysis to determine success and complication rates is not possible. Robotic surgery is more precise than laparoscopic surgery, allows stereotactic vision, and has a stable platform. We have developed a robotic modified Orr-Loygue rectopexy in an attempt to deal with the persistent components of posterior rectal prolapse by placing a mesh posteriorly through a narrow dissection and securing the mesh to the distal rectal muscle tube. Mesh-to-muscle fixation is more secure than mesh-to-mesorectal fat fixation. The robotic platform also improves the accuracy of ventral dissection and reduces the risk of sexual dysfunction in men. Our initial results indicate that robotic modified Orr-Loygue rectopexy is a safe and feasible option for rectal prolapse in men, with no more complications or recurrences than the best published outcomes for LVMR.",2
928,Mathematical representation of the normal proximal human femur: application in planning of cam hip surgery,"Precise modelling of the proximal femur can be used for detecting and planning corrective surgery for subjects with deformed femurs using robotic technology or navigation systems. In this study, the proximal femoral geometry has been modelled mathematically. It is hypothesised that it is possible to fit a quadratic surface or combinations of them onto different bone surfaces with a relatively good fit. Forty-six computed tomography datasets of normal proximal femora were segmented. A least-squares fitting algorithm was used to fit a quadratic surface on the femoral head and neck such that the sum of distances between a set of points on the femoral neck and the quadratic surface was minimised. Furthermore, the position of the head-neck articular margin was also measured. The femoral neck was found to be represented as a good fit to a hyperboloid with an average root mean-squared error of 1.0 ± 0.13 mm while the shape of the femoral articular margin was a reproducible sinusoidal wave form with two peaks. The mathematical description in this study can be used for planning corrective surgery for subjects with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement.",0
929,The current status of robotic colorectal surgery training programmes,"Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery (RACS) is steadily increasing in popularity with an annual growth in the number of colorectal procedures undertaken robotically. Further upscaling of RACS requires structured and standardised robotic training to safeguard high-quality clinical outcomes. The aims of this systematic review were to assess the structure and assessment metrics of currently established RACS training programmes. A systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines was performed. Searches were performed of the Ovid Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases between 2000 and 27th November 2021 to identify studies reporting on training curricula in RACS. Core components of training programmes and their relevant outcome assessment metrics were extracted. Thirteen studies were identified, with all training programmes designed for the da Vinci platform (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Common elements of multimodal programmes included theoretical knowledge (76.9%), case observation (53.8%), simulation (100%) and proctored training (76.9%). Robotic skills acquisition was assessed primarily during the simulation phase (n = 4, 30.1%) and proctoring phase (n = 10, 76.9%). Performance metrics, consisting of time or assessment scores for VR simulation were only mandated in four (30.1%) studies. Objective assessment following proctored training was variably reported and employed a range of assessment metrics, including direct feedback (n = 3, 23.1%) or video feedback (n = 8, 61.5%). Five (38.4%) training programmes used the Global Assessment Score (GAS) forms. There is a broad consensus on the core multimodal components across current RACS training programmes; however, validated objective assessment is limited and needs to be appropriately standardised to ensure reproducible progression criteria and competency-based metrics are produced to robustly assess progression and competence.",3
930,Blockchain-Empowered Multi-Robot Collaboration to Fight COVID-19 and Future Pandemics,"This conceptual paper overviews how blockchain technology is involving the operation of multi-robot collaboration for combating COVID-19 and future pandemics. Robots are a promising technology for providing many tasks such as spraying, disinfection, cleaning, treating, detecting high body temperature/mask absence, and delivering goods and medical supplies experiencing an epidemic COVID-19. For combating COVID-19, many heterogeneous and homogenous robots are required to perform different tasks for supporting different purposes in the quarantine area. Managmnt and decentralizing multi-robot play a vital role in combating COVID-19 by reducing human interaction, monitoring, delivering goods. Blockchain technology can manage multi-robot collaboration in a decentralized fashion, improve the interaction among them to exchange information, share representation, share goals, and trust. We highlight the challenges and provide the tactical solutions enabled by integrating blockchain and multi-robot collaboration to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed conceptual framework can increase the intelligence, decentralization, and autonomous operations of connected multi-robot collaboration in the blockchain network. We overview blockchain potential benefits to defining a framework of multi-robot collaboration applications to combat COVID-19 epidemics such as monitoring and outdoor and hospital End to End (E2E) delivery systems. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrated blockchain, multi-robot collaboration, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for combating COVID-19 and future pandemics.",4
931,De-intensified adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy versus standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy post transoral minimally invasive surgery for resectable HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma,"Background:
        
      
      More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) are diagnosed every year worldwide and this is rising. Much of the increase has been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-positive OPSCC patients are often younger and have significantly improved survival relative to HPV-negative patients. Traditional management of OPSCC has been with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, as this was shown to have similar survival to open surgery but with significantly lower morbidity. Techniques have evolved, however, with the development of computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and of minimally invasive surgical techniques. Acute and late toxicities associated with chemoradiotherapy are a significant burden for OPSCC patients and with an ever-younger cohort, any strategies that could decrease treatment-associated morbidity should be investigated.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effects of de-intensified adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in comparison to standard adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in patients treated with minimally invasive transoral surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for resectable HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 26 April 2018.
    


          Selection criteria:
        
      
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary HPV-positive squamous cell tumours originating from the oropharyngeal mucosa. Tumours were classified as T1-4a with or without nodal spread and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by de-intensified adjuvant therapy (either omission of chemotherapy or reduced-dose radiotherapy). The comparator was minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy or standard-dose radiotherapy. The treatments received were of curative intent and patients had not undergone any prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.
    


          Data collection and analysis:
        
      
      We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related survival was to be studied where possible) and disease-free survival, measured at one, two, three and five years. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of swallowing ability and voice, measured at one, six, 12 and 24 months. We planned to use GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      We did not identify any completed RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. However, three eligible studies are in progress:ADEPT is a phase III trial comparing postoperative radiotherapy with or without cisplatin in HPV-positive T1-4a OPSCC patients. Included patients must have received minimally invasive surgery and demonstrated extra-capsular spread from disease in the neck.ECOG-E3311 is a phase II trial of treatment for HPV-positive locally advanced OPSCC (stages III-IVa + IVb without distant metastasis). Patients are stratified after minimally invasive surgery. Medium-risk patients are randomised to either standard or reduced-dose radiotherapy.PATHOS is a phase III trial of treatment for HPV-positive OPSCC (T1-3, N0-2b). Patients are stratified after minimally invasive surgery. Medium-risk patients are randomised to either standard or reduced-dose radiotherapy. High-risk patients are randomised to radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin.
    


          Authors' conclusions:
        
      
      This review highlights the current lack of high-quality randomised controlled trials studying treatment de-escalation after minimally invasive surgery in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. However, trials that will meet the inclusion criteria for this review are in progress with results expected between 2021 and 2023.",1
932,Consumer acceptance of autonomous delivery robots for last-mile delivery: Technological and health perspectives,"The unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus has led to a great shift toward online retailing and accelerated the need for contactless delivery. This study investigates how technological and health belief factors influence consumer acceptance of autonomous delivery robots (ADRs). Anchored in four behavioral theories [i.e., technology acceptance model, health belief model, perceived value (VAL) theory and trust theory], a synthesized model is developed. A total of 500 valid responses were collected through an online questionnaire in Singapore, and structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the responses. The results revealed that perceived ease of use (EOU), perceived usefulness (UFN), perceived susceptibility (SUS), perceived severity (SEV), self-efficacy (SEL) and cues to action (CUE) have a positive and significant influence on consumers' perceptions of the value of ADRs. The total effect analysis also showed that perceived VAL strongly affects consumer acceptance of ADRs. Academically, this study introduces both technological and health belief factors to explain consumer acceptance of ADRs. It also provides recommendations for policymakers and autonomous delivery robot developers on policy formulation, public communication, product design and infrastructure development.",4
933,Subjective Trusts for the Control of Mobile Robots under Uncertainty,"The paper deals with the methods of handling imperfect information and the control of mobile robots acting under uncertainty. It is assumed that the robots act in autonomous regime and are controlled internally without referring the externally defined probabilities of the states and actions. To control the activity of the robots, we suggest the novel multi-valued logic techniques based on the recently developed measures, known as the subjective trusts. In addition to specification of the robots' movements, such a technique allows for direct definition of the robots' swarming using the methods of artificial neural networks with mobile neurons. The suggested methods are verified by numerical simulations and running examples. The resulting framework forms a basis for processing non-probabilistic uncertainties and making individual decisions with imperfect information.",4
934,A hand-guided robotic drill for cochleostomy on human cadavers,"Background:
        
      
      An arm supported robotic drill has been recently demonstrated for preparing cochleostomies in a pilot research clinical trial. In this paper, a hand-guided robotic drill is presented and tested on human cadaver trials.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The innovative smart tactile approach can automatically detect drilling mediums and decided when to stop drilling to prevent penetrating the endosteum. The smart sensing scheme has been implemented in a concept of a hand guided robotic drill.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Experiments were carried out on two adult cadaveric human bodies for verifying the drilling process and successfully finished cochleostomy on three cochlea. The advantage over a system supported by a mechanical arm includes the flexibility in adjusting the trajectory to initiate cutting without slipping. Using the same concept as a conventional drilling device, the user will also be benefit from the lower setup time and cost, and lower training overhead.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The hand-guided robotic drill was recently developed for testing on human cadavers. The robotic drill successfully prepared cochleostomies in all three cases.",1
935,Koopman Operator-Based Knowledge-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Safe Human-Robot Interaction,"We developed a novel framework for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in task constrained path generation problems of robotic manipulators leveraging human demonstrated trajectories. The main contribution of this article is to design a reward function that can be used with generic reinforcement learning algorithms by utilizing the Koopman operator theory to build a human intent model from the human demonstrated trajectories. In order to ensure that the developed reward function produces the correct reward, the demonstrated trajectories are further used to create a trust domain within which the Koopman operator-based human intent prediction is considered. Otherwise, the proposed algorithm asks for human feedback to receive rewards. The designed reward function is incorporated inside the deep Q-learning (DQN) framework, which results in a modified DQN algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm is demonstrated using a simulated robotic arm to learn the paths for constrained end-effector motion and considering the safety of the human in the surroundings of the robot.",2
936,Dimensionality Reduction in Controlling Articulated Snake Robot for Endoscopy Under Dynamic Active Constraints,"This paper presents a real-time control framework for a snake robot with hyper-kinematic redundancy under dynamic active constraints for minimally invasive surgery. A proximity query (PQ) formulation is proposed to compute the deviation of the robot motion from predefined anatomical constraints. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to any snake robot represented as a set of control vertices. The proposed PQ formulation is implemented on a graphic processing unit, allowing for fast updates over 1 kHz. We also demonstrate that the robot joint space can be characterized into lower dimensional space for smooth articulation. A novel motion parameterization scheme in polar coordinates is proposed to describe the transition of motion, thus allowing for direct manual control of the robot using standard interface devices with limited degrees of freedom. Under the proposed framework, the correct alignment between the visual and motor axes is ensured, and haptic guidance is provided to prevent excessive force applied to the tissue by the robot body. A resistance force is further incorporated to enhance smooth pursuit movement matched to the dynamic response and actuation limit of the robot. To demonstrate the practical value of the proposed platform with enhanced ergonomic control, detailed quantitative performance evaluation was conducted on a group of subjects performing simulated intraluminal and intracavity endoscopic tasks.",0
937,Active inference and robot control: a case study,"Active inference is a general framework for perception and action that is gaining prominence in computational and systems neuroscience but is less known outside these fields. Here, we discuss a proof-of-principle implementation of the active inference scheme for the control or the 7-DoF arm of a (simulated) PR2 robot. By manipulating visual and proprioceptive noise levels, we show under which conditions robot control under the active inference scheme is accurate. Besides accurate control, our analysis of the internal system dynamics (e.g. the dynamics of the hidden states that are inferred during the inference) sheds light on key aspects of the framework such as the quintessentially multimodal nature of control and the differential roles of proprioception and vision. In the discussion, we consider the potential importance of being able to implement active inference in robots. In particular, we briefly review the opportunities for modelling psychophysiological phenomena such as sensory attenuation and related failures of gain control, of the sort seen in Parkinson's disease. We also consider the fundamental difference between active inference and optimal control formulations, showing that in the former the heavy lifting shifts from solving a dynamical inverse problem to creating deep forward or generative models with dynamics, whose attracting sets prescribe desired behaviours.",4

By enabling automation and enhancing labour efficiency, Industry 5.0 has made it possible to engineer patient-specific tools, instruments and implants to improve clinical, functional, and Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROMs).",1
939,The Active Inference Approach to Ecological Perception: General Information Dynamics for Natural and Artificial Embodied Cognition,"The emerging neurocomputational vision of humans as embodied, ecologically embedded, social agents-who shape and are shaped by their environment-offers a golden opportunity to revisit and revise ideas about the physical and information-theoretic underpinnings of life, mind, and consciousness itself. In particular, the active inference framework (AIF) makes it possible to bridge connections from computational neuroscience and robotics/AI to ecological psychology and phenomenology, revealing common underpinnings and overcoming key limitations. AIF opposes the mechanistic to the reductive, while staying fully grounded in a naturalistic and information-theoretic foundation, using the principle of free energy minimization. The latter provides a theoretical basis for a unified treatment of particles, organisms, and interactive machines, spanning from the inorganic to organic, non-life to life, and natural to artificial agents. We provide a brief introduction to AIF, then explore its implications for evolutionary theory, ecological psychology, embodied phenomenology, and robotics/AI research.

940,Robot-Assisted Versus Conventional Freehand Fluoroscopy-Guided Percutaneous Screw Fixation in Femoral Neck Fractures: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Robotic-assisted navigation for percutaneous femoral neck fracture fixation is a new technology that has shown enhanced intraoperative and postoperative outcomes compared to the conventional freehand fluoroscopy-guided technique. The authors aim to compare robot-assisted femoral neck fracture fixation to conventional freehand fluoroscopy-guided repair. Electronic databases were searched, identifying all observational studies comparing outcomes of both groups. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The primary outcomes included operative duration (minutes), intraoperative bleeding (mL), fluoroscopy exposure, and frequency of intraoperative drilling. The secondary outcomes included Harris scores, healing rate and time, screw accuracy, and postoperative complications. Seven observational studies were identified, enrolling 506 patients. There was a significant difference between the robot-assisted and conventional groups in terms of intraoperative blood loss (mean difference (MD) = -18.83, p ≤ 0.05), fluoroscopy exposure (MD = -1.81, p ≤ 0.05), and intraoperative drilling frequency (MD = -7.35, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in operative duration between the groups (MD = -0.21, p = 0.66). Most secondary outcomes were improved in the robot-assisted group. Overall, robot-assisted fixation was superior in terms of safety and efficacy.",1
941,Image guidance for all--TilePro display of 3-dimensionally reconstructed images in robotic partial nephrectomy,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine the feasibility of a novel low-barrier-to-entry image guidance system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Initially a randomized crossover study was performed to establish the interface (iPad or 3-dimensional mouse) that minimized both the amount of time required to perform a manual image registration and the error of that registration. A subsequent clinical feasibility study was undertaken on 5 patients undergoing robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. Randomized crossover study primary outcomes were time to task completion, NASA-Task Load Index score, and alignment error (translational and rotational). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups. Surgeon feedback was sought when assessing the system in a clinical setting.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the initial randomized crossover study, the iPad-based system was able to achieve adequate alignment accuracy (Frobenius norm of 0.3; total error of 20.8 mm) in significantly less time (33 seconds; P<.01) than the 3-dimensional mouse interface. The platform received good feedback from the operating surgeon in all instances with the surgeon commenting particularly on the improved appreciation of hilar vascular anatomy.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of a ""low-barrier-to-entry"" image guidance system in a clinical setting. The system was able to achieve swift and sufficiently accurate alignment, with little impact on the surgical workflow.",0
942,"The burden of performing minimal access surgery: ergonomics survey results from 462 surgeons across Germany, the UK and the USA","This international study aimed to understand, from the perspective of surgeons, their experience of performing minimal access surgery (MAS), to explore causes of discomfort while operating and the impact of poor ergonomics on surgeon welfare and career longevity across different specialties and techniques. A quantitative online survey was conducted in Germany, the UK and the USA from March to April 2019. The survey comprised 17 questions across four categories: demographics, intraoperative discomfort, effects on performance and anticipated consequences. In total, 462 surgeons completed the survey. Overall, 402 (87.0%) surgeons reported experiencing discomfort while operating at least 'sometimes'. The peak professional performance age was perceived to be 45-49 years by 30.7% of surgeons, 50-54 by 26.4% and older than 55 by 10.1%. 86 (18.6%) surgeons felt it likely they would consider early retirement, of whom 83 were experiencing discomfort. Our findings highlight the continued unmet needs of surgeons performing MAS, with the overwhelming majority experiencing discomfort, frequently in the back, neck and shoulders, and many likely to consider early retirement consequently. Innovative solutions are needed to alleviate this physical burden and, in turn, prevent economic and societal impacts on healthcare systems resulting from MAS limiting surgeon longevity.",3
943,Adapting proportional myoelectric-controlled interfaces for prosthetic hands,"Powered hand prostheses with many degrees of freedom are moving from research into the market for prosthetics. In order to make use of the prostheses' full functionality, it is essential to find efficient ways to control their multiple actuators. Human subjects can rapidly learn to employ electromyographic (EMG) activity of several hand and arm muscles to control the position of a cursor on a computer screen, even if the muscle-cursor map contradicts directions in which the muscles would act naturally. We investigated whether a similar control scheme, using signals from four hand muscles, could be adopted for real-time operation of a dexterous robotic hand. Despite different mapping strategies, learning to control the robotic hand over time was surprisingly similar to the learning of two-dimensional cursor control.",4
944,Patient quality of life and short-term surgical outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic anterior resection for adenocarcinoma of the rectum,"Purpose:
        
      
      To compare patient quality of life (QoL) and short-term surgical outcomes between robotic anterior resection (r-AR) and laparoscopic (l-AR) approach.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive patients having undergone either robotic or laparoscopic AR for adenocarcinoma were studied. All operations were performed by two surgeons experienced in laparoscopic and recently introduced robotic surgery. Surgical outcomes were determined by post-operative histology and short-term complications. QoL was prospectively assessed using the EORTC QLC-CR30 and QLC-CR29 questionnaires.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 36 patients (18 r-AR) with a median follow-up of 12 months following surgery (9-month robotic and 20-month laparoscopic) were studied. The two groups were similarly matched for age and gender. Laparoscopic patients had a lower ASA grade (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in surgical outcomes between groups. r-AR patients reported lower pain scales (2 ± 6 vs. 11 ± 13) (p = 0.04), lower levels of insomnia 0 vs. 8 ± 15 (p = 0.04) and a lower abdominal pain scale (2 ± 9 vs. 17 ± 27) (p = 0.04). Male impotence scores were higher in l-AR 33 ± 35 compared to r-AR 7 ± 21 (p = 0.03).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Despite its recent introduction to our centre, the quality of oncological resection using the robotic surgery is comparable to laparoscopy. Lower impotence and QoL scores in patients after robotic procedure may be explained on the basis of better visualisation and precise tissue handling.",8
945,Performance with robotic surgery versus 3D- and 2D-laparoscopy during pancreatic and biliary anastomoses in a biotissue model: pooled analysis of two randomized trials,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic surgery may improve surgical performance during minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy as compared to 3D- and 2D-laparoscopy but comparative studies are lacking. This study assessed the impact of robotic surgery versus 3D- and 2D-laparoscopy on surgical performance and operative time using a standardized biotissue model for pancreatico- and hepatico-jejunostomy using pooled data from two randomized controlled crossover trials (RCTs).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Pooled analysis of data from two RCTs with 60 participants (36 surgeons, 24 residents) from 11 countries (December 2017-July 2019) was conducted. Each included participant completed two pancreatico- and two hepatico-jejunostomies in biotissue using 3D-robotic surgery, 3D-laparoscopy, or 2D-laparoscopy. Primary outcomes were the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS: 12-60) rating, scored by observers blinded for 3D/2D and the operative time required to complete both anastomoses. Sensitivity analysis excluded participants with excess experience compared to others.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 220 anastomoses were completed (robotic 80, 3D-laparoscopy 70, 2D-laparoscopy 70). Participants in the robotic group had less surgical experience [median 1 (0-2) versus 6 years (4-12), p < 0.001], as compared to the laparoscopic group. Robotic surgery resulted in higher OSATS ratings (50, 43, 39 points, p = .021 and p < .001) and shorter operative time (56.5, 65.0, 81.5 min, p = .055 and p < .001), as compared to 3D- and 2D-laparoscopy, respectively, which remained in the sensitivity analysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In a pooled analysis of two RCTs in a biotissue model, robotic surgery resulted in better surgical performance scores and shorter operative time for biotissue pancreatic and biliary anastomoses, as compared to 3D- and 2D-laparoscopy.",5
946,Short-term surgical outcomes and patient quality of life between robotic and laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision for adenocarcinoma of the rectum,"Introduction Some studies advocate a laparoscopic extralevator abdominoperineal excision (l-ELAPE) approach for low rectal cancer. The da Vinci™ robot (r-ELAPE) technique has potential to overcome some limitations of l-ELAPE, such as reduction of the learning curve and more precise tissue handling. It is unknown whether this approach results in improved surgical or quality of life outcomes compared with l-ELAPE. This study aimed to address this issue. Methods Consecutive patients having undergone either robotic or laparoscopic ELAPE for adenocarcinoma were studied. All operations were performed by two surgeons experienced in laparoscopic and recently introduced robotic surgery. Surgical outcomes were determined by postoperative histology and short-term complications. Quality of life was prospectively assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLC-CR30 and QLC-CR29 questionnaires. Results A total of 22 patients (11 r-ELAPE) with a median follow-up of 13 months (8 months robotic; 22 months laparoscopic) were studied. The groups were similarly matched for age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, preoperative chemoradiotherapy and tumour height. All had R0 resection. There was no significant difference in short-term surgical outcomes between groups. There was no significant difference in mean global health scores between the two groups (74 ± 14 r-ELAPE vs. 73 ± 10 l-ELAPE). The r-ELAPE group had a lower mean impotence score compared with the I-ELAPE group (55.5 ± 40 vs. 72.2 ± 44), although this was not statistically significant. Conclusions The newly introduced r-ELAPE was non-inferior to l-ELAPE in either patient quality of life or surgical outcomes. Robotic surgery could be particularly beneficial in the technically challenging area of low rectal cancer surgery with a shorter learning curve than laparoscopy.",1
947,Robotic partial nephrectomy for duplex kidney with ectopic ureter draining in the vagina in an adult patient with urinary incontinence,"A duplex kidney system with an ectopic ureter draining into the vagina is a congenital malformation that typically presents as refractory urinary incontinence. Diagnosis is often difficult to establish and delayed due to a low incidence. We present the case of a patient aged 26 years with a life-long history of persistent urinary incontinence. Initial presentation was at childhood; however, the diagnosis went undetermined for 22 years. CT urography revealed a duplex kidney with an atrophic upper pole associated with an ectopic ureter that drained into the vaginal vault. This is the first description of such a case being managed successfully via a robot-assisted partial nephrectomy approach. Ectopic ureteral duplication should be considered in the differential diagnosis for young women with refractory urinary incontinence. Robotic partial nephrectomy is a safe and effective technique to manage such cases.",0
948,Surgical margin length and location affect recurrence rates after robotic prostatectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is a current standard treatment for localized prostate cancer, with treatment failure defined by biochemical recurrence (BCR). Open radical prostatectomy series have identified the presence of a positive surgical margin (PSM) as a predictor of long-term recurrence, a measure that is affected by the surgeon׳s skill. We evaluate the effect of PSM parameters on BCR rates from robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, across 3 high-volume institutions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      De-identifiable clinicopathological and histopathological data were prospectively collected for 4,001 patients with at least 3 years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier plots and 3 statistical models were used to evaluate the effect of margin parameters on BCR, via crude rates, traditional multivariable Cox regression, and a propensity-adjusted Cox regression model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 37% of men with a PSM developed BCR compared with 10% of men with negative margins (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47-2.22). Length ≥3 mm or a multifocal positive margin was associated with a higher risk of BCR compared with negative margin cases. On multivariable Cox regression analysis of the positive margin cohort, only apical margins significantly predicted BCR relative to basal margins (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.01-4.09), whereas there was no significant difference in BCR rates for posterolateral margins relative to basal margins (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 0.84-3.11). Propensity-adjusted modeling confirmed a greater effect of apical compared with posterolateral PSM.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A PSM length ≥3 mm is predictive of BCR, as is to a lesser extent multiple positive margins. In contrast to open prostatectomy series, posterolateral margins carry a smaller risk of BCR compared with apical margins.",2
949,Current Limitations of Surgical Robotics in Reconstructive Plastic Microsurgery,"Surgical robots have the potential to provide surgeons with increased capabilities, such as removing physiologic tremor, scaling motion and increasing manual dexterity. Several surgical specialties have subsequently integrated robotic surgery into common clinical practice. Plastic and reconstructive microsurgical procedures have not yet benefitted significantly from technical developments observed over the last two decades. Several studies have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of utilising surgical robots in plastic surgery procedures, yet limited work has been done to identify and analyse current barriers that have prevented wide-scale adaptation of surgical robots for microsurgery. Therefore, a systematic review using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases was performed, in order to evaluate current state of surgical robotics within the field of reconstructive microsurgery and their limitations. Despite the theoretical potential of surgical robots, current commercially available robotic systems are suboptimal for plastic or reconstructive microsurgery. Absence of bespoke microsurgical instruments, increases in operating time, and high costs associated with robotic-assisted provide a barrier to using such systems effectively for reconstructive microsurgery. Consequently, surgical robots provide currently little overall advantage over conventional microsurgery. Nevertheless, if current barriers can be addressed and systems are specifically designed for microsurgery, surgical robots may have the potential of meaningful impact on clinical outcomes within this surgical subspeciality.",1
950,Is It Me or the Robot? A Critical Evaluation of Human Affective State Recognition in a Cognitive Task,"A key goal in human-robot interaction (HRI) is to design scenarios between humanoid robots and humans such that the interaction is perceived as collaborative and natural, yet safe and comfortable for the human. Human skills like verbal and non-verbal communication are essential elements as humans tend to attribute social behaviors to robots. However, aspects like the uncanny valley and different technical affinity levels can impede the success of HRI scenarios, which has consequences on the establishment of long-term interaction qualities like trust and rapport. In the present study, we investigate the impact of a humanoid robot on human emotional responses during the performance of a cognitively demanding task. We set up three different conditions for the robot with increasing levels of social cue expressions in a between-group study design. For the analysis of emotions, we consider the eye gaze behavior, arousal-valence for affective states, and the detection of action units. Our analysis reveals that the participants display a high tendency toward positive emotions in presence of a robot with clear social skills compared to other conditions, where we show how emotions occur only at task onset. Our study also shows how different expression levels influence the analysis of the robots' role in HRI. Finally, we critically discuss the current trend of automatized emotion or affective state recognition in HRI and demonstrate issues that have direct consequences on the interpretation and, therefore, claims about human emotions in HRI studies.",4
951,A tale of two explanations: Enhancing human trust by explaining robot behavior,"The ability to provide comprehensive explanations of chosen actions is a hallmark of intelligence. Lack of this ability impedes the general acceptance of AI and robot systems in critical tasks. This paper examines what forms of explanations best foster human trust in machines and proposes a framework in which explanations are generated from both functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstrations to open medicine bottles using (i) an embodied haptic prediction model to extract knowledge from sensory feedback, (ii) a stochastic grammar model induced to capture the compositional structure of a multistep task, and (iii) an improved Earley parsing algorithm to jointly leverage both the haptic and grammar models. The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles. Using different forms of explanations generated by the robot system, we conducted a psychological experiment to examine what forms of explanations best foster human trust in the robot. We found that comprehensive and real-time visualizations of the robot's internal decisions were more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text descriptions. In addition, forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to the model components contributing to the best task performance. This divergence shows a need for the robotics community to integrate model components to enhance both task execution and human trust in machines.",4
952,Recurrence patterns after open and robot-assisted radical cystectomy for bladder cancer,"Background:
        
      
      Concerns remain whether robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) compromises survival because of inadequate oncologic resection or alteration of recurrence patterns.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To describe recurrence patterns following open radical cystectomy (ORC) and RARC.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Retrospective review of 383 consecutive patients who underwent ORC (n=120) or RARC (n=263) at an academic institution from July 2001 to February 2014.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      ORC and RARC.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Recurrence-free survival estimates were illustrated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Recurrence patterns (local vs distant and anatomic locations) within 2 yr of surgery were tabulated. Cox regression models were built to evaluate the effect of surgical technique on the risk of recurrence.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      The median follow-up time for patients without recurrence was 30 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 5-72) for ORC and 23 mo (IQR 9-48) for RARC (p=0.6). Within 2 yr of surgery, there was no large difference in the number of local recurrences between ORC and RARC patients (15/65 [23%] vs 24/136 [18%]), and the distribution of local recurrences was similar between the two groups. Similarly, the number of distant recurrences did not differ between the groups (26/73 [36%] vs 43/147 [29%]). However, there were distinct patterns of distant recurrence. Extrapelvic lymph node locations were more frequent for RARC than ORC (10/43 [23%] vs 4/26 [15%]). Furthermore, peritoneal carcinomatosis was found in 9/43 (21%) RARC patients compared to 2/26 (8%) ORC patients. In multivariable analyses, RARC was not a predictor of recurrence. Limitations of the study include selection bias and a limited sample size.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Within limitations, we found that RARC is not an independent predictor of recurrence after surgery. Interestingly, extrapelvic lymph node locations and peritoneal carcinomatosis were more frequent in RARC than in ORC patients. Further validation is warranted to better understand the oncologic implications of RARC.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this study, the locations of bladder cancer recurrences following conventional and robotic techniques for removal of the bladder are described. Although the numbers are small, the results show that the distribution of distant recurrences differs between the two techniques.",2
953,Utilizing Telemedicine in the Trauma Intensive Care Unit: Does It Impact Teamwork?,"Background:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a telemedical robot on trauma intensive care unit (TICU) clinician teamwork (i.e., team attitudes, behaviors, and cognitions) during patient rounds.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Thirty-two healthcare providers who conduct rounds volunteered to take surveys assessing teamwork attitudes and cognitions at three time periods: (1) the onset of the study, (2) the end of the 30-day control period, and (3) the end of the 30-day experimental period, which immediately followed the control period. Rounds were recorded throughout the 30-day control period and 30-day experimental period to observe provider behaviors. For the initial 30 days, there was no access to telemedicine. For the final 30 days, the rounding healthcare providers had access to the RP-7 robot (Intouch Health Inc., Santa Barbara, CA), a telemedical tool that can facilitate patient rounds conducted away from bedside.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using a one-tailed, one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare trust at Times 1, 2, and 3, there was no significant effect on trust: F(2, 14)=1.20, p=0.16. When a one-tailed, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare transactive memory systems (TMS) at Times 1, 2, and 3 was conducted, there was no significant effect on TMS: F(2, 15)=1.33, p=0.15. We conducted a one-tailed, one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare team psychological safety at Times 1, 2, and 3, and there was no significant effect on team psychological safety: F(2,15)=1.53, p=0.12. There was a significant difference in communication between rounds with and without telemedicine [t(25)=-1.76, p<0.05], such that there was more task-based communication during telerounds. Telemedicine increased task-based communication and did not negatively impact team trust, psychological safety, or TMS during rounds.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Telemedicine may offer advantages for some teamwork competencies without sacrificing the efficacy of others and may be adopted by intact rounding teams without hindering teamwork.",3
954,Patch-based adaptive weighting with segmentation and scale (PAWSS) for visual tracking in surgical video,"Vision-based tracking in an important component for building computer assisted interventions in minimally invasive surgery as it facilitates estimation of motion for instruments and anatomical targets. Tracking-by-detection algorithms are widely used for visual tracking, where the problem is treated as a classification task and a tracking target appearance model is updated over time using online learning. In challenging conditions, like surgical scenes, where tracking targets deform and vary in scale, the update step is prone to include background information in model appearance or to lack the ability to estimate change of scale, which degrades the performance of classifier. In this paper, we propose a Patch-based Adaptive Weighting with Segmentation and Scale (PAWSS) tracking framework that tackles both scale and background problems. A simple but effective colour-based segmentation model is used to suppress background information and multi-scale samples are extracted to enrich the training pool, which allows the tracker to handle both incremental and abrupt scale variations between frames. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on Online Tracking Benchmark (OTB) dataset and Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenge datasets, showing that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art trackers, and it especially improves successful rate score on OTB dataset, while on VOT datasets, PAWSS ranks among the top trackers while operating at real-time frame rates. Focusing on the application of PAWSS to surgical scenes, we evaluate on MICCAI 2015 challenge instrument tracking challenge and in vivo datasets, showing that our approach performs the best among all submitted methods and also has promising performance on in vivo surgical instrument tracking.",1
955,Human Factors Evaluation of Surgeons' Working Positions for Gynecologic Minimal Access Surgery,"Study objective:
        
      
      To investigate work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) in gynaecological minimal access surgery (MAS), including bariatric (plus size) patients DESIGN: Mixed methods (Canadian Task Force classification III).
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Teaching hospital in the United Kingdom.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Survey, observations (anthropometry, postural analysis), and interviews.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) were present in 63% of the survey respondents (n = 67). The pilot study (n = 11) identified contributory factors, including workplace layout, equipment design, and preference of port use (relative to patient size). Statistically significant differences for WRMSD-related posture risks were found within groups (average-size mannequin and plus-size mannequin) but not between patient size groups, suggesting that port preference may be driven by surgeon preference (and experience) rather than by patient size.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Some of the challenges identified in this project need new engineering solutions to allow flexibility to support surgeon choice of operating approach (open, laparoscopic or robotic) with a workplace that supports adaptation to the task, the surgeon, and the patient.",3
956,Novel Strategies for Managing Retropharyngeal Lymph Node Metastases in Head and Neck and Thyroid Cancer with Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS),"Retropharyngeal metastases are encountered in a variety of head and neck malignancies, imposing significant surgical challenges owing to their distinct location and proximity to neurovascular structures. Radiotherapy is the recommended treatment in most cases owing to its oncological efficacy. However, retropharyngeal irradiation affects the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscles and parotid glands, with the potential for long-term dysphagia and xerostomia. A younger oropharyngeal and thyroid cancer patient demographic is trending, fueling interest in treatment de-escalation strategies. Consequently, reducing radiotoxicity and its long-term effects is of special relevance in modern head and neck oncology practice. Through its unique ability to safely extirpate these traditionally difficult-to-access retropharyngeal lymph nodes via a natural orifice, TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) can considerably lower the surgical morbidity of retropharyngeal lymph node dissection (RPLND), compared with current existing approaches. This review summarizes the latest developments in the field, exposing current research gaps and discusses specific clinical settings where TORS could enable treatment de-escalation. In early-stage node-negative oropharyngeal cancer, single-modality surgical treatment with TORS RPLND may improve risk stratification of metastasis and recurrence in this region. TORS RPLND is also a potentially viable treatment option in salvage of an isolated retropharyngeal node recurrence or in the primary setting of a thyroid malignancy with a single positive retropharyngeal node. In time, TORS RPLND may provide an alternative de-escalation strategy in these three scenarios. However, with the reported morbidities, further prospective trials with long-term follow-up data are required to prove oncological safety and functional benefits over existing strategies.",1
957,How can the presence of a surgical care practitioner improve training for staff who are learning how to scrub for robotics cases in a urology theatre?,"Aim:
        
      
      This study examines how a surgical care practitioner can contribute to the learning needs of junior scrub staff learning to scrub for urological robotics cases. Key themes include education, technical training, non-technical skills, patient safety and the specialist practitioner as educator.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data collection was via an online survey, distributed by a gatekeeper to 13 participants. These were junior scrub practitioners who had completed their robotic rotation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A 62% response rate was achieved. The majority of respondents indicated that there was a difference in interactions when a surgical care practitioner was assisting compared to a surgical trainee. Half of the respondents felt more confident when the surgical care practitioner was assisting.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A range of approaches were proposed for how the surgical care practitioner could enhance learning. Structured input is likely to be more appropriate to avoid the surgical care practitioner being distracted from their own duties whilst assisting. There is scope for further research.",3
958,Comparative Effectiveness in Perioperative Outcomes of Robotic versus Open Radical Cystectomy: Results from a Multicenter Contemporary Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background:
        
      
      The comparative effectiveness of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) versus open radical cystectomy (ORC) in terms of perioperative outcomes is still a matter of debate affecting payors, physicians, and patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate comparative perioperative and longer-term morbidity of RARC versus ORC in a multicenter contemporary retrospective cohort of patients.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This retrospective multicenter study included patients with bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy at 10 academic centers between 2000 and 2017.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Intraoperative outcomes including blood loss and operative time as well as postoperative outcomes including time to discharge, complication, readmission, reoperation, and mortality rates at 30 and 90 d were assessed. Multiple imputation and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used. IPTW-multivariable-adjusted regression and logistic analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of RARC versus ORC with perioperative outcomes at 30 and 90 d.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Overall, 1887 patients (1197 RARC and 690 ORC) were included in the study. After IPTW-adjusted analysis, no differences between the groups in terms of preoperative characteristics were observed. RARC was associated with lower blood loss (p<0.001), shorter length of stay (p<0.001), and longer operative time (p=0.007). On IPTW-adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses, no differences in terms of 30- and 90-d complications, reoperation, and mortality rates were observed. RARC was independently associated with a higher readmission rate at both 30 and 90 d. Limitations are mainly related to the retrospective nature of the study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      While RARC was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stay, it also led to longer operation times and more readmissions. There were no differences in 30- and 90-d complications. Because there are no apparent differences in safety between ORC and RARC in expert centers, differences in oncologic and cost-effectiveness outcomes are likely to drive decision making regarding RARC utilization.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In this study we investigated the differences between RARC and ORC in terms of perioperative outcomes. We found no difference in early and late complications. We concluded that, to date, differences in oncologic and cost-effectiveness outcomes should drive decision making regarding RARC utilization.",2
959,Robotic Arch Catheter Placement Reduces Cerebral Embolization During Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR),"Objective:
        
      
      Stroke caused by cerebral embolization constitutes a principal risk during arch manipulation and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). This study investigates the incidence of cerebral embolization during catheter placement in the aortic arch, and compares robotic and manual techniques.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Intra-operative transcranial Doppler (TCD) was performed in 11 patients undergoing TEVAR. Wire and catheter placement in the arch was performed by two experienced operators. Manual and robotic catheter placement and removal were compared for each patient; 44 manoeuvres were studied in total. A conventional 5Fr pigtail catheter was used for manual cannulation via a 5Fr access sheath. The 6Fr/9Fr co-axial Magellan endovascular robotic system was used for robotic navigation operated from a remote workstation. The number of high intensity transient signals (HITS) detected by TCD during different stages of TEVAR was recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median procedural embolization rate was 173 (interquartile range 97-240). There were significantly fewer HITS detected during robotic catheter placement with six in total (median 0, IQR 0-1), compared with 38 HITS (median 2, IQR 1-5) during manual catheter placement (p = .018). There were no HITS detected during robotic catheter removal by auto-retraction as per manufacturer instructions. On two occasions, however, when the robotic catheter system was removed manually without correcting for articulation, it resulted in one HIT in one case and 11 HITS in the second case.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic catheter placement is feasible during TEVAR, and results in significantly less cerebral embolization compared with manual techniques. The active manoeuvrability, control, and stability of the robotic system is likely to reduce contact with an atheromatous aortic arch wall, and thereby reduce dislodgement of particulate matter and result in less embolization. The importance of adhering to manufacturer instructions during use and removal of the robotic catheter is also highlighted.",7
960,"Real-world comparison of curative open, laparoscopic and robotic resections for sigmoid and rectal cancer-single center experience","There has been an increase in the utilization of robotic surgery in addition to traditional open or laparoscopic approaches. Aim of this study is to compare the short-term outcomes for open, laparoscopic, and robotic surgery for rectal and sigmoid cancer. One hundred and forty-seven patients (open n = 48, laparoscopic n = 49, robotic n = 50) undergoing curative resections by two surgeons between 2013 and 2020 were included. Data analyzed included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, length of stay, post-operative outcomes, and pathologic surrogates of oncologic results, including total mesorectal excision (TME) quality, circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement and lymph node (LN) yield. Median age of population was 68 years (IQR 59-73), majority (68%) were males. Median distance from anal verge in the robotic surgery group was 8 cm, compared to 15 and 14.5 cm in the open and laparoscopic groups, respectively, p = 0.029, (laparoscopic vs robotic, p = 0.005 and open vs robotic, p = 0.027). Proportion of patients who received neoadjuvant radiotherapy in robotic surgery group was higher, p = 0.04. In sub-group of tumors between 3 and 7 cm from anal verge more patients in the robotic surgery group had sphincter preservation, p = 0.006. Length of stay, maximum C-reactive protein, and white blood cell rise favored minimally invasive approaches compared to open surgery. There were no differences in post-operative complications, lymph node yield or CRM positivity rate between the three groups. Robotic surgery approach is safe and allows sphincter preservation without compromising TME quality in rectal cancer surgery.",9
961,New Trends in Robotic Retroperitoneal Partial Nephrectomy,"Robotic technology and new surgical adjuncts are continually evolving to aid the operating surgeon and improve patient outcomes. Retroperitoneal access in renal surgery has clear benefits over traditional transperitoneal surgery with robotics augmenting the surgeon’s ability to operate in this anatomically confined space. Traditionally, the retroperitoneal approach was reserved for patients with posterior or laterally located tumors, or in patients with hostile abdomens; however, more streamlined surgical robots, improvements in port placement and increased utilization of the retroperitoneal approach has meant that the vast majority of small renal masses can be safely accessed via the retroperitoneum. This chapter aims to explore this paradigm shift further, while also exploring the use of added technologies and variations in surgical techniques.",1
962,Ethical governance is essential to building trust in robotics and artificial intelligence systems,"This paper explores the question of ethical governance for robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. We outline a roadmap-which links a number of elements, including ethics, standards, regulation, responsible research and innovation, and public engagement-as a framework to guide ethical governance in robotics and AI. We argue that ethical governance is essential to building public trust in robotics and AI, and conclude by proposing five pillars of good ethical governance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.",4
963,A retrospective review of a large series of groin hernia patients operated with robotically assisted laparoscopic technique (R-TAPP),"We have reviewed the patient outcome and the feasibility of robotically assisted inguinal hernia repair (R-TAPP) from the first 4-years period after its introduction in our department in a Scandinavian Public Health hospital. A total of 226 hernia repairs were performed in 195 patients (31 bilateral hernias). 160 patients had primary hernias, whereas 35 had recurrent hernias. Of the recurrent hernias, three had recurred twice. The majority of the hernias were in the right groin (53.3%) and the lateral location was the most common (65.0%). The hernia was scrotal in 29 cases. The mean operation time was significantly reduced throughout the observation period for our cohort, i.e. from 81 to 57 min (p < 0.001). The operation time was 27 min faster (mean value) in unilateral vs bilateral hernias and 19 min faster (mean value) in primary vs residual hernias. There were no statistically significant differences in operation time between lateral and medial hernias, and no differences in operation time between the obese and normal-weight cases. We experienced four severe per-operative complications (4/226; 1.8%): two cases of abdominal wall bleeding subsequently undergoing intravascular coiling, one perforation of the urinary bladder and one perforation of small bowel that were both closed by direct suture intraoperatively. There were no conversions to laparoscopy or open procedure. One hernia recurred during the observation period. Our findings suggest that the R-TAPP procedure in a Scandinavian Public Health hospital's surgical department is both safe and feasible.",3

965,Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation Versus Robotic-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy for the Treatment of Small Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Introduction:
        
      
      The authors compared the oncologic outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RPN) for the treatment of T1 stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This was a retrospective data analysis of a high-volume single tertiary centre. Patients were treated with RFA or RPN following multidisciplinary decision making. Only histologically proven RCCs were included. Baseline demographics were collected, and PADUA scores of tumour features were calculated to standardize baseline anatomy. Peri-operative complications, kidney function and oncological outcomes were compared.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-three cases were included in each group. Baseline renal function was poorer in RFA, and 16/63 RFA patients had tumours in single kidneys compared to 1/63 RPN cases (p < 0.001). Length of stay was shorter in RFA (1 vs. 3 days, p < 0.0001). Post-procedure renal function decline at 30 days was significantly less in RFA [(-0.8) ± 9.6 vs. (-16.1) ± 19.5 mls/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.0001]. More minor complications were recorded in RPN (10/63 vs. 4/63, p = 0.15), but local recurrence was numerically higher in RFA (6/63 vs. 1/63, p = 0.11). Disease-free survival (DFS) was not significantly different (adjusted HR = 0.6, 95 % Cl 0.1-3.7; p = 0.60). Increasing tumour size was an independent predictor of local recurrence (adjusted HR = 1.7; 95 % Cl 1.1-2.6 per cm; p = 0.02).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both RPN and RFA offer very good oncological outcomes for the treatment of T1 RCC with low peri-operative morbidity and similar oncologic outcomes. RFA demonstrated fewer peri-operative complications and better preservation of renal function, whereas RPN had an insignificantly lower local recurrence rate. RFA should be offered alongside RPN for selected cases.",1
966,Handheld Active Add-On Control Unit for a Cable-Driven Flexible Endoscope,"The instruments currently used by surgeons for in utero treatment of the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) are rigid or semi-rigid. Their poor dexterity makes this surgical intervention risky and the surgeon's work very complex. This paper proposes the design, assembly and quantitative evaluation of an add-on system intended to be placed on a commercialized cable-driven flexible endoscope. The add-on system is lightweight and easily exchangeable thanks to the McKibben muscle actuators embedded in its system. The combination of the flexible endoscope and the new add-on unit results in an easy controllable flexible instrument with great potential use in TTTS treatment, and especially for regions that are hard to reach with conventional instruments. The fetoscope has a precision of 7.4% over its entire bending range and allows to decrease the maximum planar force on the body wall of 6.15% compared to the original endoscope. The add-on control system also allows a more stable and precise actuation of the endoscope flexible tip.",1
967,Ethical Considerations from Child-Robot Interactions in Under-Resourced Communities,"Recent advancements in socially assistive robotics (SAR) have shown a significant potential of using social robotics to achieve increasing cognitive and affective outcomes in education. However, the deployments of SAR technologies also bring ethical challenges in tandem, to the fore, especially in under-resourced contexts. While previous research has highlighted various ethical challenges that arise in SAR deployment in real-world settings, most of the research has been centered in resource-rich contexts, mainly in developed countries in the 'Global North,' and the work specifically in the educational setting is limited. This research aims to evaluate and reflect upon the potential ethical and pedagogical challenges of deploying a social robot in an under-resourced context. We base our findings on a 5-week in-the-wild user study conducted with 12 kindergarten students at an under-resourced community school in New Delhi, India. We used interaction analysis with the context of learning, education, and ethics to analyze the user study through video recordings. Our findings highlighted four primary ethical considerations that should be taken into account while deploying social robotics technologies in educational settings; (1) language and accent as barriers in pedagogy, (2) effect of malfunctioning, (un)intended harms, (3) trust and deception, and (4) ecological viability of innovation. Overall, our paper argues for assessing the ethical and pedagogical constraints and bridging the gap between non-existent literature from such a context to evaluate better the potential use of such technologies in under-resourced contexts.",4
968,Motion-adapted catheter navigation with real-time instantiation and improved visualisation,"The improvements to catheter manipulation by the use of robot-assisted catheter navigation for endovascular procedures include increased precision, stability of motion and operator comfort. However, navigation through the vasculature under fluoroscopic guidance is still challenging, mostly due to physiological motion and when tortuous vessels are involved. In this paper, we propose a motion-adaptive catheter navigation scheme based on shape modelling to compensate for these dynamic effects, permitting predictive and dynamic navigations. This allows for timed manipulations synchronised with the vascular motion. The technical contribution of the paper includes the following two aspects. Firstly, a dynamic shape modelling and real-time instantiation scheme based on sparse data obtained intra-operatively is proposed for improved visualisation of the 3D vasculature during endovascular intervention. Secondly, a reconstructed frontal view from the catheter tip using the derived dynamic model is used as an interventional aid to user guidance. To demonstrate the practical value of the proposed framework, a simulated aortic branch cannulation procedure is used with detailed user validation to demonstrate the improvement in navigation quality and efficiency.",0
969,Human-robot mutual adaptation in collaborative tasks: Models and experiments,"Adaptation is critical for effective team collaboration. This paper introduces a computational formalism for mutual adaptation between a robot and a human in collaborative tasks. We propose the Bounded-Memory Adaptation Model, which is a probabilistic finite-state controller that captures human adaptive behaviors under a bounded-memory assumption. We integrate the Bounded-Memory Adaptation Model into a probabilistic decision process, enabling the robot to guide adaptable participants towards a better way of completing the task. Human subject experiments suggest that the proposed formalism improves the effectiveness of human-robot teams in collaborative tasks, when compared with one-way adaptations of the robot to the human, while maintaining the human's trust in the robot.",4
970,From a Disposable Ureteroscope to an Active Lightweight Fetoscope-Characterization and Usability Evaluation,"The twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a severe fetal anomaly appearing in up to 15% of identical twin pregnancies. This anomaly occurs when twins share blood vessels from a common placenta. The complication leads to an unbalanced blood transfusion between both fetuses. A current surgical treatment consists in coagulating the shared vessels using a fetoscope with an embedded laser. Such treatment is very delicate and constraining due to limited vision and size of the insertion area. The rigidity and lack of controllability of the current used instruments add an additional difficulty and limit the choice in insertion site. This letter proposes an improved flexible fetoscope, offering an enhanced laser controllability and higher versatility regarding the location of the insertion site. A better approach angle can therefore be realized. Also, tissue damage may be further reduced. This single-handed controllable active fetoscope is obtained after adaptation of a LithoVue (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), a commercially available passive flexible ureteroscope. The LithoVue is fitted with a unique lightweight add-on actuation module foreseen of an artificial muscle and a dedicated control system. Experiments in a mixed reality trainer suggested that the proposed fetoscope is compact, ergonomic, and intuitive in use, allowing an adequate control of the flexible end.",1
971,System Transparency in Shared Autonomy: A Mini Review,"What does transparency mean in a shared autonomy framework? Different ways of understanding system transparency in human-robot interaction can be found in the state of the art. In one of the most common interpretations of the term, transparency is the observability and predictability of the system behavior, the understanding of what the system is doing, why, and what it will do next. Since the main methods to improve this kind of transparency are based on interface design and training, transparency is usually considered a property of such interfaces, while natural language explanations are a popular way to achieve transparent interfaces. Mechanical transparency is the robot capacity to follow human movements without human-perceptible resistive forces. Transparency improves system performance, helping reduce human errors, and builds trust in the system. One of the principles of user-centered design is to keep the user aware of the state of the system: a transparent design is a user-centered design. This article presents a review of the definitions and methods to improve transparency for applications with different interaction requirements and autonomy degrees, in order to clarify the role of transparency in shared autonomy, as well as to identify research gaps and potential future developments.",4
972,Laparoscopic vs robotic nephroureterectomy: Is it time to re-establish the standard? Evidence from a systematic review,"Objective:
        
      
      To conduct a systematic review of comparative studies of laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LNU), the standard management for upper urothelial tumours, and robot-assisted NU (RANU) that has emerged as a viable alternative.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all studies reporting on both LNU and RANU for upper urothelial tract tumours.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In all, 1630 patients were included, of which 838 underwent LNU and 792 RANU. Three studies reported on mean operative time and found it to be less in LNU, with two reporting this to be significant (RANU 298 vs LNU 251 min, P = 0.03; 306 vs 234 min, respectively, P < 0.001). Both studies reporting on median node count found this to be higher in the robotic groups: RANU 5.5 vs LNU 1.0 and RANU 21 vs LNU 11. Positive surgical margins (RANU 1.69% vs LNU 7.06%, P = 0.18), bladder recurrence (24.6% vs 36.89%, P = 0.09), and distant metastases (27.50% vs 17.50%, P = 0.29) were not significantly different between the two techniques. Disease-specific mortality did not differ between the two techniques (RANU 7.5% vs LNU 12.5%, P = 0.46), but postoperative mortality was reduced in RANU (0.14% vs 1.32%, P = 0.03). Overall complication rates were statistically lower in RANU, at 12.5% vs 18.8% (P < 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review suggests these techniques are equivalent in terms of perioperative and oncological performance. Furthermore, there may be a lower overall complication rate, as well as postoperative mortality in the robotic group. Further research in the form of a randomised controlled trial is warranted.",2
973,A prospective non-randomised single-center study comparing laparoscopic and robotic distal pancreatectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) is increasing in popularity thanks to the benefits that have been recently demonstrated by many authors. The Da Vinci(®) Surgical System could overcome some limits of laparoscopy, helping the surgeons to perform safer and faster difficult procedures. Nowadays, prospective clinical trials comparing LDP to robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) are lacking. The aim of this study is to present a prospective comparison between the two techniques.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Since November 2011, all patients suitable for minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy were assigned either to LDP or RDP, depending on the availability of the Da Vinci(®) Surgical System for our Surgical Unit. Demographics, clinical, and intra- and postoperative data, including estimated costs of the procedure, were prospectively collected. Follow-up included cross-sectional imaging ended on April 2014.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-two patients underwent RDP and 21 LDP; patients' characteristics were similar. The median operative time was longer and procedures' cost was double in RDP group. The conversion to open rate and the median length of postoperative hospital stay were 4.5 % and 7 days, respectively, in both groups. Pancreatic fistula developed in 57.1 % (12/21) and 50 % (11/22) of LDP and RDP, respectively (p = 0.870), being grade A the most frequent. Mortality was nil and an R0 resection was achieved in all Patients. The overall number of lymph nodes harvested was similar between the two groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Both RDP and LDP are valid techniques for the treatment of distal pancreatic tumors. The advantages of RDP are claimed by many but still under investigation. Some of these advantages are more subjective than objective, and it seems difficult to demonstrate a real superiority of one technique over the other in a standardized fashion. In our experience, laparoscopy has not been abandoned in favor of the robot: we continue to perform both approaches choosing upon single patient's characteristics.",3
974,Uptake and outcomes of robotic gynaecological surgery in England (2006-2018): an account of Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES),"This was a retrospective study to review the uptake and outcomes of robotic gynaecological surgery in England between 1st April 2006 and 31st March 2018, analysing Hospital Episode Statistics form National Health Service hospitals in England. Women aged 18 years and above who had elective gynaecological surgery were included and those who had undergone robotic gynaecology surgery were included. Robotic gynaecological procedures were defined as procedures that used a robotic minimal access approach for hysterectomy, adnexal surgery and urogynaecological surgery (sacrocolpopexy, sacrohysteropexy and colposuspension). Numbers of procedures were reviewed by year and mapped to the 44 NHS healthcare regions. Length of stay (nights in hospital), laparotomy (conversion during primary procedure or after return to theatre for management of complication), and 30-day emergency readmission rates were calculated by year and procedure type. Overall 527,217 elective gynaecological procedures were performed in the English NHS (1st April 2006 and 31st March 2018), of which 4384 (0.83%) were performed with robotic assistance (3864 (88%) hysterectomy, 706 (16%) adnexal surgery, 192 (4%) urogynaecological surgery). There was gradual rise in the uptake of robotic surgery but there was a marked geographical variation. Median (IQR) length of stay (LOS) was 1(1-2) night, laparotomy rate was 0.3% and 30-day emergency readmission rate was 4.7%. LOS was statistically, but not clinically, different across time. Other outcomes did not differ by year. Robotic gynaecological procedures are increasingly being used in the English NHS, predominantly for hysterectomy, although in small proportions (2.6% in the most recent study year). There was wide geographical variation in robotic uptake across England and overall, outcomes were comparable to those reported in other countries.",3

Cells were successfully transferred between different sites representative of research and manufacturing settings; and passaged manually and using the CompacT SelecT automation platform. Modified protocols were developed for the automated system and the management of cells aggregates (clumps) was identified as the critical step. Cellular morphology, pluripotency gene expression and differentiation into the three germ layers have been used compare the outcomes of manual and automated processes.",4
976,Concurrent use of a robotic uterine manipulator and a robotic laparoscope holder to achieve assistant-less solo laparoscopy: the double ViKY,Three patients requiring gynecological surgery had uterine manipulation using a VCare(®) controlled by a ViKY(®) at the same time as having a ViKY(®) robotic arm controlling the laparoscope. The setup time for each varied from 6-9 min for the uterine manipulator and 3-5 min for the laparoscope holder. In all cases (one endometriosis and two dermoid cysts) the operative field was good. Two patients were discharged within 24 h of surgery. One patient required an extra day in hospital after she went into acute urinary retention once the catheter was removed. This work demonstrated that assistant-less solo gynecological surgery is feasible using two ViKY robotic arms for both uterine manipulation and laparoscope holding.,6
977,Surgical trainee experience and opinion of robotic surgery in surgical training and vision for the future: a snapshot study of pan-specialty surgical trainees,"Background:
        
      
       Robotic surgery is well established across multiple surgical specialities in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI). We aimed to elucidate current surgical trainee experience of and attitudes to robotic surgery in a surgical training programme across the UK and ROI to determine the future role of robotic surgery in international surgical training programmes. Methods: A pan-specialty trainee cross-sectional study was performed on behalf of the Association of Surgeons in Training (ASiT) using mixed-methodology. Round 1: a digital questionnaire was disseminated to all ASiT members. Round 2: 'live-polling' was performed prior to and following the Robotic Surgery plenary session convened at the ASiT 2020 International Conference (Birmingham). Data analysis was performed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.
    


          Results:
        
      
       Three hundred and four responses were analysed (n = 244 digital questionnaire, n = 60 live-polling). Overall, 73.8% (n = 180) of trainees would value greater access to robotic surgery training. 73.4% (n = 179) believed that robotic surgery was important for the future of their desired specialty and 77.2% (n = 156) believed it should be incorporated into formal surgical training. Qualitative analysis identified that trainees believe that robotic training should have a formal role in surgical training. Perceived disadvantages of robotic surgery experience in surgical training included expense and the current impact of consultant robotic learning curves on training.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
       Current surgical trainees desire greater access to robotic surgery in surgical training. Robotic surgery is developing an increasing role in current surgical practice and it is important that it is introduced in a timely, evidence-based fashion to surgical trainees at an appropriate stage of training.",3
978,Comparison of robotic and manual persistent AF ablation using catheter contact force sensing: an international multicenter registry study,"Background:
        
      
      Catheter-based contact force sensing (CFS) technology gives detailed information regarding contact between the catheter tip and myocardium. This may result in more effective ablation procedures. The primary objective of this study was comparison of remote robotic navigation (RRN) and Manual CFS ablation. The secondary objective was to compare CFS with non-CFS ablation for both navigation modes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Prospective registries of consecutive cases undergoing their first ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) from six hospitals in the United Kingdom and South Africa were analyzed: 50 Manual/CFS and 50 RRN/CFS cases were included. Historical control non-CFS ablation patients were matched by propensity score, giving a total 200 patient cohort.
    


          Results:
        
      
      RRN/CFS was associated with improved single procedure 1-year success rates (64% vs 36%, P = 0.01) and shorter fluoroscopy times (41% reduction, P < 0.0005) than Manual/CFS ablation, without any difference in procedure times (P = 0.8). The mean contact force was higher in RRN/CFS than Manual/CFS cases (16 [15-18 g] vs 13 [12-15 g], respectively, P = 0.003). Compared with non-CFS historical controls, CFS cases had higher 1-year success rates for RRN (64% vs 36%, P = 0.01), but not Manual ablation (36% vs 38%, P = 1). Procedure times were reduced for CFS cases (20%, P < 0.005 both navigation modes), as were fluoroscopy times (Manual: 43%, RRN 83%, P < 0.005 for both). There were no differences in rates of major or minor complications for either comparison (P > 0.5).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A combination of RRN and CFS is associated with improved success rates at 1 year and fluoroscopy times for persistent AF ablation, compared with Manual ablation and non-CFS RRN ablation.",0
979,Non-randomised comparison of acute and long-term outcomes of robotic versus manual ventricular tachycardia ablation in a single centre ischemic cohort,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotically guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation offers greater catheter stability that may improve lesion depth. We performed a non-randomised comparison of patients undergoing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation either manually or robotically using the Hansen Sensei system for recurrent implantable defibrillator (ICD) therapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with infarct-related scar underwent VT ablation using the Hansen system to assess feasibility compared with patients undergoing manual VT ablation during a similar time period. Power delivery during robotic ablation was restricted to 30 W at 60 s. VT inducibility was checked at the end of the procedure. Pre-ablation ICD therapy burdens over 6 months were compared with post-ablation therapy averaged to a 6-month period.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twelve consecutive patients who underwent robotic VT ablation were compared to 12 consecutive patients undergoing a manual ablation. Patient demographics and comorbidities were similar in the two groups. A higher proportion of robotic cases were urgent (9/12 (75%)) vs. manual (4/12 (33%)) (p = 0.1). Post-ablation VT stimulation did not induce clinical VT in 11/12 (92%) in each group. There were no peri-procedural complications related to ablation delivery. Patients were followed up for approximately 2 years. Averaged over 6 months, robotic ICD therapy burdens fell from 32 (5-400) events to 2.5 (0-11) (p = 0.015). Therapy burden fell from 14 (10-25) to 1 (0-5) (p = 0.023) in the manual group. There was no difference in long-term outcome (p = 0.60) and mortality (4/12 (33%), p = 1.0).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotically guided VT ablation is both feasible and safe when compared to manual ablation with good acute and long-term outcomes.",8
980,Results of the first interim analysis of the RAPPER II trial in patients with spinal cord injury: ambulation and functional exercise programs in the REX powered walking aid,"Background:
        
      
      The RAPPER II study investigates the feasibility, safety and acceptability of using the REX self-stabilising robotic exoskeleton in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who are obligatory wheelchair users. Feasibility is assessed by the completion of transfer into the REX device, competency in achieving autonomous control and completion of upper body exercise in an upright position in the REX device. Safety is measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Device acceptability is assessed with a user questionnaire.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      RAPPER II is a prospective, multi-centre, open label, non-randomised, non-comparative cohort study in people with SCI recruited from neurological rehabilitation centres in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. This is the planned interim report of the first 20 participants. Each completed a transfer into the REX, were trained to achieve machine control and completed Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests as well as upper body exercises in standing in a single first time session. The time to achieve each task as well as the amount of assistance required was recorded. After finishing the trial tasks a User Experience questionnaire, exploring device acceptability, was completed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All participants could transfer into the REX. The mean transfer time was 439 s. Nineteen completed the exercise regime. Eighteen could achieve autonomous control of the REX, 17 of whom needed either no assistance or the help of just one therapist. Eighteen participants completed at least one TUG test in a mean time of 313 s, 15 with the assistance of just one therapist. The questionnaire demonstrated high levels of acceptability amongst users. There were no Serious Adverse Events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This first interim analysis of RAPPER II shows that it is feasible and safe for people with SCI to use the REX powered assisted walking device to ambulate and exercise in. Participants with tetraplegia and paraplegia could walk and perform a functional exercise program when standing needing only modest levels of assistance in most cases. User acceptability was high.

981,Transmural migration of azygous vein Hem-O-lok clip causing food bolus 3 months following uneventful minimally invasive oesophagectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Hem-o-lok clips are widely deployed in various laparoscopic and robotic operations. Their migration is not very common and majority of reported cases are limited to biliary, prostatic and vesico-urethral cases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Herein, we would like to report the first case of transmural migration of Hem-o-lok clip from azygous vein stump following totally minimally invasive two-stage oesophagectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the distal oesophagus, into the gastric conduit 3-months following uneventful discharge. The patient presented with 5-days history of worsening dysphagia.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The subsequent gastroscopy revealed normal gastric conduit with two Hem-o-lok clips containing the azygous vein stump within its lumen at the level of the oesophago-gastric anastomosis, propagating a food bolus obstruction. The foreign body was successfully removed and the patient was discharged the same day without any complications at 5 months follow up.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Hem-o-lok clip migration trends to be a well-established event. However, their mechanism and exact incidence remains elusive to this date. To the best of our knowledge, their migration in oesophageal cancer surgery has not been reported.",0
982,Management of parapharyngeal space cavernous sinus haemangioma using transoral robotic surgery,"Cavernous haemangiomas are a very rare occurrence in the parapharyngeal space (PPS). Here, we present a case of a 58-year-old woman with an incidentally identified left PPS mass thought to be a pleomorphic adenoma that underwent excision by transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Intraoperative findings demonstrated no solid mass present and histological assessment of resected tissue confirmed a cavernous haemangioma. We discuss our experience in the management of a radiological and surgical mismatch of a PPS mass in what we believe to be the first cavernous haemangioma to be excised by TORS in this region.",1
983,Robotic lateral oropharyngectomy following diagnostic tonsillectomy is oncologically safe in patients with high risk human papillomavirus related squamous cell cancer,"Purpose:
        
      
      Diagnostic tonsillectomy is rarely an oncologic operation owing to close or positive margins. The standard of care is for further treatment to the primary site, typically with adjuvant radiotherapy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      14 patients with close or positive margins following a diagnostic tonsillectomy underwent transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and lateral oropharyngectomy; five patients with the longest follow-up had their excision specimens examined with a step serial sectioning technique (SSS).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Conventional histopathological examination of the TORS resection specimens did not demonstrate residual carcinoma in 13 patients, confirmed by examination using SSS in 5 patients. There were no post-operative complications or long-term functional deficit. Seven patients received surgery alone with 100% overall and disease specific survival, respectively (median follow-up 27.5 months; range 5.2-50.4).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This prospective study suggests that TORS lateral oropharyngectomy alone is an oncologically safe treatment when close or positive margins are identified on diagnostic tonsillectomy in HPV-positive SCC.",1
984,Cognition-based variable admittance control for active compliance in flexible manipulation of heavy objects with a power-assist robotic system,"In the first step, a 1-DOF power-assist robotic system (PARS) is developed for lifting lightweight objects. Dynamics for human-robot co-manipulation of objects is derived that considers human cognition (weight perception). Then, admittance control with position feedback and velocity controller is derived using weight perception-based dynamics. Human subjects lift an object with the PARS, and HRI (human-robot interaction) and system characteristics are analyzed. A comprehensive scheme is developed to evaluate the HRI and performance. HRI is expressed in terms of physical HRI (maneuverability, motion, safety, stability, naturalness) and cognitive HRI (workload, trust), and performance is expressed in terms of manipulation efficiency and precision. To follow the guidance of ISO/TS 15066, hazard analysis and risk assessment are conducted. A constrained optimization algorithm is proposed to determine the values of the control parameters that produce optimum HRI and performance with lowest risk. Results show that consideration of weight perception in dynamics and control helps achieve optimum HRI and performance for a set of hard constraints. In the second step, a weight perception-based novel variable admittance control scheme is proposed as an active compliance to the system, which enhances the physical HRI, trust, precision and efficiency by 53.05%, 46.78%, 3.84% and 4.98%, respectively, and reduces workload by 35.38% and thus helps achieve optimum HRI and performance for a set of soft constraints. The risk reduces due to the active compliance. Then, effectiveness of the optimization and control algorithms is validated using a multi-DOF PARS for manipulating heavy objects, and intuitive and natural HRI and performance for power-assisted heavy object manipulation are achieved through calibrating HRI and performance with that for manipulation of lightweight object.",4
985,A novel gaze-controlled flexible robotized endoscope; preliminary trial and report,"Background:
        
      
      Interventional endoluminal therapy is rapidly advancing as a minimally invasive surgical technique. The expanding remit of endoscopic therapy necessitates precision control. Eye tracking is an emerging technology which allows intuitive control of devices. This was a feasibility study to establish if a novel eye gaze-controlled endoscopic system could be used to intuitively control an endoscope.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An eye gaze-control system consisting of eye tracking glasses, specialist cameras and a joystick was used to control a robotically driven endoscope allowing steering, advancement, withdrawal and retroflexion. Eight experienced and eight non-endoscopists used both the eye gaze system and a conventional endoscope to identify ten targets in two simulated environments: a sphere and an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) model. Completion of tasks was timed. Subjective feedback was collected from each participant on task load (NASA Task Load Index) and acceptance of technology (Van der Laan scale).
    


          Results:
        
      
      When using gaze-control endoscopy, non-endoscopists were significantly quicker when using gaze-control rather than conventional endoscopy (sphere task 3:54 ± 1:17 vs. 9:05 ± 5:40 min, p = 0.012, and UGI model task 1:59 ± 0:24 vs 3:45 ± 0:53 min, p < .001). Non-endoscopists reported significantly higher NASA-TLX workload total scores using conventional endoscopy versus gaze-control (80.6 ± 11.3 vs 22.5 ± 13.8, p < .001). Endoscopists reported significantly higher total NASA-TLX workload scores using gaze control versus conventional endoscopy (54.2 ± 16 vs 26.9 ± 15.3, p = 0.012). All subjects reported that the gaze-control had positive 'usefulness' and 'satisfaction' score of 0.56 ± 0.83 and 1.43 ± 0.51 respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The novel eye gaze-control system was significantly quicker to use and subjectively lower in workload when used by non-endoscopists. Further work is needed to see if this would translate into a shallower learning curve to proficiency versus conventional endoscopy. The eye gaze-control system appears feasible as an intuitive endoscope control system. Hybrid gaze and hand control may prove a beneficial technology to evolving endoscopic platforms.",0
986,Trust in and Ethical Design of Carebots: The Case for Ethics of Care,"The paper has two main objectives: to examine the challenges arising from the use of carebots as well as to discuss how the design of carebots can deal with these challenges. First, it notes that the use of carebots to take care of the physical and mental health of the elderly, children and the disabled as well as to serve as assistive tools and social companions encounter a few main challenges. They relate to the extent of the care robots' ability to care for humans, potential deception by robot morphology and communications, (over)reliance on or attachment to robots, and the risks of carebot use without informed consent and potential infringements of privacy. Secondly, these challenges impinge upon issues of ethics and trust which are somewhat overlapping in terms of concept and practice. The existing ethical guidelines, standards and regulations are general in nature and lack a central ethical framework and concrete principles applicable to the care contexts. Hence, to deal with these important challenges, it is proposed in the third part of the paper that carebots be designed by taking account of Ethics of Care as the central ethical framework. It argues that the Ethics of Care offer the following advantages: (a) it provides sufficiently concrete principles and embodies values that are sensitive and applicable to the design of carebots and the contexts of caring practices; (b) it coheres with the tenets of Principlism and select ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics); and (c) it is closely associated with the preservation and maintenance of trust.",4
987,An Immersive Investment Game to Study Human-Robot Trust,"As robots become more advanced and capable, developing trust is an important factor of human-robot interaction and cooperation. However, as multiple environmental and social factors can influence trust, it is important to develop more elaborate scenarios and methods to measure human-robot trust. A widely used measurement of trust in social science is the investment game. In this study, we propose a scaled-up, immersive, science fiction Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenario for intrinsic motivation on human-robot collaboration, built upon the investment game and aimed at adapting the investment game for human-robot trust. For this purpose, we utilize two Neuro-Inspired COmpanion (NICO) - robots and a projected scenery. We investigate the applicability of our space mission experiment design to measure trust and the impact of non-verbal communication. We observe a correlation of 0.43 ( p = 0.02  ) between self-assessed trust and trust measured from the game, and a positive impact of non-verbal communication on trust ( p = 0.0008  ) and robot perception for anthropomorphism ( p = 0.007  ) and animacy ( p = 0.00002  ). We conclude that our scenario is an appropriate method to measure trust in human-robot interaction and also to study how non-verbal communication influences a human's trust in robots.",4
988,"Mutual Shaping in Swarm Robotics: User Studies in Fire and Rescue, Storage Organization, and Bridge Inspection","Many real-world applications have been suggested in the swarm robotics literature. However, there is a general lack of understanding of what needs to be done for robot swarms to be useful and trusted by users in reality. This paper aims to investigate user perception of robot swarms in the workplace, and inform design principles for the deployment of future swarms in real-world applications. Three qualitative studies with a total of 37 participants were done across three sectors: fire and rescue, storage organization, and bridge inspection. Each study examined the users' perceptions using focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we describe our findings regarding: the current processes and tools used in these professions and their main challenges; attitudes toward robot swarms assisting them; and the requirements that would encourage them to use robot swarms. We found that there was a generally positive reaction to robot swarms for information gathering and automation of simple processes. Furthermore, a human in the loop is preferred when it comes to decision making. Recommendations to increase trust and acceptance are related to transparency, accountability, safety, reliability, ease of maintenance, and ease of use. Finally, we found that mutual shaping, a methodology to create a bidirectional relationship between users and technology developers to incorporate societal choices in all stages of research and development, is a valid approach to increase knowledge and acceptance of swarm robotics. This paper contributes to the creation of such a culture of mutual shaping between researchers and users, toward increasing the chances of a successful deployment of robot swarms in the physical realm.",4
989,Intrinsic somatosensory feedback supports motor control and learning to operate artificial body parts,"Objective.Considerable resources are being invested to enhance the control and usability of artificial limbs through the delivery of unnatural forms of somatosensory feedback. Here, we investigated whether intrinsic somatosensory information from the body part(s) remotely controlling an artificial limb can be leveraged by the motor system to support control and skill learning.Approach.We used local anaesthetic to attenuate somatosensory inputs to the big toes while participants learned to operate through pressure sensors a toe-controlled and hand-worn robotic extra finger. Motor learning outcomes were compared against a control group who received sham anaesthetic and quantified in three different task scenarios: while operating in isolation from, in synchronous coordination, and collaboration with, the biological fingers.Main results.Both groups were able to learn to operate the robotic extra finger, presumably due to abundance of visual feedback and other relevant sensory cues. Importantly, the availability of displaced somatosensory cues from the distal bodily controllers facilitated the acquisition of isolated robotic finger movements, the retention and transfer of synchronous hand-robot coordination skills, and performance under cognitive load. Motor performance was not impaired by toes anaesthesia when tasks involved close collaboration with the biological fingers, indicating that the motor system can close the sensory feedback gap by dynamically integrating task-intrinsic somatosensory signals from multiple, and even distal, body-parts.Significance.Together, our findings demonstrate that there are multiple natural avenues to provide intrinsic surrogate somatosensory information to support motor control of an artificial body part, beyond artificial stimulation.",4
990,Neurophysiology of robot-mediated training and therapy: a perspective for future use in clinical populations,"The recovery of functional movements following injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is multifaceted and is accompanied by processes occurring in the injured and non-injured hemispheres of the brain or above/below a spinal cord lesion. The changes in the CNS are the consequence of functional and structural processes collectively termed neuroplasticity and these may occur spontaneously and/or be induced by movement practice. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such brain plasticity may take different forms in different types of injury, for example stroke vs. spinal cord injury (SCI). Recovery of movement can be enhanced by intensive, repetitive, variable, and rewarding motor practice. To this end, robots that enable or facilitate repetitive movements have been developed to assist recovery and rehabilitation. Here, we suggest that some elements of robot-mediated training such as assistance and perturbation may have the potential to enhance neuroplasticity. Together the elemental components for developing integrated robot-mediated training protocols may form part of a neurorehabilitation framework alongside those methods already employed by therapists. Robots could thus open up a wider choice of options for delivering movement rehabilitation grounded on the principles underpinning neuroplasticity in the human CNS.",4
991,Human Factors Considerations and Metrics in Shared Space Human-Robot Collaboration: A Systematic Review,"The degree of successful human-robot collaboration is dependent on the joint consideration of robot factors (RF) and human factors (HF). Depending on the state of the operator, a change in a robot factor, such as the behavior or level of autonomy, can be perceived differently and affect how the operator chooses to interact with and utilize the robot. This interaction can affect system performance and safety in dynamic ways. The theory of human factors in human-automation interaction has long been studied; however, the formal investigation of these HFs in shared space human-robot collaboration (HRC) and the potential interactive effects between covariate HFs (HF-HF) and HF-RF in shared space collaborative robotics requires additional investigation. Furthermore, methodological applications to measure or manipulate these factors can provide insights into contextual effects and potential for improved measurement techniques. As such, a systematic literature review was performed to evaluate the most frequently addressed operator HF states in shared space HRC, the methods used to quantify these states, and the implications of the states on HRC. The three most frequently measured states are: trust, cognitive workload, and anxiety, with subjective questionnaires universally the most common method to quantify operator states, excluding fatigue where electromyography is more common. Furthermore, the majority of included studies evaluate the effect of manipulating RFs on HFs, but few explain the effect of the HFs on system attributes or performance. For those that provided this information, HFs have been shown to impact system efficiency and response time, collaborative performance and quality of work, and operator utilization strategy.",4
992,Analysis of a Customized Clutch Joint Designed for the Safety Management of an Ultrasound Robot,"Robotic systems have great potential to assist ultrasound (US) examination. Currently, the safety management method to limit the force that a US robot can apply mostly relies on force sensing and software-based algorithms. This causes the concern that the potential failure of sensors, electrical systems, or software could lead to patient injuries. In this paper, we investigated a customized spring-loaded ball clutch joint designed for a newly developed US robot to passively limit the force applied. The working mechanism of the clutch was modelled and the kinematic-based analysis was performed to understand the variation of the limited force at different postures of the robot. The triggering torque of the clutch was found to be 3928 N·mm, which results in the mean limited force 22.10 ± 1.76 N at the US probe end based on potential postures. The real measurement of the implemented design indicated that the limited force could be set between 17 and 24 N at the neutral posture depending on the preload. With the maximum preload, the mean limited force was found to be 21.98 ± 0.96 N based on 30 repeated measurements. The practically measured results meet the expectation from the theoretical calculation, and the resulting small variation has indicated a good repeatability of the clutch. Based on this evidence, it is concluded that the proposed clutch meets the design aim that it can limit the force applied within a safe range while at the same time ensuring that the required force is applied at different postures.",0
993,An analysis of design recommendations for socially assistive robot helpers for effective human-robot interactions in senior care,"As the global population ages, there is an increase in demand for assistive technologies that can alleviate the stresses on healthcare systems. The growing field of socially assistive robotics (SARs) offers unique solutions that are interactive, engaging, and adaptable to different users' needs. Crucial to having positive human-robot interaction (HRI) experiences in senior care settings is the overall design of the robot, considering the unique challenges and opportunities that come with novice users. This paper presents a novel study that explores the effect of SAR design on HRI in senior care through a results-oriented analysis of the literature. We provide key design recommendations to ensure inclusion for a diverse set of users. Open challenges of considering user preferences during design, creating adaptive behaviors, and developing intelligent autonomy are discussed in detail. SAR features of appearance and interaction mode along with SAR frameworks for perception and intelligence are explored to evaluate individual developments using metrics such as trust, acceptance, and intent to use. Drawing from a diverse set of features, SAR frameworks, and HRI studies, the discussion highlights robot characteristics of greatest influence in promoting wellbeing and aging-in-place of older adults and generates design recommendations that are important for future development.",4
994,Is the use of ultra-low insufflation pressure safe and feasible in robot assisted radical prostatectomy,"Objective:
        
      
      Current innovations in minimally invasive surgery include using ultra-low insufflation pressure with the aim of improving peri-operative and short-term clinical outcomes. Despite an exponential increase in the use of robotic technology, there remains limited literature supporting the use of ultra-low pressure during robotic surgery. We performed a feasibility study of ultra-low-pressure robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP).
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Prospective data related to standard pressure (15 mm Hg) RARP (Group 1) and ultra-low-pressure (6 mm Hg) RARP (Group 2) were collected and compared to assess the peri-operative and short-term outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Outcome data of 112 consecutive patients (56 in each group) were collected. Mean age, pre-operative prostate specific antigen, body mass index, and performance status were similar in both groups. Mean console time was shorter in ultra-low-pressure RARP group (125 minutes) than in standard pressure RARP group (138 minutes) (p=0.016). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in console time or estimated blood loss between these 2 groups for patients with RARP and lymph node dissection. No patients from either group required conversion to an open procedure or received a peri-operative blood transfusion. None of the patients in either group developed post-operative complications or needed readmission.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our study has demonstrated that ultra-low-pressure RARP is a practical and safe option, and it supports the routine practice of ultra-low-pressure RARP with slow adaptation in other complex robotic surgeries, such as robotic cystectomy for bladder cancer.",2
995,Extracervical Approaches to Thyroid Surgery: Evolution and Review,"Over the last two decades, advances and adaptation of technology have led to a variety of endoscopic thyroidectomy procedures being performed. The drive for extracervical procedures has been predominantly influenced by the desire for improved cosmesis via avoidance of visible scars. Extracervical techniques have shown considerable evolution with approaches that have included transaxillary, breast, postauricular, and transoral routes. There has been a varied evidence base for each of these approaches with regard to technical feasibility, safety, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. In recent years, robotic-assisted thyroid surgery has gained increased popularity worldwide with the introduction of the da Vinci Robot. Reports of improved postoperative outcomes and patient satisfaction have been in contrast to the financial burden, longer operative time, and increased training required which, to date, have limited widespread application. The aim of this review is to describe the evolution of extracervical procedures including surgical approaches, outcomes, advantages, and disadvantages. Consideration is also given to the future direction of extracervical thyroid surgery with regard to the safety, feasibility, and application of robotic systems.",1
996,Emergency robotic colorectal surgery during COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective case series study,"Objective:
        
      
      While interest in elective robotic surgery is growing, use in emergency setting remains limited due to challenges posed by sicker patients, advanced pathology and logistical issues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, robotic surgery could provide the benefit of having the surgeon away from the bedside and reducing the number of directly exposed medical staff. The objective of this study was to report patient outcomes and initial learning experience of emergency robotic colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A case series study was conducted, including patients undergoing emergency robotic colorectal surgery between February 2020 and February 2021 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, UK. Patient data were collected from an ethics approved prospective database. Patient demographics, operative time, conversions and postoperative complications were recorded. In addition, readmissions, length of stay and short-term oncological outcomes were analyzed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten patients with median age 64 y (range, 36-83 y) were included. Four patients had robotic complete mesocolic resection for obstructing cancers. Six had colorectal resections for benign disease in emergency setting. All were R0 with a mean lymph node harvest of 54 ± 13. Mean operative time was 249 ± 117 min, the median length of stay was 9.4 d (range, 5-22 d). Only one patient was given a temporary diverting ileostomy. There were no grade III/V complications and no 30-day mortality.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Provided an experienced team and peri-operative planning, emergency robotic colorectal surgery can achieve favorable outcomes with benefits of radical lymph node dissection in oncological cases and avoidance of diverting stoma.",3
997,Factors affecting catheter contact in the human left atrium and their impact on ablation efficacy,"Introduction:
        
      
      Preclinical work suggests factors including catheter orientation and contact consistency during individual radiofrequency ablations influence lesion size. Our aim was to investigate factors affecting catheter contact in the left atrium (LA) and their effects on ablation.
    


          Methods and results:
        
      
      A total of 2,298 8-second static LA mapping points were studied in 30 patients undergoing ablation for AF (16 in AF, 14 sinus rhythm [SR], 18 remote robotic navigation [RRN] procedures) using a contact force (CF) sensing catheter. CF variability (CFV: difference between 20 Hz-sampled CF waveform mean peak and trough) increased with mean CF, Spearman's ρ = 0.6, P < 0.005. Catheter drift correlated weakly with CF (Pearson's correlation -0.06, P = 0.005). CFV was higher in SR than AF and with RRN (P < 0.001). In AF, there was less catheter drift for RRN than manual navigation points but the converse was true in SR. In 747 static 30 second LA ablations, the influence of contact parameters on ablation efficacy was compared by multivariate analysis of impedance drop during ablation: a lesser drop suggesting reduced efficacy. For a given force time integral (FTI), increased CFV (>5 g) and locational drift (>3.5 mm), perpendicular contact, SR and RRN usage were associated with a lesser impedance drop with ablation (P < 0.005 for each), suggesting reduced efficacy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Beyond the FTI, the quality of catheter contact influences ablation efficacy, and clinical catheter contact is affected by multiple factors, including the atrial rhythm and catheter navigation mode. Maximal efficacy is provided by parallel contact with CFV ≤5 g, catheter drift ≤3.5 mm, and manual navigation.",7
998,Feasibility of school-based computer-assisted robotic gaming technology for upper limb rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy,"Introduction:
        
      
      We investigated the feasibility of using computer-assisted arm rehabilitation (CAAR) computer games in schools. Outcomes were children's preference for single player or dual player mode, and changes in arm activity and kinematics.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Nine boys and two girls with cerebral palsy (6-12 years, mean 9 years) played assistive technology computer games in single-user mode or with school friends in an AB-BA design. Preference was determined by recording the time spent playing each mode and by qualitative feedback. We used the ABILHAND-kids and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure to evaluate activity limitation, and a portable laptop-based device to capture arm kinematics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No difference was recorded between single-user and dual-user modes (median daily use 9.27 versus 11.2 min, p = 0.214). Children reported dual-user mode was preferable. There were no changes in activity limitation (ABILHAND-kids, p = 0.424; COPM, p = 0.484) but we found significant improvements in hand speed (p = 0.028), smoothness (p = 0.005) and accuracy (p = 0.007).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      School timetables prohibit extensive use of rehabilitation technology but there is potential for its short-term use to supplement a rehabilitation program. The restricted access to the rehabilitation games was sufficient to improve arm kinematics but not arm activity. Implications for Rehabilitation School premises and teaching staff present no obstacles to the installation of rehabilitation gaming technology. Twelve minutes per day is the average amount of time that the school time table permits children to use rehabilitation gaming equipment (without disruption to academic attendance). The use of rehabilitation gaming technology for an average of 12 minutes daily does not appear to benefit children's functional performance, but there are improvements in the kinematics of children's upper limb.",6
999,Novel robotic technology for the rapid intraoperative manufacture of patient-specific instrumentation allowing for improved glenoid component accuracy in shoulder arthroplasty: a cadaveric study,"Background:
        
      
      Accurate prosthesis placement in arthroplasty is an important factor in the long-term success of these interventions. Many types of guidance technology have been described to date often suffering from high costs, complex theater integration, time inefficiency, and problems with day-to-day usability. We present a novel, intraoperative robotics platform, capable of rapid, real-time manufacture of low-cost patient-specific guides while overcoming many of the issues with existing approaches.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prototype robotics platform was assessed in a 24-specimen cadaveric trial during sequential simulated shoulder arthroplasty procedures. The platform consisted of a tableside robot with sterile drapes and sterile disposable components. The robot itself comprised a 3D optical scanner, a 3-axis sterile robotic drill, and a 2-axis receptacle into which the disposable consumables were inserted. The consumable was composed of a region of rapidly setting moldable material and a clip allowing it to be reversibly attached to the robot. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging was obtained for all cadaveric specimens, and a surgical plan was created focusing on glenoid component position-specifically, guidewire position to allow for accurate glenoid preparation before implant insertion. Intraoperatively, for every specimen, the relevant osseous anatomy was exposed and humeral and glenoid preparation undertaken in the usual manner. The sterile disposable was used to create a mold of the joint surface. Once set, the mold was inserted into the robot and an optical scan of the surface was undertaken followed by automatic surface registration with the CT data and surgical plan. An automatic guide hole was subsequently drilled into the molded blank, which was removed from the robot and placed back into the patient, with the melded surface ensuring exact replacement. The guidewire was then driven through the guide hole in accordance with the preoperative plan.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The novel robotic platform achieved average angular accuracies of 1.9° (standard deviation [SD] 1.3) version and 1.2° (SD 0.7) inclination with positional accuracy of 1.1 mm (SD 0.7) compared to a preoperative plan.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      We have described a novel robotics platform that is able to reliably produce patient-specific intraoperative guides to allow for accurate guidewire placement. Guidance is provided using a portable intraoperative device. The results suggest achieved accuracy levels may be equivalent to those seen in other existing guidance technologies; however, eventual in vivo trials and analysis is required. This technology has potential transferability to improve accuracy in other areas of arthroplasty.",0
1000,3D straight-stick laparoscopy versus 3D robotics for task performance in novice surgeons: a randomised crossover trial,"Background:
        
      
      The advent of three-dimensional passive stereoscopic imaging has led to the development of 3D laparoscopy. In simulation tasks, a reduction in error rate and performance time is seen with 3D compared to two-dimensional (2D) laparoscopy with both novice and expert surgeons. Robotics utilises 3D and instrument articulation through a console interface. Robotic trials have demonstrated that tasks performed in 3D produced fewer errors and quicker performance times compared with those in 2D. It was therefore perceived that the main advantage of robotic surgery was in fact 3D. Our aim was to compare 3D straight-stick laparoscopic task performance (3D) with robotic 3D (Robot), to determine whether robotic surgery confers additional benefit over and above 3D visualisation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We randomised 20 novice surgeons to perform four validated surgical tasks, either with straight-stick 3D laparoscopy followed by 3D robotic surgery or in the reverse order. The trial was conducted in two fully functional operating theatres. The primary outcome of the study was the error rate as defined for each task, and the secondary outcome was the time taken to complete each task. The participants were asked to perform the tasks as quickly and as accurately as possible. Data were analysed using SPSS version 21.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median error rate for completion of all four tasks with the robot was 2.75 and 5.25 for 3D with a P value <0.001. The median performance time for completion of all four tasks with the robot was 157.1 and 342.5 s for 3D with a P value <0.001.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study has shown that for novice surgeons, there is a significant benefit in a simulated setting of 3D robotic systems over 3D straight-stick laparoscopy, in terms of reduced error rate and quicker task performance time.",6
1001,Change in quality of life in older people with dementia participating in Paro-activity: a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Aim:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to investigate effects of robot-assisted group activity with Paro on quality of life in older people with dementia.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Nursing home residents with severe dementia often experience social withdrawal and lower quality of life, which are suggested to be enhanced by non-pharmacological interventions.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A cluster-randomized controlled trial. Ten nursing home units were randomized to robot-assisted intervention or control group (treatment as usual).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were collected between March 2013-September 2014. 27 participants participated in group activity for 30 minutes twice a week over 12 weeks, 26 participated in the control group. Change in quality of life was assessed by local nurses through the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia scale at baseline, after end of intervention and at 3 months follow-up. The scale and regular psychotropic medication were analysed stratified by dementia severity. Analysis using mixed model, one-way anova and linear regression were performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      An effect was found among participants with severe dementia from baseline to follow-up showing stable quality of life in the intervention group compared with a decrease in the control group. The intervention explained most of the variance in change in the total scale and in the subscales describing Tension and Well-being for the group with severe dementia. The intervention group used significantly less psychotropic medication compared with the control group after end of intervention.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Pleasant and engaging activities facilitated by nursing staff, such as group activity with Paro, could improve quality of life in people with severe dementia. The trial is in adherence with the CONSORT statement and is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (study ID number: NCT01998490) [corrected].",2
1002,Prostatic hydroablation (Aquablation): A new effective ultrasound guided robotic waterjet ablative surgery for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia,"Introduction:
        
      
      Bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are increasingly common amongst ageing men leading to poor quality of life. Surgical treatment options targeted at the obstructing prostate are often required to relief the bladder outlet obstruction, following failure or discontinuation of medical therapies. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the mainstay and gold standard for benign prostate surgery for last few decades. Currently with technological advancements, numerous minimally invasive surgical therapies have been employed to provide effective symptom relief while minimalizing morbidities and preserving sexual function. Prostatic hydroablation (Aquablation) is a new technique which involves high velocity water jets used in non-thermal ablation of the obstructing prostatic tissue robotically delivered by a transurethral cystoscopic handpiece and guided by real time transrectal ultrasound imaging. Recent trials have shown that aquablation is safe and effective in the treatment of symptomatic BPH while maintaining sexual preservation.
    


          Method:
        
      
      Aquablation using the Aquabeam system (PROCEPT BioRobotics, Redwood Shores, CA, USA) combines the precision of autonomous robotic execution in delivering high velocity waterjets via a cystoscopic handpiece with accurate anatomical prostatic mapping using real time transrectal ultrasound imaging. The initial part of the surgery involves careful treatment planning tailored to the prostatic anatomy with preservation of important landmarks nearby, then, high velocity waterjet streams are delivered to ablate the obstructing prostatic tissue without use of any heat. Following the ablation and removal of handpiece, a routine cystoscopic bladder washout is performed and haemostasis achieved with balloon tamponade from a 3 way catheter placed under tension empolying a custom designed catheter tensioning device.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Initial studies involving a few case series and a phase II trial demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of aquablation in treatment of symptomatic BPH. Subsequently, a large multicentre international prospective randomised blinded clinical trial (WATER) was conducted to assess the efficacy of aquablation versus TURP. Results from this pivotal trial showed non-inferior symptom relief compared to transurethral prostate resection but with a lower risk of sexual dysfunction. WATER II study was then conducted to assess the safety and feasibility from a multicentre prospective study of aquablation in the treatment of symptomatic large-volume BPH. The results from this study showed that aquablation is feasible and safe in treating men with men with large prostates (80-150 mL).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The current landscape of BPH surgical treatment should be individualized with a shared decision- making process based on prostatic anatomy and clinical parameters combined with patient's preferences to select the ideal treatment option for each patient. Aquablation is one such option that involves a robotically delivered hydroablation technique based on individualised real time ultrasonic prostatic mapping that can offer safe and effective treatment for symptomatic BPH while minimising sexual dysfunction. Larger trials with longer follow up data will be required to further validate the long term effectiveness of aquablation.",0
1003,Salient Feature of Haptic-Based Guidance of People in Low Visibility Environments Using Hard Reins,"This paper presents salient features of human-human interaction where one person with limited auditory and visual perception of the environment (a follower) is guided by an agent with full perceptual capabilities (a guider) via a hard rein along a given path. We investigate several salient features of the interaction between the guider and follower such as: 1) the order of an autoregressive (AR) control policy that maps states of the follower to actions of the guider; 2) how the guider may modulate the pulling force in response to the trust level of the follower; and 3) how learning may successively apportion the responsibility of control across different muscles of the guider. Based on experimental systems identification on human demonstrations from ten pairs of naive subjects, we show that guiders tend to adopt a third-order AR predictive control policy and followers tend to adopt second-order reactive control policy. Moreover, the extracted guider's control policy was implemented and validated by human-robot interaction experiments. By modeling the follower's dynamics with a time varying virtual damped inertial system, we found that it is the coefficient of virtual damping which is most sensitive to the trust level of the follower. We used these experimental insights to derive a novel controller that integrates an optimal order control policy with a push/pull force modulator in response to the trust level of the follower monitored using a time varying virtual damped inertial model.",0
1004,"Endoscopic placement of pancreatic stent for ""Deep"" pancreatic enucleations operative technique and preliminary experience at two high-volume centers","Background:
        
      
      Pancreatic enucleation (PE) is a viable option for the removal of non-malignant pancreatic masses leading to complete preservation of organ function. Nevertheless, PE is associated with substantial rates of post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF), particularly when the mass is close to the main pancreatic duct (MPD). Preoperative stenting of the MPD may prevent its injury when performing PE. This paper describes a novel technique of ""deep"" PE preceded by endoscopic stenting of the MPD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      From January 2017 to May 2019, patients with small pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors proximal to the MPD were candidates for PE with previous stenting of the MPD at the University of Verona, Italy, and at the UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California. The endoscopic stenting was scheduled either the day before or 3 weeks before surgery, depending on the participating institute.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten patients were included in this pilot study. The endoscopic procedure was successful and well tolerated in all cases. Open, laparoscopic and robotic PE were performed. Seven patients had surgical complications. Among these, six developed a post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF), but neither grade C fistulas nor disruptions of the MPD were detected. At pathology, a low grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor was confirmed in all cases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In the setting of high-volume centers, this procedure is safe, and it is associated with acceptable short-term surgical morbidity. The preoperative stenting of the MPD might extend the surgical indications for PE.",1
1005,Limited liver resections in the posterosuperior segments: international multicentre propensity score-matched and coarsened exact-matched analysis comparing the laparoscopic and robotic approaches,"Background:
        
      
      Limited liver resections (LLRs) for tumours located in the posterosuperior segments of the liver are technically demanding procedures. This study compared outcomes of robotic (R) and laparoscopic (L) LLR for tumours located in the posterosuperior liver segments (IV, VII, and VIII).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an international multicentre retrospective analysis of patients who underwent R-LLR or L-LLR at 24 centres between 2010 and 2019. Patient demographics, perioperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were analysed; 1 : 3 propensity score matching (PSM) and 1 : 1 coarsened exact matching (CEM) were performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 1566 patients undergoing R-LLR and L-LLR, 983 met the study inclusion criteria. Before matching, 159 R-LLRs and 824 L-LLRs were included. After 1 : 3 PSM of 127 R-LLRs and 381 L-LLRs, comparison of perioperative outcomes showed that median blood loss (100 (i.q.r. 40-200) versus 200 (100-500) ml; P = 0.003), blood loss of at least 500 ml (9 (7.4 per cent) versus 94 (27.6 per cent); P < 0.001), intraoperative blood transfusion rate (4 (3.1 per cent) versus 38 (10.0 per cent); P = 0.025), rate of conversion to open surgery (1 (0.8 per cent) versus 30 (7.9 per cent); P = 0.022), median duration of Pringle manoeuvre when applied (30 (20-46) versus 40 (25-58) min; P = 0.012), and median duration of operation (175 (130-255) versus 224 (155-300); P < 0.001) were lower in the R-LLR group compared with the L-LLR group. After 1 : 1 CEM of 104 R-LLRs with 104 L-LLRs, R-LLR was similarly associated with significantly reduced blood loss and a lower rate of conversion to open surgery.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Based on a matched analysis of well selected patients, both robotic and laparoscopic access could be undertaken safely with good outcomes for tumours in the posterosuperior liver segments.",9
1006,Robot-assisted Versus Open Radical Cystectomy in Patients Receiving Perioperative Chemotherapy for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer: The Oncologist's Perspective from a Multicentre Study,"Background:
        
      
      Little is known about the outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC) combined with perioperative chemotherapy for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate surgical and oncological outcomes for RARC and ORC in multimodal treatment.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Data from 28 centres were collected for cystectomies performed between January 2000 and July 2013.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      RARC or ORC combined with perioperative chemotherapy for UBC.
    


          Outcome measures and statistical analysis:
        
      
      Fisher's exact tests, χ2 tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the RARC and ORC groups. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential prognostic factors.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      A total of 688 patients (n=603 ORC and n=85 RARC) were analysed; 60.6% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 45.1% adjuvant chemotherapy. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between the groups. The median time from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy was 1.9 mo for both RARC and ORC groups. The median number of lymph nodes removed was 21 (interquartile range [IQR] 14-35) for RARC and 13 (IQR 8-21) for ORC (p<0.001); the results were confirmed in subgroup analyses. Multivariable analyses revealed no difference in the rate of positive surgical margins (p=0.54 and p=0.78), rate of neobladder diversion (p=0.33 and p=0.51), relapse-free survival (p=0.31 and p=0.23), and overall survival (p=0.63 and p=0.69). The retrospective nature of the data is the major limitation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this study, no differences in efficacy outcomes or ability to deliver adjuvant chemotherapy were observed between RARC and ORC. The increasing use of RARC is justifiable from an oncological viewpoint.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      In a retrospective study of patients who received perioperative chemotherapy for urothelial bladder cancer, we found no difference in key outcomes between robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and open radical cystectomy. Performing RARC seems to be justifiable in the multidisciplinary setting.",2
1007,A Continuum Robot and Control Interface for Surgical Assist in Fetoscopic Interventions,"Twin-twin transfusion syndrome requires interventional treatment using a fetoscopically introduced laser to sever the shared blood supply between the fetuses. This is a delicate procedure relying on small instrumentation with limited articulation to guide the laser tip and a narrow field of view to visualize all relevant vascular connections. In this letter, we report on a mechatronic design for a comanipulated instrument that combines concentric tube actuation to a larger manipulator constrained by a remote centre of motion. A stereoscopic camera is mounted at the distal tip and used for imaging. Our mechanism provides enhanced dexterity and stability of the imaging device. We demonstrate that the imaging system can be used for computing geometry and enhancing the view at the operating site. Results using electromagnetic sensors for verification and comparison to visual odometry from the distal sensor show that our system is promising and can be developed further for multiple clinical needs in fetoscopic procedures.",0
1008,Transfer of open and laparoscopic skills to robotic surgery: a systematic review,"Due to its advantages over open surgery and conventional laparoscopy, uptake of robot-assisted surgery has rapidly increased. It is important to know whether the existing open or laparoscopic skills of robotic novices shorten the robotic surgery learning curve, potentially reducing the amount of training required. This systematic review aims to assess psychomotor skill transfer to the robot in clinical and simulated settings. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases were systematically searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from inception to August 2021 alongside website searching and citation chaining. Article screening, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Outcomes included simulator performance metrics or in the case of clinical studies, peri- and post-operative metrics. Twenty-nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All studies were judged to be at high or moderate overall risk of bias. Results were narratively synthesised due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures. Two of the three studies assessing open surgical skill transfer found evidence of successful skill transfer while nine of twenty-seven studies evaluating laparoscopic skill transfer found no evidence. Skill transfer from both modalities is most apparent when advanced robotic tasks are performed in the initial phase of the learning curve but quality and methodological limitations of the existing literature prevent definitive conclusions. The impact of incorporating laparoscopic simulation into robotic training curricula and on the cost effectiveness of training should be investigated.",3
1009,Trust in the Danger Zone: Individual Differences in Confidence in Robot Threat Assessments,"Effective human-robot teaming (HRT) increasingly requires humans to work with intelligent, autonomous machines. However, novel features of intelligent autonomous systems such as social agency and incomprehensibility may influence the human's trust in the machine. The human operator's mental model for machine functioning is critical for trust. People may consider an intelligent machine partner as either an advanced tool or as a human-like teammate. This article reports a study that explored the role of individual differences in the mental model in a simulated environment. Multiple dispositional factors that may influence the dominant mental model were assessed. These included the Robot Threat Assessment (RoTA), which measures the person's propensity to apply tool and teammate models in security contexts. Participants (N = 118) were paired with an intelligent robot tasked with making threat assessments in an urban setting. A transparency manipulation was used to influence the dominant mental model. For half of the participants, threat assessment was described as physics-based (e.g., weapons sensed by sensors); the remainder received transparency information that described psychological cues (e.g., facial expression). We expected that the physics-based transparency messages would guide the participant toward treating the robot as an advanced machine (advanced tool mental model activation), while psychological messaging would encourage perceptions of the robot as acting like a human partner (teammate mental model). We also manipulated situational danger cues present in the simulated environment. Participants rated their trust in the robot's decision as well as threat and anxiety, for each of 24 urban scenes. They also completed the RoTA and additional individual-difference measures. Findings showed that trust assessments reflected the degree of congruence between the robot's decision and situational danger cues, consistent with participants acting as Bayesian decision makers. Several scales, including the RoTA, were more predictive of trust when the robot was making psychology-based decisions, implying that trust reflected individual differences in the mental model of the robot as a teammate. These findings suggest scope for designing training that uncovers and mitigates the individual's biases toward intelligent machines.",4

1011,Development and Testing of Psychological Conflict Resolution Strategies for Assertive Robots to Resolve Human-Robot Goal Conflict,"As service robots become increasingly autonomous and follow their own task-related goals, human-robot conflicts seem inevitable, especially in shared spaces. Goal conflicts can arise from simple trajectory planning to complex task prioritization. For successful human-robot goal-conflict resolution, humans and robots need to negotiate their goals and priorities. For this, the robot might be equipped with effective conflict resolution strategies to be assertive and effective but similarly accepted by the user. In this paper, conflict resolution strategies for service robots (public cleaning robot, home assistant robot) are developed by transferring psychological concepts (e.g., negotiation, cooperation) to HRI. Altogether, fifteen strategies were grouped by the expected affective outcome (positive, neutral, negative). In two online experiments, the acceptability of and compliance with these conflict resolution strategies were tested with humanoid and mechanic robots in two application contexts (public: n 1 = 61; private: n 2 = 93). To obtain a comparative value, the strategies were also applied by a human. As additional outcomes trust, fear, arousal, and valence, as well as perceived politeness of the agent were assessed. The positive/neutral strategies were found to be more acceptable and effective than negative strategies. Some negative strategies (i.e., threat, command) even led to reactance and fear. Some strategies were only positively evaluated and effective for certain agents (human or robot) or only acceptable in one of the two application contexts (i.e., approach, empathy). Influences on strategy acceptance and compliance in the public context could be found: acceptance was predicted by politeness and trust. Compliance was predicted by interpersonal power. Taken together, psychological conflict resolution strategies can be applied in HRI to enhance robot task effectiveness. If applied robot-specifically and context-sensitively they are accepted by the user. The contribution of this paper is twofold: conflict resolution strategies based on Human Factors and Social Psychology are introduced and empirically evaluated in two online studies for two application contexts. Influencing factors and requirements for the acceptance and effectiveness of robot assertiveness are discussed.",4
1012,Using smartphone-delivered stereoscopic vision in microsurgery: a feasibility study,"Background:
        
      
      Many surgical specialties are increasingly looking towards robot-assisted surgeries to improve patient outcome. Surgeons conducting robot-assisted operations require real-time surgical view. Ophthalmic robots can lead to novel vitreoretinal treatments, such as cannulating retinal vessels or even gene delivery to targeted retinal cells. This study investigates the feasibility of smartphone-delivered stereoscopic vision for microsurgical use.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A stereo-camera, connected to a laptop, was used to capture the 3D view from a binocular surgical microscope. Wi-Fi connection was used to live-stream the laptop display onto the smartphone screen wirelessly. Finally, a Virtual Reality (VR) headset, which acts as a stereoscope, was used to house the smartphone. The headset wearer then fused these images to achieve stereoscopic perception.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Using smartphone-delivered 3D vision, the author performed a simulated cataract extraction operation successfully, despite a time lag of 0.354 s ± 0.038. To the author's knowledge, this is the first simulated ophthalmic operation performed via smartphone-delivered stereoscopic vision.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Microscopic output in 3D with minimal time lag can be readily achievable with smartphones and VR headsets. Uncoupling the surgeon from the operating microscope is required to achieve tele-presence, an essential step in tele-robotics. Where operating theatre space is a concern, head-mounted displays may be more convenient than 3D televisions. This 3D live-casting technique can be used in teaching and mentoring settings, where microsurgeries can be live-streamed stereoscopically onto smartphones via local Wi-Fi network. When connected to the internet, microsurgeries can be broadcasted live and viewers worldwide can see the surgeon's view wearing their VR headsets.",1
1013,How Ethical Issues Raised by Human-Robot Interaction can Impact the Intention to use the Robot?,"The goal of this research is to focus on the ethical issues linked to the interaction between humans and robots in a service delivery context. Through this user study, we want to see how ethics influence user's intention to use a robot in a frontline service context. We want to observe the importance of each ethical attribute on user's intention to use the robot in the future. To achieve this goal, we incorporated a video that showed Pepper, the robot, in action. Then respondents had to answer questions about their perception of robots based on the video. Based on a final sample of 341 respondents, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our hypotheses. The results show that the most important ethical issue is the Replacement and its implications for labor. When we look at the impact of the ethical issues on the intention to use, we discovered that the variables impacting the most are Social cues, Trust and Safety.",4
1014,Evaluation of a robot-assisted video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery programme,"At present, there is increasing interest in surgical procedures using a robot-assisted device. The aim of this study was to investigate whether robot-assisted video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was more effective than conventional VATS. A total of 64 VATS lobectomies in Papworth Hospital (Cambridge, UK) were included in the study. In 34 cases the lobectomies were performed using conventional VATS (CV group), while in the remaining 30 cases the lobectomies were performed using robot-assisted VATS (Robotic group). In the robot-assisted VATS, FreeHand®, a thoracoscopic camera controller produced by Freehand 2010 Ltd. (Eastleigh, UK), was used. The duration of the thoracoscopic surgery in the Robotic group was 145.50±10.43 min, whereas in the CV group the duration was 162.79±9.40 min. The surgery duration in the Robotic group was 10.62% shorter than that in the CV group (P<0.05). The rates of bleeding, pulmonary infection, arrhythmia and prolonged air leak (≥5 days) in the Robotic group were 0, 3.33, 26.67 and 13.33%, respectively, while the corresponding rates in the CV group were 2.94, 5.88, 20.59 and 17.65%, respectively. No significant differences were identified in the postoperative complication rates between the two groups (P≥0.05). There was no perioperative mortality in the study. Compared with conventional VATS, FreeHand-assisted VATS provides a similar rate of postoperative complications and a reduced surgery duration, and may be beneficial for the recovery of the patients following VATS.",1
1015,Extended Interviews with Stroke Patients Over a Long-Term Rehabilitation Using Human-Robot or Human-Computer Interactions,"Socially assistive robots (SARs) have been proposed to assist post-stroke patients in performing their exercise during their rehabilitation process, with the trust in the robot identified as an important factor in human-robot interaction. In the current study, we aimed to identify and characterize factors that influence post-stroke patients' trust in a robot-operated and a computer-operated rehabilitation platform during and after a long-term experience with the platform. We conducted 29 interviews with 16 stroke patients who underwent a long-term rehabilitation process, assisted by either a SAR or a computer interface. The intervention lasted 5-7 weeks per patient, for a total of 229 sessions over 18 months. By using a qualitative research method-extended interviews ""in the wild"" with stroke patients, over a long-term rehabilitation process-our study reveals users' perspectives regarding factors affecting trust in the SAR or in the computer interface during their rehabilitation process. The results support the assertion that SARs have an added value in the rehabilitative care of stroke patients; It appears that personal characteristics, such as age and gender, have an effect on the users' acceptance of a non-human operator as a practice assistant. Our findings support the notion that SARs augment rehabilitative therapies beyond a standard computer; Importantly, patients appreciated different aspects of the non-human operator in the two groups: In the SAR group, users preferred its functional performance over its anthropomorphized social skills; In the Computer group, users highlighted its contribution to the training of their memory skills.

1016,Iterative Improvement and Marginal Gains in Coronary Revascularisation: Is Robot-assisted Percutaneous Coronary Intervention the New Hope?,"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has undergone a rapid and adaptive evolution since its introduction into clinical practice more than 40 years ago. It is the most common mode of coronary revascularisation in use, with the scope, breadth and constellation of disease being treated increasing markedly over time. This has principally been driven by improvements in technology, engineering and training in the field, which has facilitated more complex PCI procedures to be undertaken safely. Robot-assisted PCI represents the next paradigm shift in contemporary PCI practice. It has the ability to enhance procedural accuracy for the patient while improving radiation safety and ergonomics for the operator. This state-of-the-art review outlines the current position and future potential of robot-assisted PCI.",1
1017,The role of robotic surgery in the management of renal tract calculi,"The role of robotic assisted surgery in contemporary urolithiasis management is in its infancy. The mainstay in the management of renal tract calculi remains ureterorenoscopy (URS), extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). However, in rare clinical circumstances, such as large impacted pelvic and ureteric calculi, endo-urological techniques may not be adequate. Furthermore, patient may have a synchronous pathology such as pelvi-ureteric obstruction which preferably should be concurrently treated with the renal calculi in a single sitting. Robotic assisted laparoscopic ureterolithotomy (RALU), robotic assisted laparoscopic pyelolithotomy (RPL) with or without concurrent pyeloplasty and Robotic assisted laparoscopic anatrophic nephrolithotomy have all been described for complex stones. Additionally, technical challenges with a flexible ureteroscopy (FURS) have led to the development of robotic assisted flexible ureteroscopes. In the article we summarize the role of robotic assisted surgery in complex renal tract calculi.",1
1018,Resource implications of robotic thoracic surgery: what are the wider issues?,"The benefits of minimally invasive thoracic surgery are well documented when compared to the use of standard thoracotomy. Much controversy exists, however, regarding the resource implications when using robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), especially when compared to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Much of the costs attributed to a particular approach center around the frequency and severity of the complications that may arise. Little exists in the literature to appropriately compare and contrast the complication rate following either of the minimally invasive approaches. There is a suggestion that many conventional open surgeons are more readily persuaded to adopt a minimally invasive approach through the use of the robotic platform, therefore reducing the complication-related costs of standard thoracotomy by an increase in minimally invasive resection rates. Further gains may be made in the ability to perform more complex minimally invasive procedures via a RATS approach without recourse to open conversion when compared to VATS. As opportunities and competition increase in the commercial market place, it is reasonable to assume costs will fall and further savings will be made.",1
1019,Robotic pancreatectomies,"Pancreatic surgery represents one of the most challenging fields in general surgery. Its complexity is related to the severity of the disease and the technical skills required for surgical approach. Given this, most pancreatic resections are performed through classic open surgery. Minimally invasive approaches are gradually gaining widespread popularity also in this specific setting, as for distal resections and enucleations. The robotic platform, due to its 3-dimensional vision and articulated movements, represents the natural progress of laparoscopic surgery overcoming the technical defaults and opening up the possibility to perform major pancreatic resections as pancreaticoduodenectomies. This review focuses on the impact of robotic platform in pancreatic surgery in terms of surgical and oncological outcome.",3
1020,Trust as Extended Control: Human-Machine Interactions as Active Inference,"In order to interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot's behavior-and be confident about that inference (and its predictions). Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, and despite its crucial role, it is still largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human relationship to technological systems. In the following paper we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, HRC, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that it is a trade-off between benevolence and competence; while studies of human to human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We go on to introduce a model of trust as an agent' best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be casted in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. Interactive feedback is a necessary condition to the extension of the trustor's perception-action cycle. This model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration-as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust, such as the benevolence and competence attributed to the trustee, to be defined in terms of hierarchical active inference, while vulnerability can be described in terms of information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model emphasizes the role of user feedback during HRC and suggests that boredom and surprise may be used in personalized interactions as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. The description of trust as a sense of virtual control offers a crucial step toward grounding human factors in cognitive neuroscience and improving the design of human-centered technology. Furthermore, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.",4
1021,Minimally invasive surgery versus radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy for small-volume primary oropharyngeal carcinoma,"Background:
        
      
      More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are diagnosed each year worldwide and the incidence is rising, partly as a result of human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus-associated OPSCC affects younger patients and often presents at a higher stage; however, it is associated with a better prognosis.Until recently, first-line management of OPSCC involved chemoradiotherapy, as research had demonstrated comparable survival outcomes when compared with open surgery, with significantly decreased morbidity. However, interventions have now evolved with computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and the advent of endoscopic head and neck surgery, which provide the potential for decreased treatment-associated morbidity.The oropharynx plays an essential role in swallowing, speech and protecting the airway as it is situated at the bifurcation of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Treatment modality recommendations are based on survival outcomes. Given the younger patient demographic, establishing the safety of modalities that potentially have better functional outcome is becoming increasingly important.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the efficacy of endoscopic head and neck surgery (transoral robotic surgery or transoral laser microsurgery) for small-volume, primary (T1-2, N0-2) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) in comparison to radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy.
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 10); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 8 November 2016.
    


          Selection criteria:
        
      
      Randomised controlled trials in patients with carcinoma in the oropharynx subsite (as defined by the World Health Organization classification C09, C10). Cancers included were primary squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharyngeal mucosa. The tumours were classified as T1-T2 with or without nodal disease and with no evidence of distant metastatic spread. The intervention was transoral, minimally invasive surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The comparator was primary radiotherapy with or without induction or concurrent chemotherapy for the tumour. The treatments received and compared were of curative intent and patients had not undergone prior intervention, other than diagnostic biopsy.
    


          Data collection and analysis:
        
      
      We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (disease-related mortality was to be studied where possible), locoregional control, disease-free survival and progression-free survival or time to recurrence. All outcomes were to be measured at two, three and five years after diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, harms associated with treatment, patient satisfaction and xerostomia score.
    


          Main results:
        
      
      No completed studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two ongoing trials fulfilled the selection criteria, however neither are complete.'Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: radiotherapy versus trans-oral robotic surgery (ORATOR)' is a phase II randomised controlled trial comparing primary radiation therapy with primary transoral robotic surgery for small-volume primary (T1-2, N0-2) OPSCC. It is currently in progress with an estimated completion date of June 2021.'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 1420 (EORTC 1420-HNCG-ROG)' is a phase III, randomised study assessing the ""best of"" radiotherapy compared to transoral robotic surgery/transoral laser microsurgery in patients with T1-T2, N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and base of tongue. It was due to start accrual mid-2016.
    


          Authors' conclusions:
        
      
      The role of endoscopic head and neck surgery in the management of OPSCC is clearly expanding as evidenced by its more overt incorporation into the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Data are mounting regarding its outcomes both in terms of survival and lower morbidity. As confidence increases, it is being used in the management of more advanced OPSCC.Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.",1
1022,A Systematic Review of Robotic Rehabilitation for Cognitive Training,"A large and increasing number of people around the world experience cognitive disability. Rehabilitation robotics has provided promising training and assistance approaches to mitigate cognitive deficits. In this article, we carried out a systematic review on recent developments in robot-assisted cognitive training. We included 99 articles in this work and described their applications, enabling technologies, experiments, and products. We also conducted a meta analysis on the articles that evaluated robot-assisted cognitive training protocol with primary end users (i.e., people with cognitive disability). We identified major limitations in current robotics rehabilitation for cognitive training, including the small sample size, non-standard measurement of training and uncontrollable factors. There are still multifaceted challenges in this field, including ethical issues, user-centered (or stakeholder-centered) design, the reliability, trust, and cost-effectiveness, personalization of the robot-assisted cognitive training system. Future research shall also take into consideration human-robot collaboration and social cognition to facilitate a natural human-robot interaction.",1
1023,Shall I Trust You? From Child-Robot Interaction to Trusting Relationships,"Studying trust in the context of human-robot interaction is of great importance given the increasing relevance and presence of robotic agents in the social sphere, including educational and clinical. We investigated the acquisition, loss, and restoration of trust when preschool and school-age children played with either a human or a humanoid robot in vivo. The relationship between trust and the representation of the quality of attachment relationships, Theory of Mind, and executive function skills was also investigated. Additionally, to outline children's beliefs about the mental competencies of the robot, we further evaluated the attribution of mental states to the interactive agent. In general, no substantial differences were found in children's trust in the play partner as a function of agency (human or robot). Nevertheless, 3-year-olds showed a trend toward trusting the human more than the robot, as opposed to 7-year-olds, who displayed the reverse pattern. These findings align with results showing that, for 3- and 7-year-olds, the cognitive ability to switch was significantly associated with trust restoration in the human and the robot, respectively. Additionally, supporting previous findings, we found a dichotomy between attributions of mental states to the human and robot and children's behavior: while attributing to the robot significantly lower mental states than the human, in the Trusting Game, children behaved in a similar way when they related to the human and the robot. Altogether, the results of this study highlight that similar psychological mechanisms are at play when children are to establish a novel trustful relationship with a human and robot partner. Furthermore, the findings shed light on the interplay - during development - between children's quality of attachment relationships and the development of a Theory of Mind, which act differently on trust dynamics as a function of the children's age as well as the interactive partner's nature (human vs. robot).",4
1024,Long-term outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy for bladder cancer,"Background:
        
      
      Long-term oncologic and functional outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) for bladder cancer (BCa) are lacking.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To report oncologic and functional outcomes in a cohort of patients who have completed a minimum of 5 yr and a maximum of 8 yr of follow-up after RARC and extracorporeal urinary diversion.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      In this paper, we report on the experience from one of the first European urology centres to introduce RARC. Only patients between 2004 and 2006 were included to ensure follow-up of ≥ 5 yr. We report on an analysis of oncologic outcomes in 14 patients (11 males and 3 females) with muscle-invasive/high-grade non-muscle-invasive or bacillus Calmette-Guérin-refractory carcinoma in situ who opted to have RARC.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      RARC with pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed using the three-arm standard da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, CA, USA). Urinary diversion, either ileal conduit (n=12) or orthotopic neobladder (n=2), was constructed extracorporeally.
    


          Outcome measurements:
        
      
      Parameters were recorded in a prospectively maintained database including assessment of renal function, overall survival, disease-specific survival, development of metastases, and functional outcomes.
    


          Statistical analysis:
        
      
      Results were analysed using descriptive statistical analysis. Survival data were analysed and presented using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Five of the 14 patients have died. Three patients died of metastatic disease, and two died of unrelated causes. Two other patients are alive with metastases, and another has developed primary lung cancer. Six patients are alive and disease-free. These results show overall survival of 64%, disease-specific survival of 75%, and disease-free survival of 50%. None of the patients had deterioration of renal function necessitating renal replacement therapy. Three of four previously potent patients having nerve-sparing RARC recovered erectile function. The study is limited by the relatively small number of highly selected patients undergoing RARC, which was a novel technique 8 yr ago. The standard da Vinci Surgical System made extended lymphadenectomy difficult.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Within limitations, in our experience RARC achieved excellent control of local disease, but the outcomes in patients with metastatic disease seem to be equivalent to the outcomes of open radical cystectomy.",0
1025,Trust in Shared-Space Collaborative Robots: Shedding Light on the Human Brain,"Background:
        
      
      Industry 4.0 is currently underway allowing for improved manufacturing processes that leverage the collective advantages of human and robot agents. Consideration of trust can improve the quality and safety in such shared-space human-robot collaboration environments.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The use of physiological response to monitor and understand trust is currently limited due to a lack of knowledge on physiological indicators of trust. This study examines neural responses to trust within a shared-workcell human-robot collaboration task as well as discusses the use of granular and multimodal perspectives to study trust.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Sixteen sex-balanced participants completed a surface finishing task in collaboration with a UR10 collaborative robot. All participants underwent robot reliability conditions and robot assistance level conditions. Brain activation and connectivity using functional near infrared spectroscopy, subjective responses, and performance were measured throughout the study.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Significantly, increased neural activation was observed in response to faulty robot behavior within the medial and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). A similar trend was observed for the anterior PFC, primary motor cortex, and primary visual cortex. Faulty robot behavior also resulted in reduced functional connectivity strengths throughout the brain.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      These findings implicate regions in the prefrontal cortex along with specific connectivity patterns as signifiers of distrusting conditions. The neural response may be indicative of how trust is influenced, measured, and manifested for human-robot collaboration that requires active teaming.
    


          Application:
        
      
      Neuroergonomic response metrics can reveal new perspectives on trust in automation that subjective responses alone are not able to provide.",4
1026,Session 3: Intra-operative radiotherapy - creating new surgical boundaries,"In patients with advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer, surgical resection with clear margins is the greatest challenge and is limited by known anatomical constraints. Preoperative or intra-operative assessment of the limits of surgical dissection may help to explore the possibility of improving resectability through either targeted external beam radiotherapy or intra-operative radiotherapy. Professor Chang reviews the evidence base and potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach, whilst the expert panel agree a consensus on the evidence for assessment and therapy of such patients.",1
1027,Minimally invasive pelvic exenteration for gynaecological malignancy: A single-centre case series and review of the literature,"For those with certain recurrent gynaecological cancers where primary management such as chemo-radiotherapy has failed, or in cases of recurrence following primary surgery, pelvic exenteration (PE) is considered the only curative option. Whilst initially considered a morbid procedure, improved surgical techniques, advancing technology, and nuanced reconstructive options have facilitated more radical resections and improved morbidity and mortality. Open PE remains the gold standard approach, however, minimally invasive techniques for PE may lessen morbidity whilst achieving the same oncological outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive PE with a laparoscopic or robot-assisted approach. We also performed a review of the literature on robot-assisted PE which has not been widely reported for cases of recurrent gynaecological malignancy. Between 2015 and 2021six minimally invasive PE were performed. All patients underwent extensive multi-disciplinary assessment and counselling pre-operatively. Patient characteristics, treatment indication, perioperative data, short-term complications, and histological outcomes were recorded. There were two anterior exenterations, three posterior exenterations and one total exenteration performed. The primary cancer stage varied from stage 1a-3b. Five out of six patients had pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy. The average operative time (including surgical docking) was 600 min. Mean blood loss was 400 mL and the average length of stay was eight days. Enhanced recovery practices were used where possible. There were no intraoperative complications and one major post-operative complicationwhich was breakdown of an inferior gluteal artery perforator flap perineal reconstruction. All patients had negative margins at post-operative histopathology. All patients are alive and recurrence free at follow-up, but long-term outcome data is needed. This initial case series suggest that minimally invasive pelvic exenterationcan feasibly be performed in place of open pelvic exenteration. Furthermore, our findings suggest this may be a safe alternative as we report similar findings to the existing literature, however no firm conclusions can be drawn at such an early stage. Long term follow-up data and a larger cohort study will be needed to establish non-inferiority to open PE.",1
1028,Surgical robotic systems: What we have now? A urological perspective,"Introduction:
        
      
      The coming decade will see the emergence of many surgical robotic systems that need to prove their cost-effectiveness and clinical usability to gain the trust of robotic surgeons worldwide. Herein, we provide a concise review of the currently available robotic systems. Since the da Vinci Surgical System's patent expired and its market monopoly ended, many robotic surgical systems have, and will continue to, enter the market. Central to this is the challenge of gaining the trust of robotic surgeons in a cost-effective manner. However, the cumulative robotic surgical experience of Intuitive Surgical over these years-which has proven itself clinically and technically-is a great challenge for new surgical robots.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a non-systematic review of the literature, conducted through the PubMed search engine, using the following words: ""Da Vinci,"" ""robotic surgical system,"" and ""new robotic surgical device."" Further information was obtained from the robotic system companies' official websites and press releases.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The open robotic market carries great challenges for new robotic surgical systems, especially when following well-established da Vinci Surgical System. Surgeons' trust, clinical publications, technical support, and market distribution all represent separate challenges that require address.",0
1029,UVC-PURGE: A Novel Cost-Effective Disinfection Robot for Combating COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, surface disinfection using prevailing chemical disinfection methods had several limitations. Due to cost-inefficiency and the inability to disinfect shaded places, static UVC lamps cannot address these limitations properly. Moreover, the average market price of the prevailing UVC robots is huge, approximately 55,165 USD. In this research firstly, a requirement elicitation study was conducted using a semi-structured interview approach to reveal the requirements to develop a cost-effective UVC robot. Secondly, a semi-autonomous robot named UVC-PURGE was developed based on the revealed requirements. Thirdly, a two-phased evaluation study was undertaken to validate the effectiveness of UVC-PURGE to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the capability of semi-autonomous navigation in the first phase and to evaluate the usability of the system through a hybrid approach of SUPR-Q forms and subjective evaluation of the user feedback in the second phase. Pre-treatment swab testing revealed the presence of both Gram-positive and Gram-Negative bacteria at 17 out of 20 test surfaces in the conducted tests. After the UVC irradiation of the robot, the microbial load was detected in only 2 (1D and 1H) out of 17 test surfaces with significant reductions (95.33% in 1D and 90.9% in 1H) of microbial load. Moreover, the usability evaluation yields an above-average SUPR-Q score of 81.91% with significant scores in all the criteria (usability, trust, loyalty, and appearance) and the number of positive themes from the subjective evaluation using thematic analysis is twice the number of negative themes. Additionally, compared with the prevailing UVC disinfection robots in the market, UVC-PURGE is cost-effective with a price of less than 800 USD. Moreover, small form factor along with the real time camera feedback in the developed system helps the user to navigate in congested places easily. The developed robot can be used in any indoor environment in this prevailing pandemic situation and it can also provide cost-effective disinfection in medical facilities against the long-term residual effect of COVID-19 in the post-pandemic era.",0
1030,How Active Inference Could Help Revolutionise Robotics,"Recent advances in neuroscience have characterised brain function using mathematical formalisms and first principles that may be usefully applied elsewhere. In this paper, we explain how active inference-a well-known description of sentient behaviour from neuroscience-can be exploited in robotics. In short, active inference leverages the processes thought to underwrite human behaviour to build effective autonomous systems. These systems show state-of-the-art performance in several robotics settings; we highlight these and explain how this framework may be used to advance robotics.",0
1031,Novel Energy Devices in Head and Neck Robotic Surgery - ﻿A Narrative Review,"The advent of trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) has facilitated removal of tumors previously deemed unresectable, by providing access to the deep structures of the head and neck. Despite this, the wider dissemination of TORS has been restricted due to issues with line of access, as the da Vinci robot was never designed with head and neck surgery in mind. Flexible instruments and novel energy delivery devices offer great potential in overcoming some of the existing challenges surrounding TORS. This review aimed to summarize the existing literature surrounding energy delivery in TORS and highlight areas of future innovation. MEDLINE was searched for studies relating to energy delivery in TORS in November 2019. The existing literature surrounding monopolar and bipolar electrocautery, LASER (CO2, Tm:YAG and blue LASER), Ligasure and Harmonic was reviewed. Additionally, the latest iteration of the da Vinci; the SP, and the FLEX robot were evaluated as novel methods of energy delivery in TORS. Overall, these novel energy devices and robotic systems are predicted to further improve energy delivery to the head and neck. The use of flexible LASER in particular is well substantiated in the literature. This has the potential to achieve treatment de-escalation, based on the excellent outcomes demonstrated for disease-free margins and post-operative morbidity.",1
1032,Controlled Lighting and Illumination-Independent Target Detection for Real-Time Cost-Efficient Applications. The Case Study of Sweet Pepper Robotic Harvesting,"Current harvesting robots are limited by low detection rates due to the unstructured and dynamic nature of both the objects and the environment. State-of-the-art algorithms include color- and texture-based detection, which are highly sensitive to the illumination conditions. Deep learning algorithms promise robustness at the cost of significant computational resources and the requirement for intensive databases. In this paper we present a Flash-No-Flash (FNF) controlled illumination acquisition protocol that frees the system from most ambient illumination effects and facilitates robust target detection while using only modest computational resources and no supervised training. The approach relies on the simultaneous acquisition of two images-with/without strong artificial lighting (""Flash""/""no-Flash""). The difference between these images represents the appearance of the target scene as if only the artificial light was present, allowing a tight control over ambient light for color-based detection. A performance evaluation database was acquired in greenhouse conditions using an eye-in-hand RGB camera mounted on a robotic manipulator. The database includes 156 scenes with 468 images containing a total of 344 yellow sweet peppers. Performance of both color blob and deep-learning detection algorithms are compared on Flash-only and FNF images. The collected database is made public.",1
1033,Learning where to trust unreliable models in an unstructured world for deformable object manipulation,"The world outside our laboratories seldom conforms to the assumptions of our models. This is especially true for dynamics models used in control and motion planning for complex high-degree of freedom systems like deformable objects. We must develop better models, but we must also consider that, no matter how powerful our simulators or how big our datasets, our models will sometimes be wrong. What is more, estimating how wrong models are can be difficult, because methods that predict uncertainty distributions based on training data do not account for unseen scenarios. To deploy robots in unstructured environments, we must address two key questions: When should we trust a model and what do we do if the robot is in a state where the model is unreliable. We tackle these questions in the context of planning for manipulating rope-like objects in clutter. Here, we report an approach that learns a model in an unconstrained setting and then learns a classifier to predict where that model is valid, given a limited dataset of rope-constraint interactions. We also propose a way to recover from states where our model prediction is unreliable. Our method statistically significantly outperforms learning a dynamics function and trusting it everywhere. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method on real-world mock-ups of several domestic and automotive tasks.",4
1034,Magnetic-based Soft Tactile Sensors with Deformable Continuous Force Transfer Medium for Resolving Contact Locations in Robotic Grasping and Manipulation,"The resolution of contact location is important in many applications in robotics and automation. This is generally done by using an array of contact or tactile receptors, which increases cost and complexity as the required resolution or area is increased. Tactile sensors have also been developed using a continuous deformable medium between the contact and the receptors, which allows few receptors to interpolate the information among them, avoiding the weakness highlighted in the former approach. The latter is generally used to measure contact force intensity or magnitude but rarely used to identify the contact locations. This paper presents a systematic design and characterisation procedure for magnetic-based soft tactile sensors (utilizing the latter approach with the deformable contact medium) with the goal of locating the contact force location. This systematic procedure provides conditions under which design parameters can be selected, supported by a selected machine learning algorithm, to achieve the desired performance of the tactile sensor in identifying the contact location. An illustrative example, which combines a particular sensor configuration (magnetic hall effect sensor as the receptor, a selected continuous medium and a selected sensing resolution) and a specific data-driven algorithm, is used to illustrate the proposed design procedure. The results of the illustrative example design demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed design procedure and the proposed sensing strategy in identifying a contact location. The resulting sensor is also tested on a robotic hand (Allegro Hand, SimLab Co) to demonstrate its application in real-world scenarios.",4
1035,Achieving discharge within 24 h of robotic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty may be possible with appropriate patient selection and a multi-disciplinary team approach,"Aims:
        
      
      There has been significant interest in day-case and rapid discharge pathways for unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). Robotic-assisted surgery has the potential to improve surgical accuracy in UKR. However, to date there are no published studies reporting results of rapid-discharge pathways in patients receiving UKR using the NAVIO ◊ robotic system.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective analysis identified 19 patients who were safely discharged within 24 h following UKR using the NAVIO ◊ robotic system between June 2017 and October 2019. All patients went through a standardised UKR pathway protocol. Pre-operatively patients underwent education sessions and anaesthetic assessment, with selected patients undergoing occupational/physiotherapy assessment prior to surgery. All patients received a general anaesthetic with local anaesthetic infiltration prior to closure; nerve blocks were not used routinely. A multi-modal analgesic regime was utilised. Patients were discharged home once they were safe to mobilise on ward, had normal vital signs and pain was adequately controlled. Patients were discharged with outpatient physiotherapy referral and consultant follow up at 6 weeks.
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients were discharged within 24 h; there were no post-operative complications and no readmissions to hospital. The mean length of stay was 19.5 h (SD = 6.8), with patients seen twice on average by physiotherapy post-operatively. Active range of motion at 6 weeks was 105.8°, with all patients mobilising independently. The median 6-month post-operative Oxford Knee Score was 44 out of 48.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This initial feasibility study suggests that patients may be safely discharged within 24 h of UKR using the NAVIO robotic system. Appropriate patient selection will ensure successful discharge. Further prospective studies are needed.",0
1036,Systematic review of open versus laparoscopic versus robot-assisted nephroureterectomy,"Upper tract urothelial carcinoma is a relatively uncommon malignancy. The gold standard treatment for this type of neoplasm is an open radical nephroureterectomy with excision of the bladder cuff. This systematic review compares the perioperative and oncologic outcomes for the open surgical method with the alternative surgical management options of laparoscopic nephroureterectomy and robot-assisted nephroureterectomy (RANU). MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using a sensitive search strategy. Article inclusion was then assessed by review of abstracts and full papers were read if more detail was required. In all, 50 eligible studies were identified that looked at perioperative and oncologic outcomes. The range for estimated blood loss when examining observational studies was 296 to 696 mL for open nephroureterectomy (ONU), 130 to 479 mL for laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LNU), and 50 to 248 mL for RANU. The one randomized controlled trial identified reported estimated blood loss and length of stay results in which LNU was shown to be superior to ONU (P < .001). No statistical significance was found, however, following adjustment for confounding variables. Although statistically insignificant results were found when examining outcomes of RANU studies, they were promising and comparable with LNU and ONU with regard to oncologic outcomes. Results show that laparoscopic techniques are superior to ONU in perioperative results, and the longer-term oncologic outcomes look comparable. There is, however, a paucity of quality evidence regarding ONU, LNU, and RANU; data that address RANU outcomes are particularly scarce. As the robotic field within urology advances, it is hoped that this technique will be investigated further using gold standard research methods.",1
1037,Enhanced Recovery after Uterine Corpus Cancer Surgery: A 10 Year Retrospective Cohort Study of Robotic Surgery in an NHS Cancer Centre,"Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust introduced robotic surgery for uterine corpus cancer in 2010 to support increased access to minimally invasive surgery, a central element of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway. More than 1750 gynaecological oncology robotic procedures have now been performed at Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust. A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients undergoing surgery for uterine corpus cancer between the 1 January 2010 and the 31 December 2019 to evaluate its success. Data was extracted from the dedicated gynaecological oncology database and a detailed notes review performed. During this time; 952 patients received primary surgery for uterine corpus cancer; robotic: n = 734; open: n = 164; other minimally invasive surgery: n = 54. The introduction of the Da VinciTM robot to Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust was associated with an increase in the minimally invasive surgery rate. Prior to the introduction of robotic surgery in 2008 the minimally invasive surgery (MIS) rate was 33% for women with uterine corpus cancer undergoing full surgical staging. In 2019, 10 years after the start of the robotic surgery program 91.3% of women with uterine corpus cancer received robotic surgery. Overall the MIS rate increased from 33% in 2008 to 92.9% in 2019. Robotic surgery is associated with a low 30-day mortality (0.1%), low return to theatre (0.5%), a low use of blood transfusion and intensive care (1.8% & 7.2% respectively), low conversion to open surgery (0.5%) and a reduction in median length of stay from 6 days (in 2008) to 1 day, regardless of age/BMI. Robotic survival is consistent with published data. Introduction of the robotic program for the treatment of uterine cancer increased productivity and was associated with a highly predicable patient pathway of care, for high-risk patients, with reduced demands on health services. Future health care commissioning should further expand access to robotic surgery nationally for women with uterine corpus cancer.",3
1038,Interoperability Among Unmanned Maritime Vehicles: Review and First In-field Experimentation,"Complex maritime missions, both above and below the surface, have traditionally been carried out by manned surface ships and submarines equipped with advanced sensor systems. Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs) are increasingly demonstrating their potential for improving existing naval capabilities due to their rapid deployability, easy scalability, and high reconfigurability, offering a reduction in both operational time and cost. In addition, they mitigate the risk to personnel by leaving the man far-from-the-risk but in-the-loop of decision making. In the long-term, a clear interoperability framework between unmanned systems, human operators, and legacy platforms will be crucial for effective joint operations planning and execution. However, the present multi-vendor multi-protocol solutions in multi-domain UMVs activities are hard to interoperate without common mission control interfaces and communication protocol schemes. Furthermore, the underwater domain presents significant challenges that cannot be satisfied with the solutions developed for terrestrial networks. In this paper, the interoperability topic is discussed blending a review of the technological growth from 2000 onwards with recent authors' in-field experience; finally, important research directions for the future are given. Within the broad framework of interoperability in general, the paper focuses on the aspect of interoperability among UMVs not neglecting the role of the human operator in the loop. The picture emerging from the review demonstrates that interoperability is currently receiving a high level of attention with a great and diverse deal of effort. Besides, the manuscript describes the experience from a sea trial exercise, where interoperability has been demonstrated by integrating heterogeneous autonomous UMVs into the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) network, using different robotic middlewares and acoustic modem technologies to implement a multistatic active sonar system. A perspective for the interoperability in marine robotics missions emerges in the paper, through a discussion of current capabilities, in-field experience and future advanced technologies unique to UMVs. Nonetheless, their application spread is slowed down by the lack of human confidence. In fact, an interoperable system-of-systems of autonomous UMVs will require operators involved only at a supervisory level. As trust develops, endorsed by stable and mature interoperability, human monitoring will be diminished to exploit the tremendous potential of fully autonomous UMVs.",0
1039,A Compliance-Reactance Framework for Evaluating Human-Robot Interaction,"When do we follow requests and recommendations and which ones do we choose not to comply with? This publication combines definitions of compliance and reactance as behaviours and as affective processes in one model for application to human-robot interaction. The framework comprises three steps: human perception, comprehension, and selection of an action following a cue given by a robot. The paper outlines the application of the model in different study settings such as controlled experiments that allow for the assessment of cognition as well as observational field studies that lack this possibility. Guidance for defining and measuring compliance and reactance is outlined and strategies for improving robot behaviour are derived for each step in the process model. Design recommendations for each step are condensed into three principles on information economy, adequacy, and transparency. In summary, we suggest that in order to maximise the probability of compliance with a cue and to avoid reactance, interaction designers should aim for a high probability of perception, a high probability of comprehension and prevent negative affect. Finally, an example application is presented that uses existing data from a laboratory experiment in combination with data collected in an online survey to outline how the model can be applied to evaluate a new technology or interaction strategy using the concepts of compliance and reactance as behaviours and affective constructs.",0
1040,Inexpensive Complex Hand Model Twenty Years Later,"Twenty years ago the author unveiled his inexpensive complex hand model, which reproduced every motion of the human hand. A control system programmed in the Forth language operated its actuators and sensors. Follow-on papers for this popular project were next presented in Texas, Canada and Germany. From this hand grew the authors meter-tall robot (nicknamed ANNIE: Android With Neural Networks, Intellect and Emotions). It received machine vision, facial expressiveness, speech synthesis and speech recognition; a simian version also received a dexterous ape foot. New artificial intelligence features included op-amp neurons for OCR and simulated emotions, hormone emulation, endocannabinoid receptors, fear-trust-love mechanisms, a Grandmother Cell recognizer and artificial consciousness. Simulated illnesses included narcotic addiction, autism, PTSD, fibromyalgia and Alzheimers disease. The author gave 13 robotics-AI presentations at NASA in Houston since 2006. A meter-tall simian robot was proposed with gripping hand-feet for use with space vehicles and to explore distant planets and moons. Also proposed were: intelligent motorized exoskeletons for astronaut force multiplication; a cognitive prosthesis to detect and alleviate decreased crew mental performance; and a gynoid robot medic to tend astronauts in deep space missions. What began as a complex hand model evolved into an innovative robot-AI within two decades.",0
1041,Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery: First Report from the Caribbean,"Although advanced minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery were well accepted in developed countries by the turn of the 21st century, they did not enjoy the same popularity in the Anglophone Caribbean. Advanced minimally invasive surgery only became available in select Caribbean countries from the year 2010. And up to the year 2021, robotic surgery was completely non-existent in the Anglophone Caribbean. Surgical leaders in the Anglophone Caribbean recognized a need to encourage the introduction of advanced surgical techniques in the region and engaged local and international stakeholders in an attempt to stimulate this development. In the year 2021, through a collaborative effort by a local medical university, a government-funded hospital, and industry partners in the United Kingdom, robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery was successfully introduced to the Caribbean. We report our experience of introducing robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery in the Eastern Caribbean. By discussing the pitfalls and successes from our experience, we hope that the lessons can be used to guide the introduction of robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery in other resource-poor countries in the Caribbean.​.",1
1042,Overview of robotic colorectal surgery: Current and future practical developments,"Minimal access surgery has revolutionised colorectal surgery by offering reduced morbidity and mortality over open surgery, while maintaining oncological and functional outcomes with the disadvantage of additional practical challenges. Robotic surgery aids the surgeon in overcoming these challenges. Uptake of robotic assistance has been relatively slow, mainly because of the high initial and ongoing costs of equipment but also because of limited evidence of improved patient outcomes. Advances in robotic colorectal surgery will aim to widen the scope of minimal access surgery to allow larger and more complex surgery through smaller access and natural orifices and also to make the technology more economical, allowing wider dispersal and uptake of robotic technology. Advances in robotic endoscopy will yield self-advancing endoscopes and a widening role for capsule endoscopy including the development of motile and steerable capsules able to deliver localised drug therapy and insufflation as well as being recharged from an extracorporeal power source to allow great longevity. Ultimately robotic technology may advance to the point where many conventional surgical interventions are no longer required. With respect to nanotechnology, surgery may eventually become obsolete.",1
1043,Minimally invasive pancreatic surgery - a review,"During the past 20 years the application of a minimally invasive approach to pancreatic surgery has progressively increased. Distal pancreatectomy is the most frequently performed procedure, because of the absence of a reconstructive phase. However, middle pancreatectomy and pancreatoduodenectomy have been demonstrated to be safe and feasible as well. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is recognized as the gold standard treatment for small tumors of the pancreatic body-tail, with several advantages over the traditional open approach in terms of patient recovery. The surgical treatment of lesions of the pancreatic head via a minimally invasive approach is still limited to a few highly experienced surgeons, due to the very challenging resection and complex anastomoses. Middle pancreatectomy and enucleation are indicated for small and benign tumors and offer the maximum preservation of the parenchyma. The introduction of a robotic platform more than ten years ago increased the interest of many surgeons in minimally invasive treatment of pancreatic diseases. This new technology overcomes all the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, but actual benefits for the patients are still under investigation. The increased costs associated with robotic surgery are under debate too. This article presents the state of the art of minimally invasive pancreatic surgery.",3
1044,A Constant-Force End-Effector With Online Force Adjustment for Robotic Ultrasonography,"In this letter, we propose a novel constant-force end-effector (CFEE) to address current limitations in robotic ultrasonography. The CFEE uses a parallel, motor-spring-based solution to precisely generate constant operating forces over a wide range and enable the ultrasound (US) probe to adapt to the abdominal contours autonomously. A displacement measurement unit was developed to realize the acquisition of probe position and precise control of the operating force. Moreover, the operating force can be adjusted online to maintain safety and continuity of operation. Simulations and experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance. Results show that the proposed CFEE can provide constant forces of 4-12 N with displacements of 0-8 mm. The maximum relative error of force generation is 8.28%, and the accuracy and precision for displacement measurement are 0.29 mm and ±0.16 mm, respectively. Various operating forces can be adjusted online during the same operation. Ultrasound images acquired by the proposed CFEE are of equally good quality compared to a manual sonographer scan. The proposed CFEE would have potential further medical applications.",4
1045,Proprioceptive deficits in inactive older adults are not reflected in fast targeted reaching movements,"During normal healthy ageing there is a decline in the ability to control simple movements, characterised by increased reaction times, movement durations and variability. There is also growing evidence of age-related proprioceptive loss which may contribute to these impairments. However, this relationship has not been studied in detail for the upper limb. We recruited 20 younger adults (YAs) and 31 older adults (OAs) who each performed 2 tasks on a 2D robotic manipulandum. The first assessed dynamic proprioceptive acuity using active, multi-joint movements constrained by the robot to a pre-defined path. Participants made perceptual judgements of the lateral position of the unseen arm. The second task required fast, accurate and discrete movements to the same targets in the absence of visual feedback of the hand, and without robotic intervention. We predicted that the variable proprioceptive error (uncertainty range) assessed in Task 1 would be increased in physically inactive OAs and would predict increased movement variability in Task 2. Instead we found that physically inactive OAs had larger systematic proprioceptive errors (bias) than YAs (t[33] = 2.8, p = 0.009), and neither proprioceptive uncertainty nor bias was related to motor performance in either age group (all regression model R2 ≤ 0.06). We suggest that previously reported estimates of proprioceptive decline with ageing may be exaggerated by task demands and that the extent of these deficits is unrelated to control of discrete, rapid movement. The relationship between dynamic proprioceptive acuity and movement control in other tasks with greater emphasis on online feedback is still unclear and warrants further investigation.",5
1046,Adaptive Cognitive Mechanisms to Maintain Calibrated Trust and Reliance in Automation,"Trust calibration for a human-machine team is the process by which a human adjusts their expectations of the automation's reliability and trustworthiness; adaptive support for trust calibration is needed to engender appropriate reliance on automation. Herein, we leverage an instance-based learning ACT-R cognitive model of decisions to obtain and rely on an automated assistant for visual search in a UAV interface. This cognitive model matches well with the human predictive power statistics measuring reliance decisions; we obtain from the model an internal estimate of automation reliability that mirrors human subjective ratings. The model is able to predict the effect of various potential disruptions, such as environmental changes or particular classes of adversarial intrusions on human trust in automation. Finally, we consider the use of model predictions to improve automation transparency that account for human cognitive biases in order to optimize the bidirectional interaction between human and machine through supporting trust calibration. The implications of our findings for the design of reliable and trustworthy automation are discussed.",0
1047,Surgeon-Team Separation in Robotic Theaters: A Qualitative Observational and Interview Study,"Background:
        
      
      The rapid uptake of robotic surgery has largely been driven by the improved technical aspects of minimally invasive surgery including improved ergonomics, wristed instruments, and 3-dimensional vision. However, little attention has been given to the effect of physical separation of the surgeon from the rest of the operating team.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to examine in depth how this separation affected team dynamics and staff emotions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Robotic procedures were observed in 2 tertiary hospitals, and laparoscopic/open procedures were added for comparison; field notes were taken instantaneously. One-to-one interviews with theater team members were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis was conducted via grounded theory approach using NVIVO11.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Twenty-nine participants (26 interviewed) were recruited to the study (11 females) and 134 (109 robotic) hours of observation were completed across gynecology, urology, and colorectal surgery.The following 3 main themes emerged with compounding factors identified: (a) communication challenge, (b) immersion versus distraction, and (c) emotional impact. Compounding factors included the following: individual and team experience, staffing levels, and the physical theater environment.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our emergent theory is that ""surgeon-team separation in robotic theaters poses communication challenges which impacts on situational awareness and staff emotions."" These can be ameliorated by staff training, increased experience, and team/procedure consistency.",3
1048,"A comparison between robotic, laparoscopic and open hepatectomy: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","Background:
        
      
      The evidence of pairwise meta-analysis of Robotic Hepatectomy (RH) vs Laparoscopic Hepatectomy (LH) and RH vs Open Hepatectomy (OH) is inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this study, was to compare the outcomes of RH, LH and OH by performing a network meta-analysis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was performed in the following databases: Pubmed, Google scholar, EMBASE and Cochrane library. Cost-effectiveness and survival benefits were selected as primary outcomes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The cost was less in OH compared to both minimally invasive procedures, LH demonstrated lower cost compared to RH, but the differences were not statistically significant. Both the RH and LH cohorts demonstrated significantly lower estimated blood loss, reduced major morbidity rate and shorter length of stay compared to OH cohort. The LH and OH cohorts demonstrated significantly shorter operative time and duration of clamping compared to the RH cohort. The LH cohort included significantly smaller tumours compared to the OH cohort.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The present network meta-analysis, demonstrated that both RH and LH in malignant and benign conditions were associated with lower morbidity rates, shorter hospital stay and the procedure related costs were statistically nonsignificant between RH, LH and OH.",5
1049,"International Summit on Laparoscopic Pancreatic Resection (ISLPR) ""Coimbatore Summit Statements""","The International Summit on Laparoscopic Pancreatic Resection (ISLPR) was held in Coimbatore, India, on 7th and 8th of October 2016 and thirty international experts who regularly perform laparoscopic pancreatic resections participated in ISPLR from four continents, i.e., South and North America, Europe and Asia. Prior to ISLPR, the first conversation among the experts was made online on August 26th, 2016 and the structures of ISPLR were developed. The aims of ISPLR were; i) to identify indications and optimal case selection criteria for minimally invasive pancreatic resection (MIPR) in the setting of both benign and malignant diseases; ii) standardization of techniques to increase the safety of MIPR; iii) identification of common problems faced during MIPR and developing associated management strategies; iv) development of clinical protocols to allow early identification of complications and develop the accompanying management plan to minimize morbidity and mortality. As a process for interactive discussion, the experts were requested to complete an online questionnaire consisting of 65 questions about the various technical aspects of laparoscopic pancreatic resections. Two further web-based meetings were conducted prior to ISPLR. Through further discussion during ISPLR, we have created productive statements regarding the topics of Disease, Implementation, Patients, Techniques, and Instrumentations (DIPTI) and hereby publish them as ""Coimbatore Summit Statements"".",3
1050,Multivisceral robotic resection: a glimpse into the future of minimally invasive abdominal surgery,"A 62-year-old man was referred to the Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary (HPB) surgeons with left upper quadrant discomfort. The initial investigations and CT scans revealed a tumour in the pancreatic tail with liver metastases, confirmed on MRI. It was initially thought to be an adenocarcinoma; however, further investigations found that it was a grade 1 neuroendocrine tumour with Ki 67 at 1% and it was agreed that he would undergo a total robotic surgery involving resection of the locally advanced tumour of the tail of pancreas, with the involvement of the stomach, and splenic flexure of the colon with liver metastases. The resulting procedure was a total robotic distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, sleeve resection of stomach, cholecystectomy, atypical resection of two liver lesions and microwave ablation of multiple liver lesions. Four days post-operatively, he was discharged from hospital and commenced adjuvant chemotherapy. He currently enjoys a good quality of life.",3
1051,Promoting Functional and Independent Sitting in Children With Cerebral Palsy Using the Robotic Trunk Support Trainer,"Seated postural abilities are critical to functional independence and participation in children with cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) levels III-IV. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated the feasibility of a motor learning-based seated postural training with a robotic Trunk-Support-Trainer (TruST) in a longitudinal single-subject-design (13y, GMFCS IV), and its potential effectiveness in a group of 3 children (6-14y, GMFCS III-IV). TruST is a motorized-cable driven belt placed on the child's trunk to exert active-assistive forces when the trunk moves beyond stability limits. TruST-intervention addresses postural-task progression by tailoring the assistive-force fields to the child's sitting balance to train trunk control during independent short-sitting posture. TruST-intervention consisted of 2 training blocks of six 2hour-sessions per block (3 sessions per week). Pelvic strapping was required in the 1st block to prevent falls. As primary outcomes, we used the modified functional reach test, gross motor function measure-item set (GMFM-IS), Box & Blocks, and postural kinematics. After TruST-intervention children did not require pelvic strapping to prevent a fall, improved trunk stability during reaching (baseline = 5.49cm, 1week post-training = 16.38cm, 3mos follow-up = 14.63cm, ) and increased their sitting workspace (baseline = 127.55cm2, 1week post-training, = 409.92cm2, 3mos follow-up = 270.03cm2, ). Three children also improved in the GMFM-IS. In summary, our novel robotic TruST-intervention is feasible and can effectively maximize functional independent sitting in children with CP GMFCS III-IV.",0
1052,Effects on Symptoms of Agitation and Depression in Persons With Dementia Participating in Robot-Assisted Activity: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objectives:
        
      
      To examine effects on symptoms of agitation and depression in nursing home residents with moderate to severe dementia participating in a robot-assisted group activity with the robot seal Paro.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A cluster-randomized controlled trial. Ten nursing home units were randomized to either robot-assisted intervention or a control group with treatment as usual during 3 intervention periods from 2013 to 2014.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Ten adapted units in nursing homes in 3 counties in eastern Norway.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Sixty residents (67% women, age range 62-95 years) in adapted nursing home units with a dementia diagnosis or cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score lower than 25/30).
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      Group sessions with Paro took place in a separate room at nursing homes for 30 minutes twice a week over the course of 12 weeks. Local nurses were trained to conduct the intervention.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Participants were scored on baseline measures (T0) assessing cognitive status, regular medication, agitation (BARS), and depression (CSDD). The data collection was repeated at end of intervention (T1) and at follow-up (3 months after end of intervention) (T2). Mixed models were used to test treatment and time effects.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Statistically significant differences in changes were found on agitation and depression between groups from T0 to T2. Although the symptoms of the intervention group declined, the control group's symptoms developed in the opposite direction. Agitation showed an effect estimate of -5.51, CI 0.06-10.97, P = .048, and depression -3.88, CI 0.43-7.33, P = .028. There were no significant differences in changes on either agitation or depression between groups from T0 to T1.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study found a long-term effect on depression and agitation by using Paro in activity groups for elderly with dementia in nursing homes. Paro might be a suitable nonpharmacological treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms and should be considered as a useful tool in clinical practice.",6
1053,Nurses' perspectives of taking care of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019: A phenomenological study,"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought significant pressure on nurses globally as they are the frontline of care. This study aimed to explore the experiences and challenges of nurses who worked with hospitalised patients with COVID-19. In this qualitative study, a purposive sample of 14 nurses participated in in-depth telephone interviews. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Five key themes emerged: (1) physical and psychological distress of nurses, (2) willingness to work, (3) the essential role of support mechanisms, (4) educational and informational needs of nurses and (5) the role of modern technology in COVID-19 care. Although the provision of care led to physical and psychological distress among nurses, with their commitment and professional obligation, it is a new experience that leads to personal satisfaction. Guilty feeling related to inefficiency of care, witnessing the suffering of patients, discomfort associated with wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), work-related issues (e.g., long hour shifts), negative impact to the family and rejection by others are the leading distress factors. Religious beliefs, including keeping trust in good and bad merits, have become a strong coping mechanism. Addressing distress among nurses is essential. The reported learning needs of nurses included skills related to donning and doffing PPE, skills in performing nursing procedures and breaking bad news. Nurse managers need to pay special attention to expanding training opportunities as well as support mechanisms, for example, welfare, appreciations and counselling services for nurses. Modern technology, particularly robots and telecommunication, can perform an essential role in COVID-19 care. The establishment of timely policies and strategies to protect health workers during a national disaster like COVID-19 is needed.",3
1054,Morbidity related to the lip-split mandibulotomy approach: a systematic and narrative review,"The lip-split mandibulotomy (LSMA) is an access procedure that has been used in head and neck (H&N) surgery as an aid to surgical resection of inaccessible tumours of the postertior oral cavity and oropharynx. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it has significant morbidity. Voices of concern within the H&N surgical community suggest that it has been abandoned in favour of technological advances such as robotic surgery. We report here the first (to our knowledge) registered systematic review of its kind, documenting the safety and efficiency of LSMA in H&N surgery. We performed a PRISMA-guided systematic review (PROSPERO-registered) and identified reports using a search algorithm in MEDLINE/EMBASE. LSMA-related surgical complications were recorded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Secondary outcomes included swallowing dysfunction, facial cosmesis, and patient satisfaction recorded in health-related quality of life questionnaires (HRQoL). From 125 studies identified, 54 met the inclusion criteria (3872 patients). The LSMA mortality rate was 0%; we did not identify a single case of perioperative death. The median rate of osteoradionecrosis was 5.4%, whereas fistula formation was 5.7%. Malunion was noted in 4.9%. Other complications (surgical site infection, plate exposure) were around 5%. There was significant between-study variation with regards to swallowing assessment tools, but overall there was no significant difference in outcomes. This was also the case for the HRQoL questionairres. LSMA is a safe procedure with an acceptable rate of complications, and should definitely remain in the armamentarium of H&N surgery.",1
1055,Development of a technical checklist for the assessment of suturing in robotic surgery,"Background:
        
      
      With the increased use of simulation for surgical training, there is a need for objective forms of assessment to evaluate trainees. The Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) is widely used for assessing skills in robotic surgery, but there are no recognised checklist scoring systems. This study aimed to develop a checklist for suturing in robotic surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A suturing checklist for needle driving and knot tying was constructed following evaluation of participants performing urethrovesical anastomoses. Key procedural steps were identified from expert videos, while assessing novice videos allowed identification of common technical errors. 22 novice and 13 expert videos were marked on needle driving, while 18 novices and 10 experts were assessed on knot tying. Validation of the finalised checklist was performed with the assessment of 39 separate novices by an expert surgeon and compared to GEARS scoring.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The internal consistency of the preliminary checklist was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.870 for needle driving items; 0.736 for knot tying items), and after removal of poorly correlating items, the final checklist contained 23 steps. Both the needle driving and knot tying categories discriminated between novices and experts, p < 0.005. While the GEARS score demonstrated construct validity for needle driving, it could not significantly differentiate between novices and experts for knot tying, p = 0.286. The needle driving category significantly correlated with the corresponding GEARS scores (rs = 0.613, p < 0.005), but the correlation for knot tying was insignificant (rs = 0.296, p = 0.127). The pilot data indicates the checklist significantly correlated with the GEARS score (p < 0.005).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study reports the development of a valid assessment tool for suturing in robotic surgery. Given that checklists are simple to use, there is significant scope for this checklist to be used in surgical training.",3
1056,Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is associated with earlier discharge from physiotherapy and reduced length-of-stay compared to conventional navigated techniques,"Introduction:
        
      
      Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) has been used to improve intraoperative accuracy to restore patient's anatomy and joint kinematics. It is not yet known whether robotic systems provide significant benefits over established navigation techniques.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Thirty-one patients underwent robotic-assisted UKA (RA-UKA) over a 14-month period. Length of operation, transfusion requirements, time to discharge, range-of-motion and analgesia requirements were compared to a similar cohort of 31 patients who had received UKA using computer-assisted surgery (CAS-UKA).
    


          Results:
        
      
      All patients in the RA-UKA and CAS-UKA groups underwent surgery without conversion to conventional techniques. Both cohorts were similar apart from mean BMI (RA-UKA-group 28.5 vs 32.2; p < 0.05). There was a higher percentage of females in the CAS-UKA group (68% vs 45%, p = 0.12). Minor complication rates were the same in both groups (4/31, 12.9%). Mean operating time was longer in the RA-UKA group (104.8 vs 85.6 min; p < 0.001). No patients required post-operative transfusion in either group and there was no significant difference in haemoglobin level drop or analgesia requirements at any time point. Patients in the RA-UKA group achieved straight leg raise without lag sooner (23 vs 37.5 h; p = 0.004) and demonstrated increased range-of-motion on discharge (81.4° vs 64.5°; p < 0.001). Patients in the RA-UKA group were discharged from physiotherapy services earlier than the CAS-UKA group (42.5 vs 49 h; p = 0.02) and discharged from hospital significantly sooner (46 vs 74 h; p = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RA-UKA is safe and reproducible, comparable to traditional navigation. Patients undergoing RA-UKA achieve straight leg raise and discharge from physiotherapy sooner than with navigation alone.

1057,Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer in thalidomide generation,"Thalidomide was used in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a sedative for morning sickness in pregnant women. It resulted in thousands of babies being born with various congenital anomalies, such as phocomelia. Subsequently, the drug was banned for this indication. Most of the survivors have become thalidomide adults and now they are in their fifties. We report the first case of a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in a 54-year-old male with prostate cancer and phocomelia as a result of thalidomide embryopathy. He presented with a PSA of 3.3 and was diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer. An extra peritoneal approach was chosen due to his body habitus and to avoid extreme Trendelenburg tilt. Side docking with the da Vinci robot was employed and the prostatectomy was carried out in the standard extra peritoneal fashion. At 6 months' follow-up his PSA is unrecordable and he is voiding well with minimal urinary incontinence, requiring 1 pad/day. We aim to outline our approach and highlight the technical modifications in this rare physically disabling condition.",0
1058,Cerebral oedema following robotic surgery: a rare complication,"Introduction:
        
      
      We present an unusual complication following robotic assisted radical hysterectomy.
    


          Case report:
        
      
      A 51-year-old female with stage 1B1 cervical cancer underwent a robotic assisted radical hysterectomy. The procedure was prolonged with difficulties dissecting the left parametrium and vaginal fornix with persistent bleeding from the left vaginal vault. Post-operatively the patient was electively sedated and ventilated. Extubation was difficult due to patient agitation but achieved on day 2. Agitation persisted and a head CT scan was performed and a diagnosis of cerebral oedema was made.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      Factors contributing to this case include prolonged operating time, prolonged Trendelenburg position with high pressures of CO2 pneumoperitoneum and excessive blood loss. These factors may contribute to poor cerebral venous outflow, increasing intracranial pressure leading to increased risk of cerebral oedema.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The mechanics of robotic assistance may be used to reduce these risks by significantly reducing intra-abdominal pressure improving venous return. The use of robotics in surgery has been increasing over the last 10 years, and the benefits have been well documented. We present an unusual complication following robotic assisted radical hysterectomy performed for cervical cancer.",9
1059,"TORS for OSA: a practice, pitfalls and literature review","Purpose:
        
      
      Trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) is increasingly employed in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) management. Objective outcomes are generally assessed through polysomnography. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be a useful adjunct in objective upper airway assessment, in particular the tongue base, providing useful information for surgical planning and outcome assessment, though care must be taken in patient positioning during surgery. The purpose of this paper is to identify pitfalls in this process and suggest a protocol for pre-operative MRI scanning in OSA.
    


          Design/methodology/approach:
        
      
      This study is a four-patient prospective case-series and literature review. Outcome measures include pre- and post-operative volumetric changes in the pharynx as measured on MRI and apnoea-hypopnea indices (AHI), with cure being OSA resolution or a 50 per cent reduction in AHI.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      All patients achieved AHI reduction and/or OSA cure following TORS, despite a decrease in pharyngeal volume measurements at the tongue base level. This study and others lacked standardisation in the MRI scanning protocol, which resulted in an inability to effectively compare pre- and post-operative scans. Pitfalls were related to variation in head/tongue position, soft-tissue marker usage and assessed area boundary limits.
    


          Practical implications:
        
      
      TORS appears to be effective in OSA management. A new protocol for patient positioning and anatomical landmarks is suggested.
    


          Originality/value:
        
      
      The findings could provide directly comparable data between scans and may allow correlation between tongue base volumetric changes and AHI through subsequent and historical study meta-analysis.",0
1060,"Effects of two different protocols of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation combined with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on robot-assisted gait training in patients with chronic supratentorial stroke: A single blind, randomized controlled trial","Background:
        
      
      The neural organization of locomotion involves motor patterns generated by spinal interneuronal networks and supraspinal structures, which are approachable by noninvasive stimulation techniques. Recent evidences supported the hypothesis that transcranial direct current stimulation (combined with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation) may actually enhance the effects of robot-assisted gait training in chronic stroke patients. The cerebellum has many connections to interact with neocortical areas and may provide some peculiar plasticity mechanisms. So, it has been proposed as ""non-lesioned entry"" to the motor or cognitive system for the application of noninvasive stimulation techniques in patients with supratentorial stroke.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To compare the effects of two different protocols of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation combined with transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on robotic gait training in patients with chronic supratentorial stroke.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty patients with chronic supratentorial stroke were randomly assigned into two groups. All patients received ten, 20-minute robotic gait training sessions, five days a week, for two consecutive weeks. Group 1 underwent cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the contralesional cerebellar hemisphere + cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation in combination with robotic training. Group 2 underwent cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the ipsilesional cerebellar hemisphere + cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation in combination with robotic training. The primary outcome was the 6-minute walk test performed before, after, and at follow-up at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      No significant difference in the 6-minute walk test between groups was found at the first post-treatment evaluation (P = 0.976), as well as at the 2-week (P = 0.178) and the 4-week (P = 0.069) follow-up evaluations. Both groups showed significant within-group improvements in the 6-minute walk test at all time points.∥Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the contralesional or ipsilesional cerebellar hemisphere in combination with cathodal transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation may lead to similar effects on robotic gait training in chronic supratentorial stroke patients.",6
1061,"Robotic Head and Neck Surgery: History, Technical Evolution and the Future","The first application of robotic technology in surgery was described in 1985 when a robot was used to define the trajectory for a stereotactic brain biopsy. Following its successful application in a variety of surgical operations, the da Vinci® robot, the most widely used surgical robot at present, made its clinical debut in otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery in 2005 when the first transoral robotic surgery (TORS) resections of base of tongue neoplasms were reported. Subsequently, the indications for TORS rapidly expanded, and they now include tumours of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, parapharyngeal space, and supraglottic larynx, as well as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The da Vinci® robot has also been successfully used for scarless-in-the-neck thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. At present, the main barrier to the wider uptake of robotic surgery is the prohibitive cost of the da Vinci® robotic system. Several novel, flexible surgical robots are currently being developed that are likely to not only enhance patient safety and expand current indications but also drive down costs, thus making this innovation more widely available. Future directions relate to overlay technology through augmented reality/AR that allows real-time image-guidance, miniaturisation (nanorobots), and the development of autonomous robots.",1
1062,Robotic vs laparoscopic rectal surgery in high-risk patients,"Aim:
        
      
      Laparoscopic rectal surgery is associated with a steep learning curve and high conversion rate despite progress in equipment design and consistent practice. The robotic system has shown an advantage over the laparoscopic approach due to stable three-dimensional views, improved dexterity and better ergonomics. These factors make the robotic approach more favourable for rectal surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic and robotic rectal cancer surgery in high-risk patients.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A prospectively collected dataset for high-risk patients who underwent rectal cancer surgery between May 2013 and November 2015 was analysed. Patients with any of the following characteristics were defined as high risk: a body mass index ≥30, male gender, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, tumour <8 cm from the anal verge and previous abdominal surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 184 high-risk patients were identified: 99 in the robotic group and 85 in the laparoscopic group. Robotic surgery was associated with a significantly higher sphincter preservation rate (86% vs 74%, P = 0.045), shorter operative time (240 vs 270 min, P = 0.013) and hospital stay (7 vs 9 days, P = 0.001), less blood loss (10 vs 100 ml, P < 0.001) and a smaller conversion rate to open surgery (0% vs 5%, P = 0.043) compared with the laparoscopic technique. Reoperation, anastomotic leak rate, 30-day mortality and oncological outcomes were comparable between the two techniques.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic surgery in high-risk patients is associated with higher sphincter preservation, reduced blood loss, smaller conversion rates, and shorter operating time and hospital stay. However, further studies are required to evaluate this notion.",9
1063,Use of intraoperative fluorescence to enhance robot-assisted radical prostatectomy,"Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy has become the standard of care for the removal of localized prostate cancer. Positive outcomes depend upon the precise removal of the prostate and associated tissue without damage to nearby structures. This process can be aided by fluorescence-guided surgery to enhance the visual contrast between different structures. Here the authors have conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to identify ten investigations into the use of fluorescence-guided surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. These studies used fluorescent tracers to identify structures, including the prostate, neurovascular bundle and lymph nodes. These studies demonstrate the safe and effective use of fluorescence-guided surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pave the way for further developments in this field.",1
1064,The Development of Overtrust: An Empirical Simulation and Psychological Analysis in the Context of Human-Robot Interaction,"With impressive developments in human-robot interaction it may seem that technology can do anything. Especially in the domain of social robots which suggest to be much more than programmed machines because of their anthropomorphic shape, people may overtrust the robot's actual capabilities and its reliability. This presents a serious problem, especially when personal well-being might be at stake. Hence, insights about the development and influencing factors of overtrust in robots may form an important basis for countermeasures and sensible design decisions. An empirical study [N = 110] explored the development of overtrust using the example of a pet feeding robot. A 2 × 2 experimental design and repeated measurements contrasted the effect of one's own experience, skill demonstration, and reputation through experience reports of others. The experiment was realized in a video environment where the participants had to imagine they were going on a four-week safari trip and leaving their beloved cat at home, making use of a pet feeding robot. Every day, the participants had to make a choice: go to a day safari without calling options (risk and reward) or make a boring car trip to another village to check if the feeding was successful and activate an emergency call if not (safe and no reward). In parallel to cases of overtrust in other domains (e.g., autopilot), the feeding robot performed flawlessly most of the time until in the fourth week; it performed faultily on three consecutive days, resulting in the cat's death if the participants had decided to go for the day safari on these days. As expected, with repeated positive experience about the robot's reliability on feeding the cat, trust levels rapidly increased and the number of control calls decreased. Compared to one's own experience, skill demonstration and reputation were largely neglected or only had a temporary effect. We integrate these findings in a conceptual model of (over)trust over time and connect these to related psychological concepts such as positivism, instant rewards, inappropriate generalization, wishful thinking, dissonance theory, and social concepts from human-human interaction. Limitations of the present study as well as implications for robot design and future research are discussed.",4
1065,Going under Dr. Robot's knife: the effects of robot anthropomorphism and mortality salience on attitudes toward autonomous robot surgeons,"Objective:
        
      
      This study sought to experimentally test two potential factors that could affect the consumer acceptance of autonomous robot surgeons: anthropomorphism and mortality salience. The study also investigated the effect of gender and its interaction with anthropomorphism on attitudes toward autonomous robot surgeons.
    


          Design and main outcome measures:
        
      
      A between-subjects experiment with a 2 (anthropomorphism: low vs. high) x 2 (mortality salience: no vs. yes) factorial design was conducted (N = 196). The trust in the autonomous surgical robot and the willingness to undergo autonomous robotic surgery served as the dependent variables.
    


          Results:
        
      
      When death thoughts were not active, the human-likeness of the autonomous surgical robot significantly increased the trust in the robot and the willingness to undergo autonomous robotic surgery. Activating death thoughts did not further increase the positive attitudes toward the higher-anthropomorphic robot, while it significantly increased the trust in and the willingness to be operated on by the lower-anthropomorphic robot, rendering both robots comparable. This study also found that women had less positive attitudes toward the autonomous robot surgeon, regardless of the robot's human-likeness.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Anthropomorphism and mortality salience can both positively affect the acceptance of autonomous robotic surgery but only in the absence of one another.",4
1066,"A Survey of Expectations About the Role of Robots in Robot-Assisted Therapy for Children with ASD: Ethical Acceptability, Trust, Sociability, Appearance, and Attachment","The use of robots in therapy for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) raises issues concerning the ethical and social acceptability of this technology and, more generally, about human-robot interaction. However, usually philosophical papers on the ethics of human-robot-interaction do not take into account stakeholders' views; yet it is important to involve stakeholders in order to render the research responsive to concerns within the autism and autism therapy community. To support responsible research and innovation in this field, this paper identifies a range of ethical, social and therapeutic concerns, and presents and discusses the results of an exploratory survey that investigated these issues and explored stakeholders' expectations about this kind of therapy. We conclude that although in general stakeholders approve of using robots in therapy for children with ASD, it is wise to avoid replacing therapists by robots and to develop and use robots that have what we call supervised autonomy. This is likely to create more trust among stakeholders and improve the quality of the therapy. Moreover, our research suggests that issues concerning the appearance of the robot need to be adequately dealt with by the researchers and therapists. For instance, our survey suggests that zoomorphic robots may be less problematic than robots that look too much like humans.",4
1067,Live human-robot interactive public demonstrations with automatic emotion and personality prediction,"Communication with humans is a multi-faceted phenomenon where the emotions, personality and non-verbal behaviours, as well as the verbal behaviours, play a significant role, and human-robot interaction (HRI) technologies should respect this complexity to achieve efficient and seamless communication. In this paper, we describe the design and execution of five public demonstrations made with two HRI systems that aimed at automatically sensing and analysing human participants' non-verbal behaviour and predicting their facial action units, facial expressions and personality in real time while they interacted with a small humanoid robot. We describe an overview of the challenges faced together with the lessons learned from those demonstrations in order to better inform the science and engineering fields to design and build better robots with more purposeful interaction capabilities.

1068,The robotic Trunk-Support-Trainer (TruST) to measure and increase postural workspace during sitting in people with spinal cord injury,"Study design:
        
      
      Cross-sectional study.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To measure and expand the sitting workspace of participants with spinal cord injury (SCI) with the Trunk-Support-Trainer (TruST).
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Columbia University.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      TruST is a motorized-cable belt placed around the torso. Participants performed maximal trunk excursions along eight directions, radiating in a star-shape, to define their seated postural limits and workspace area (cm2). TruST was configured to apply ""assist-as-needed"" forces when the trunk moved beyond these postural limits. Kinematics were collected to examine trunk control. The clinical features of the sample (n = 5) were documented by neurological injury, dynamometry, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, and Spinal Cord Independence Measure-III.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Statistical significance was examined with paired t-tests. TruST successfully recreated the postural limits of participants and expanded their active sitting workspace (Mean: 123.3 ± SE: 42.8 cm2, p < 0.05). Furthermore, participants improved their trunk excursions to posterior (Mean: 5.1 ± SE: 0.8 cm, p < 0.01), right (Mean: 3.1 ± SE: 1.1 cm, p < 0.05), and left (Mean: 5.0 ± SE: 1.7 cm, p = 0.05) directions with TruST-force field.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      TruST can accurately define and expand the active seated workspace of people with SCI during volitional trunk movements. The capacity of TruST to deliver continuous force-feedback at the user's postural limits opens new frontiers to implement motor learning-based paradigms to retrain functional sitting in people with SCI.",0
1069,The role of the bedside assistant in robot-assisted surgery: A critical synthesis,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robot-assisted surgery has grown exponentially since its inception and first approval in the United States in the year 2000. The surgeon operating with the assistance of the robot sits remotely to the patient and another practitioner assists at the bedside. The role of the bedside assistant and the training that is required to undertake this role are understudied topics.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To explore the functions, training and professional development of the bedside assistant in robot-assisted surgery and propose the necessary foundations for the safe enactment of the role in the United Kingdom.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Through critical interpretative synthesis, relevant literature was systematically searched and analysed to inform integration of evidence.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Seventy-three studies were retrieved from the literature, across several health care disciplines and surgical specialities. These were critically analysed to inform a theoretically sound account grounded on evidence.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The role, functions and skills of the bedside assistant in robot-assisted surgery vary across contexts. These were analysed and critically synthetised to produce several keys to the success of bedside assistants in robot-assisted surgery in the context of the United Kingdom and of its national regulations.",1
1070,Feasibility study of a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of using a humanoid robot to improve the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (Kaspar RCT): a study protocol,"Introduction:
        
      
      Interventions using robot-assisted therapy may be beneficial for the social skills development of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. The present research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a social skills intervention using Kinesics and Synchronisation in Personal Assistant Robotics (Kaspar) with children with ASD.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      Forty children will be recruited. Inclusion criteria are the following: aged 5-10 years, confirmed ASD diagnosis, IQ over 70, English-language comprehension, a carer who can complete questionnaires in English and no current participation in a private social communication intervention. Children will be randomised to receive an intervention with a therapist and Kaspar, or with the therapist only. They will receive two familiarisation sessions and six treatment sessions for 8 weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, and at 10 and 22 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate whether the predetermined feasibility criteria for a full-scale trial are met. The potential primary outcome measures for a full-scale trial are the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Skills Improvement System. We will conduct a preliminary economic analysis. After the study has ended, a sample of 20 participants and their families will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the study's methods and intervention.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      Parents/carers will provide informed consent, and children will give assent, where appropriate. Care will be taken to avoid pressure or coercion to participate. Aftercare is available from the recruiting NHS Trust, and a phased withdrawal protocol will be followed if children become excessively attached to the robot. The results of the study will be disseminated to academic audiences and non-academic stakeholders, for example, families of children with ASD, support groups, clinicians and charities.

1071,Human-robot interaction: the impact of robotic aesthetics on anticipated human trust,"Background:
        
      
      Human senses have evolved to recognise sensory cues. Beyond our perception, they play an integral role in our emotional processing, learning, and interpretation. They are what help us to sculpt our everyday experiences and can be triggered by aesthetics to form the foundations of our interactions with each other and our surroundings. In terms of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots have the possibility to interact with both people and environments given their senses. They can offer the attributes of human characteristics, which in turn can make the interchange with technology a more appealing and admissible experience. However, for many reasons, people still do not seem to trust and accept robots. Trust is expressed as a person's ability to accept the potential risks associated with participating alongside an entity such as a robot. Whilst trust is an important factor in building relationships with robots, the presence of uncertainties can add an additional dimension to the decision to trust a robot. In order to begin to understand how to build trust with robots and reverse the negative ideology, this paper examines the influences of aesthetic design techniques on the human ability to trust robots.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This paper explores the potential that robots have unique opportunities to improve their facilities for empathy, emotion, and social awareness beyond their more cognitive functionalities. Through conducting an online questionnaire distributed globally, we explored participants ability and acceptance in trusting the Canbot U03 robot. Participants were presented with a range of visual questions which manipulated the robot's facial screen and asked whether or not they would trust the robot. A selection of questions aimed at putting participants in situations where they were required to establish whether or not to trust a robot's responses based solely on the visual appearance. We accomplished this by manipulating different design elements of the robots facial and chest screens, which influenced the human-robot interaction.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found that certain facial aesthetics seem to be more trustworthy than others, such as a cartoon face versus a human face, and that certain visual variables (i.e., blur) afforded uncertainty more than others. Consequentially, this paper reports that participant's uncertainties of the visualisations greatly influenced their willingness to accept and trust the robot. The results of introducing certain anthropomorphic characteristics emphasised the participants embrace of the uncanny valley theory, where pushing the degree of human likeness introduced a thin line between participants accepting robots and not. By understanding what manipulation of design elements created the aesthetic effect that triggered the affective processes, this paper further enriches our knowledge of how we might design for certain emotions, feelings, and ultimately more socially acceptable and trusting robotic experiences.",4
1072,Evolving Trust in Robots: Specification Through Sequential and Comparative Meta-Analyses,"Objective:
        
      
      The objectives of this meta-analysis are to explore the presently available empirical findings on the antecedents of trust in robots and use this information to expand upon a previous meta-analytic review of the area.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Human-robot interaction (HRI) represents an increasingly important dimension of our everyday existence. Currently, the most important element of these interactions is proposed to be whether the human trusts the robot or not. We have identified three overarching categories that exert effects on the expression of trust. These consist of factors associated with (a) the human, (b) the robot, and (c) the context in which any specific HRI event occurs.
    


          Method:
        
      
      The current body of literature was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to trust in robots were included in the meta-analysis. A previous meta-analysis on HRI trust was used as the basis for this extended, updated, and evolving analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Multiple additional factors, which have now been demonstrated to significantly influence trust, were identified. The present results, expressed as points of difference and points of commonality between the current and previous analyses, are identified, explained, and cast in the setting of the emerging wave of HRI.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The present meta-analysis expands upon previous work and validates the overarching categories of trust antecedent (human-related, robot-related, and contextual), as well as identifying the significant individual precursors to trust within each category. A new and updated model of these complex interactions is offered.

      One area where telemedicine may prove to be highly effective is in providing medical care to the geriatric population, an age group predicted to account for 20% of the population in the near future. However, even though telemedicine has certain advantages, the usability of these systems with this population merits investigation.

Of these, 60% of the studies focused on the overall usability of telemedicine systems; 6.25% focused on the usability of a telepresence robot; 12.5% compared a face-to-face medical consultation with the use of telemedicine systems, and 25% focused on the study of other aspects of telemedicine in addition to its usability. Findings reported in the studies included high patient satisfaction with telemedicine in 31.25%, whereas another 31.25% indicated a high acceptance of this method of medical consultation. Care coordination in 6.25% of the studies; confidence in telemedicine in 6.25%; trust, privacy, and reliability in 6.25%; and increased convenience when compared to personal visits in 18.75% were also reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This review suggests limited research providing scientifically valid and reproducible usability evaluation at various stages of telemedicine system development. Telemedicine system designers need to consider the age-related issues in cognition, perception, and behavior of geriatric patients while designing telemedicine applications. Future directions for research were developed based on the limitations as well as other results found in this systematic review.",1
1074,Neural Mechanisms for Accepting and Rejecting Artificial Social Partners in the Uncanny Valley,"Artificial agents are becoming prevalent across human life domains. However, the neural mechanisms underlying human responses to these new, artificial social partners remain unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis predicts that humans prefer anthropomorphic agents but reject them if they become too humanlike-the so-called UV reaction. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated artificial agents and made decisions about them. Across two experimental tasks, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions. Specifically, VMPFC signaled the subjective likability of artificial agents as a nonlinear function of humanlikeness, with selective low likability for highly humanlike agents. In exploratory across-subject analyses, these effects explained individual differences in psychophysical evaluations and preference choices. Functionally connected areas encoded critical inputs for these signals: the temporoparietal junction encoded a linear humanlikeness continuum, whereas nonlinear representations of humanlikeness in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and fusiform gyrus emphasized a human-nonhuman distinction. Following principles of multisensory integration, multiplicative combination of these signals reconstructed VMPFC's valuation function. During decision making, separate signals in VMPFC and DMPFC encoded subjects' decision variable for choices involving humans or artificial agents, respectively. A distinct amygdala signal predicted rejection of artificial agents. Our data suggest that human reactions toward artificial agents are governed by a neural mechanism that generates a selective, nonlinear valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). Thus, a basic principle known from sensory coding-neural feature selectivity from linear-nonlinear transformation-may also underlie human responses to artificial social partners.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Would you trust a robot to make decisions for you? Autonomous artificial agents are increasingly entering our lives, but how the human brain responds to these new artificial social partners remains unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis-an influential psychological framework-captures the observation that human responses to artificial agents are nonlinear: we like increasingly anthropomorphic artificial agents, but feel uncomfortable if they become too humanlike. Here we investigated neural activity when humans evaluated artificial agents and made personal decisions about them. Our findings suggest a novel neurobiological conceptualization of human responses toward artificial agents: the UV reaction-a selective dislike of highly humanlike agents-is based on nonlinear value-coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a key component of the brain's reward system.",4
1075,Current Use of and Indications for Robot-assisted Surgery in Paediatric Urology,"The use of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) by paediatric urologists is increasing. This mini review looks at the current status of RAS in paediatric urology. The challenges involved in RAS use in children are reviewed, as well as the indications for and feasibility of procedures performed and, where possible, outcomes with RAS. PATIENT SUMMARY: The current status of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) in paediatric urology, together with the challenges in using RAS for children is outlined in this mini review. Innovative adaptation has pushed the boundaries as regards the feasibility of RAS procedures in children with good outcomes.",3
1076,Retroperitoneal Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy in Obese Patients,"Objectives: To report our experience with retroperitoneal robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in obese patients. Patients and Methods: From April 2012 to December 2018, 127 patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 underwent RAPN, of whom 110 patients had retroperitoneal RAPN. We reviewed the patients' demographic, operative data, perioperative and postoperative complications, and postoperative histology. Results: The median BMI was 33.1 kg/m2 (interquartile range [IQR] 31.5-36.6). The median age of the patients was 59 years. The mean histological size of tumor was 32.2 mm (IQR 23.8-40). The median total surgical time was 130 minutes (IQR 110-176) with a median warm ischemia time of 22.0 minutes. The tumor was located anteriorly in 25% of the cases. The median R.E.N.A.L.* nephrometry score was 6. The median estimated blood loss was 30 mL (IQR 10-80). Three cases were converted to open partial nephrectomy because of bleeding (2.7%). Four patients and one patient returned within 30 days with postoperative complications Clavien-Dindo classification grade 2 and 3a, respectively. Two patients needed perioperative blood transfusion because of bleeding. The median length of stay was 1 day (IQR 1-2). Conclusion: Retroperitoneal RAPN is feasible in patients with high BMI and provides good surgical access to treat nonanterior renal masses. Retroperitoneal RAPN is associated with less blood loss, shorter surgical time, and warm ischemia time when compared with transperitoneal RAPN studies.",9
1077,Economic evaluation of robot-assisted training versus an enhanced upper limb therapy programme or usual care for patients with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation due to stroke: results from the RATULS randomised controlled trial,"Objective:
        
      
      To determine whether robot-assisted training is cost-effective compared with an enhanced upper limb therapy (EULT) programme or usual care.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Economic evaluation within a randomised controlled trial.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Four National Health Service (NHS) centres in the UK: Queen's Hospital, Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust; Northwick Park Hospital, London Northwest Healthcare NHS Trust; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; and North Tyneside General Hospital, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      770 participants aged 18 years or older with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation from first-ever stroke.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Participants randomised to one of three programmes provided over a 12-week period: robot-assisted training plus usual care; the EULT programme plus usual care or usual care.
    


          Main economic outcome measures:
        
      
      Mean healthcare resource use; costs to the NHS and personal social services in 2018 pounds; utility scores based on EQ-5D-5L responses and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness reported as incremental cost per QALY and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At 6 months, on average usual care was the least costly option (£3785) followed by EULT (£4451) with robot-assisted training being the most costly (£5387). The mean difference in total costs between the usual care and robot-assisted training groups (£1601) was statistically significant (p<0.001). Mean QALYs were highest for the EULT group (0.23) but no evidence of a difference (p=0.995) was observed between the robot-assisted training (0.21) and usual care groups (0.21). The incremental cost per QALY at 6 months for participants randomised to EULT compared with usual care was £74 100. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that robot-assisted training was unlikely to be cost-effective and that EULT had a 19% chance of being cost-effective at the £20 000 willingness to pay (WTP) threshold. Usual care was most likely to be cost-effective at all the WTP values considered in the analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that neither robot-assisted training nor EULT, as delivered in this trial, were likely to be cost-effective at any of the cost per QALY thresholds considered.

1078,Factors supporting and constraining the implementation of robot-assisted surgery: a realist interview study,"Objective:
        
      
      To capture stakeholders' theories concerning how and in what contexts robot-assisted surgery becomes integrated into routine practice.
    


          Design:
        
      
      A literature review provided tentative theories that were revised through a realist interview study. Literature-based theories were presented to the interviewees, who were asked to describe to what extent and in what ways those theories reflected their experience. Analysis focused on identifying mechanisms through which robot-assisted surgery becomes integrated into practice and contexts in which those mechanisms are triggered.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      Nine hospitals in England where robot-assisted surgery is used for colorectal operations.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Forty-four theatre staff with experience of robot-assisted colorectal surgery, including surgeons, surgical trainees, theatre nurses, operating department practitioners and anaesthetists.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Interviewees emphasised the importance of support from hospital management, team leaders and surgical colleagues. Training together as a team was seen as beneficial, increasing trust in each other's knowledge and supporting team bonding, in turn leading to improved teamwork. When first introducing robot-assisted surgery, it is beneficial to have a handpicked dedicated robotic team who are able to quickly gain experience and confidence. A suitably sized operating theatre can reduce operation duration and the risk of de-sterilisation. Motivation among team members to persist with robot-assisted surgery can be achieved without involvement in the initial decision to purchase a robot, but training that enables team members to feel confident as they take on the new tasks is essential.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We captured accounts of how robot-assisted surgery has been introduced into a range of hospitals. Using a realist approach, we were also able to capture perceptions of the factors that support and constrain the integration of robot-assisted surgery into routine practice. We have translated these into recommendations that can inform future implementations of robot-assisted surgery.",3
1079,Outcomes of Robot-assisted Partial Nephrectomy for Clinical T3a Renal Masses: A Multicenter Analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Use of partial nephrectomy (PN) in T3 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is controversial.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate quality outcomes of robot-assisted PN (RAPN) for clinical T3a renal masses (cT3aRM).
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      This was a retrospective multicenter analysis of patients with cT3aN0M0 RCC who underwent RAPN.
    


          Intervention:
        
      
      RAPN.
    


          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:
        
      
      The primary endpoint was a trifecta composite outcome of negative surgical margins, warm ischemia time (WIT) ≤25 min, and no perioperative complications. The optimal outcome was defined as achieving this trifecta and ≥90% preservation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and no stage upgrading of chronic kidney disease. Multivariable analysis (MVA) identified risk factors associated with lack of the optimal outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted for survival outcomes.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Analysis was conducted for 157 patients (median follow-up 26 mo). The median tumor size was 7.0 cm (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0-7.8) and the median RENAL score was 9 (IQR 8-10). Median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 242 ml (IQR 121-354) and the median WIT was 19 min (IQR 15-25). A total of 150 patients (95.5%) had negative margins. Complications were noted in 25 patients (15.9%), with 4.5% having Clavien grade 3-5 complications. The median change in eGFR was 7 ml/min/1.72 m2, with ≥90% eGFR preservation in 55.4%. The trifecta outcome was achieved for 64.3% and the optimal outcome for 37.6% of the patients. MVA revealed that greater age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; p = 0.002), increasing RENAL score (OR 1.30; p = 0.035), and EBL >300 ml (OR 5.96, p = 0.006) were predictive of failure to achieve optimal outcome. The 5-yr recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival, were 82.1%, 93.3%, and 91.3%, respectively. Limitations include the retrospective design.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      RAPN for select cT3a renal masses is feasible and safe, with acceptable quality outcomes. Further investigation is requisite to delineate the role of RAPN in cT3a RCC.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy in patients with stage 3a kidney cancer provided acceptable survival, functional, and morbidity outcomes in the hands of experienced surgeons, and may be considered as an option when clinically indicated.",9
1080,Artificial intelligence and surgical innovation: lower limb arthroplasty,"The number of patients requiring hip and knee arthroplasty continues to rise each year. Patients are living longer and expecting to remain active into later life following joint replacement. Developments in computer-assisted surgery and robotic technology may optimise surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction following lower limb arthroplasty. The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare is rapidly growing and has gained momentum in lower limb arthroplasty.

1081,Transoral Robotic Surgery for Residual and Recurrent Oropharyngeal Cancers,"Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a well-established treatment option for treatment-naïve oropharyngeal cancer. For residual, recurrent, and new primary oropharyngeal tumors emerging in previously irradiated fields, the global experience of management with TORS is limited. This article discusses current concepts on this topic, offers a deeper insight into the transoral anatomy for these cases, and covers the specific complexities of resections in the various subsites of the oropharynx. It provides practical tips on reconstruction, recovery, and rehabilitation as well as offering a synthesis of the current evidence and exploring future trends.",1
1082,"Safe transition from extracorporeal to intracorporeal urinary diversion following robot-assisted cystectomy: a recipe for reducing operative time, blood loss and complication rates","Purpose:
        
      
      We report the perioperative outcomes and complications after transition from extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) to intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) following robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Analysis of data from a prospectively maintained institutional review board-approved database of 180 patients treated with cystectomy at our institution from April 2015 to October 2017 was performed. 127 patients underwent RARC and received an ileal conduit. Only five patients received a neobladder after RARC and were excluded from analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      68 patients had extracorporeal and 59 intracorporeal ileal conduit after RARC. There were no significant differences in patient demographics and oncological characteristics between the two groups. Of note, intracorporeal ileal conduit was associated with significantly reduced median total operative times (330 vs 375 min, p = 0.019), reduced median estimated blood loss (300 vs 425 ml, p < 0.035) and lower 30-day overall complication rates (48.4 vs 71.4%, p = 0.008) when compared to extracorporeal diversion. However, the median length of stay, 30-90-day complication rates, mortality rates and ureteroileal anastomotic stricture rates were similar in both groups. The median operative time for RARC and intracorporeal ileal conduit was significantly shorter in the second cohort of 29 cases compared to the first 30 cases (300 vs 360 min, p = 0.004). Other outcomes were similar in both cohorts.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In our experience, transition from extracorporeal to intracorporeal diversion after RARC is safe, technically feasible and benefits from shorter operative times, reduced estimated blood loss, and lower 30-day overall complication rates.",2
1083,Robot teachers for children? Young children trust robots depending on their perceived accuracy and agency,"Children acquire extensive knowledge from others. Today, children receive information from not only people but also technological devices, like social robots. Two studies assessed whether young children appropriately trust technological informants. One hundred and four 3-year-olds learned the names of novel objects from either a pair of social robots or inanimate machines, where 1 informant was previously shown to be accurate and the other inaccurate. Children trusted information from an accurate social robot over an inaccurate one, as they have been shown to do for human informants, and even more so when they perceived the robots as having psychological agency. However, children did not learn selectively from inanimate, but accurate, machines. Children can learn from technological devices (e.g., social robots) but trust their information more when the device appears to have mindful agency.

1084,Effects of Robot Facial Characteristics and Gender in Persuasive Human-Robot Interaction,"The growing interest in social robotics makes it relevant to examine the potential of robots as persuasive agents and, more specifically, to examine how robot characteristics influence the way people experience such interactions and comply with the persuasive attempts by robots. The purpose of this research is to identify how the (ostensible) gender and the facial characteristics of a robot influence the extent to which people trust it and the psychological reactance they experience from its persuasive attempts. This paper reports a laboratory study where SociBot™, a robot capable of displaying different faces and dynamic social cues, delivered persuasive messages to participants while playing a game. In-game choice behavior was logged, and trust and reactance toward the advisor were measured using questionnaires. Results show that a robotic advisor with upturned eyebrows and lips (features that people tend to trust more in humans) is more persuasive, evokes more trust, and less psychological reactance compared to one displaying eyebrows pointing down and lips curled downwards at the edges (facial characteristics typically not trusted in humans). Gender of the robot did not affect trust, but participants experienced higher psychological reactance when interacting with a robot of the opposite gender. Remarkably, mediation analysis showed that liking of the robot fully mediates the influence of facial characteristics on trusting beliefs and psychological reactance. Also, psychological reactance was a strong and reliable predictor of trusting beliefs but not of trusting behavior. These results suggest robots that are intended to influence human behavior should be designed to have facial characteristics we trust in humans and could be personalized to have the same gender as the user. Furthermore, personalization and adaptation techniques designed to make people like the robot more may help ensure they will also trust the robot.",4
1085,"Can Robots Earn Our Trust the Same Way Humans Do? A Systematic Exploration of Competence, Warmth, and Anthropomorphism as Determinants of Trust Development in HRI","Robots increasingly act as our social counterparts in domains such as healthcare and retail. For these human-robot interactions (HRI) to be effective, a question arises on whether we trust robots the same way we trust humans. We investigated whether the determinants competence and warmth, known to influence interpersonal trust development, influence trust development in HRI, and what role anthropomorphism plays in this interrelation. In two online studies with 2 × 2 between-subjects design, we investigated the role of robot competence (Study 1) and robot warmth (Study 2) in trust development in HRI. Each study explored the role of robot anthropomorphism in the respective interrelation. Videos showing an HRI were used for manipulations of robot competence (through varying gameplay competence) and robot anthropomorphism (through verbal and non-verbal design cues and the robot's presentation within the study introduction) in Study 1 (n = 155) as well as robot warmth (through varying compatibility of intentions with the human player) and robot anthropomorphism (same as Study 1) in Study 2 (n = 157). Results show a positive effect of robot competence (Study 1) and robot warmth (Study 2) on trust development in robots regarding anticipated trust and attributed trustworthiness. Subjective perceptions of competence (Study 1) and warmth (Study 2) mediated the interrelations in question. Considering applied manipulations, robot anthropomorphism neither moderated interrelations of robot competence and trust (Study 1) nor robot warmth and trust (Study 2). Considering subjective perceptions, perceived anthropomorphism moderated the effect of perceived competence (Study 1) and perceived warmth (Study 2) on trust on an attributional level. Overall results support the importance of robot competence and warmth for trust development in HRI and imply transferability regarding determinants of trust development in interpersonal interaction to HRI. Results indicate a possible role of perceived anthropomorphism in these interrelations and support a combined consideration of these variables in future studies. Insights deepen the understanding of key variables and their interaction in trust dynamics in HRI and suggest possibly relevant design factors to enable appropriate trust levels and a resulting desirable HRI. Methodological and conceptual limitations underline benefits of a rather robot-specific approach for future research.",4
1086,Trust in socially assistive robots: Considerations for use in rehabilitation,"Incorporation of social robots into rehabilitation calls for understanding what factors affect user motivation and success of the interaction. Trust between the user and the robot has been identified as important in human-robot interaction and in human-human interactions in therapy. Trust has been studied in the context of automation technology, (e.g., autonomous cars), but not in the context of social robots for rehabilitation. In this narrative review, we address the unique patient-clinician-robot triad, and argue that this context calls for specific design features in order to foster trust with the users. We review pertinent methods for measuring trust, and studies demonstrating that culture, prior experience and propensity-to-trust affect to what extent users trust robots. We suggest design guidelines for fostering trust and methods for measuring trust in human-robot interactions in rehabilitation. We stress the need to create measures of trust that are accessible to people who suffer from speech or cognitive impairments. This review is pertinent to researchers, roboticists, and clinicians interested in designing and using social robots for rehabilitation.",4
1087,Differential biases in human-human versus human-robot interactions,"The research on human-robot interactions indicates possible differences toward robot trust that do not exist in human-human interactions. Research on these differences has traditionally focused on performance degradations. The current study sought to explore differences in human-robot and human-human trust interactions with performance, consideration, and morality trustworthiness manipulations, which are based on ability/performance, benevolence/purpose, and integrity/process manipulations, respectively, from previous research. We used a mixed factorial hierarchical linear model design to explore the effects of trustworthiness manipulations on trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors in a trust game. We found partner (human versus robot) differences across all three trustworthiness perceptions, indicating biases towards robots may be more expansive than previously thought. Additionally, there were marginal effects of partner differences on trust intentions. Interestingly, there were no differences between partners on trust behaviors. Results indicate human biases toward robots may be more complex than considered in the literature.",2
1088,Trust Toward Robots and Artificial Intelligence: An Experimental Approach to Human-Technology Interactions Online,"Robotization and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to change societies profoundly. Trust is an important factor of human-technology interactions, as robots and AI increasingly contribute to tasks previously handled by humans. Currently, there is a need for studies investigating trust toward AI and robots, especially in first-encounter meetings. This article reports findings from a study investigating trust toward robots and AI in an online trust game experiment. The trust game manipulated the hypothetical opponents that were described as either AI or robots. These were compared with control group opponents using only a human name or a nickname. Participants (N = 1077) lived in the United States. Describing opponents with robots or AI did not impact participants' trust toward them. The robot called jdrx894 was the most trusted opponent. Opponents named ""jdrx894"" were trusted more than opponents called ""Michael."" Further analysis showed that having a degree in technology or engineering, exposure to robots online and robot use self-efficacy predicted higher trust toward robots and AI. Out of Big Five personality characteristics, openness to experience predicted higher trust, and conscientiousness predicted lower trust. Results suggest trust on robots and AI is contextual and it is also dependent on individual differences and knowledge on technology.",4

1091,What about the human in human robot collaboration?,"In this review we address the human in human robot collaboration (HRC). Although there are different hypotheses on potential effects of HRC on job quality, defined as the quality of the working environment and its effect on the employee's well-being, a comprehensive theory is still lacking. How does HRC influence job quality on an individual level and how can we adapt HRC to boost positivity at work? We identified four job quality related factors that are of relevance in HRC: (1) Cognitive Workload, (2) Collaboration Fluency, (3) Trust, and (4) Acceptance and Satisfaction. Increasing awareness and being able to adapt the robot to the individual operator are crucial to improve the aforementioned factors. Implementing predictable robots, that offer a clear advantage to the human and take into account operators' preferences, will bring us closer to a human-centered collaboration. Practitioner Summary: The effect of human robot collaboration (HRC) on job quality is still under debate. Design characteristics of HRC, such as collaboration design, robot design, and workplace design affect job quality related factors. Using a participatory design approach, as to align robot capabilities to end-users' preferences, will enhance HRC and improve job quality.

1092,Assessment of Out-of-Pocket Costs for Robotic Cancer Surgery in US Adults,"Importance:
        
      
      Expensive technologies-including robotic surgery-experience rapid adoption without evidence of superior outcomes. Although previous studies have examined perioperative outcomes and costs, differences in out-of-pocket costs for patients undergoing robotic surgery are not well understood.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess out-of-pocket costs and total payments for 5 types of common oncologic procedures that can be performed using an open or robotic approach.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      A retrospective, cross-sectional, propensity score-weighted analysis was performed using deidentified insurance claims for 1.9 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. The final study sample comprised 15 893 US adults aged 18 to 64 years who were enrolled in an employer-sponsored health plan. Patients underwent either an open or robotic radical prostatectomy, hysterectomy, partial colectomy, radical nephrectomy, or partial nephrectomy for a solid-organ malignant neoplasm. Statistical analysis was performed from December 18, 2018, to June 5, 2019.
    


          Exposures:

          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome of interest was out-of-pocket costs associated with robotic and open surgery. The secondary outcome of interest was associated total payments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 15 893 patients (11 102 men; mean [SD] age, 55.4 [6.6] years), 8260 underwent robotic and 7633 underwent open procedures; patients undergoing robotic hysterectomy were older than those undergoing open hysterectomy (mean [SD] age, 55.7 [6.7] vs 54.6 [7.2] years), and patients undergoing open radical nephrectomy had more comorbidities than those undergoing robotic radical nephrectomy (≥2 comorbidities, 658 of 861 [76.4%] vs 244 of 347 [70.3%]). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the robotic approach was associated with lower out-of-pocket costs for all procedures: -$137.75 (95% CI, -$240.24 to -$38.63) for radical prostatectomy (P = .006); -$640.63 (95% CI, -$933.62 to -$368.79) for hysterectomy (P < .001); -$1140.54 (95% CI, -$1397.79 to -$896.54) for partial colectomy (P < .001); -$728.32 (95% CI, -$1126.90 to -$366.08) for radical nephrectomy (P < .001); and -$302.74 (95% CI, -$523.14 to -$97.10) for partial nephrectomy (P = .003). The robotic approach was similarly associated with lower adjusted total payments: -$3872.62 (95% CI, -$5385.49 to -$2399.04) for radical prostatectomy (P < .001); -$29 640.69 (95% CI, -$36 243.82 to -$23 465.94) for hysterectomy (P < .001); -$38 151.74 (95% CI, -$46 386.16 to -$30 346.22) for partial colectomy; (P < .001); -$33 394.15 (95% CI, -$42 603.03 to -$24 955.20) for radical nephrectomy (P < .001); and -$9162.52 (95% CI, -$12 728.33 to -$5781.99) for partial nephrectomy (P < .001).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      This study found significant variation in perioperative costs according to surgical technique for both patients (out-of-pocket costs) and payers (total payments); the robotic approach was associated with lower out-of-pocket costs for all studied oncologic procedures.",5
1093,PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores correlate with perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: analysis of the Vattikuti Global Quality Initiative in Robotic Urologic Surgery (GQI-RUS) database,"Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate and compare the correlations between Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for an Anatomical (PADUA) and R.E.N.A.L. [Radius (tumour size as maximal diameter), Exophytic/endophytic properties of the tumour, Nearness of tumour deepest portion to the collecting system or sinus, Anterior (a)/posterior (p) descriptor and the Location relative to the polar line] nephrometry scores and perioperative outcomes and postoperative complications in a multicentre, international series of patients undergoing robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for masses suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively evaluated the clinical records of patients who underwent RAPN between 2010 and 2013 for clinical N0M0 renal tumours in four international centres that completed all the data required for the Vattikuti Global Quality Initiative in Robotic Urologic Surgery (GQI-RUS) database. All patients underwent preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to define the clinical stage and anatomical characteristics of the tumours. PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. scores were retrospectively assessed in each centre. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the correlations between age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, clinical tumour size, PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. complexity group categories and warm ischaemia time (WIT) of >20 min, urinary calyceal system closure, and grade of postoperative complications.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 277 patients were evaluated. The median (interquartile range) tumour size was 33.0 (22.0-43.0) mm. The median PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. scores were eight and seven, respectively; 112 (40.4%), 86 (31.0%) and 79 (28.5%) patients were classified in the low-, intermediate- or high-complexity group according to PADUA score, while 118 (42.5%), 139 (50.1%) and 20 (7.2%) were classified in the low-, intermediate- or high-complexity group according to R.E.N.A.L. score, respectively. Both nephrometry tools significantly correlated with perioperative outcomes at univariate and multivariate analyses.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A precise stratification of patients before PN is recommended to consider both the potential threats and benefits of nephron-sparing surgery. In our present analysis, both PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. were significantly associated with predicting prolonged WIT and high-grade postoperative complications after RAPN.",1
1094,"Perioperative outcomes and safety of robotic vs open cystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12,640 cases","Purpose:
        
      
      Robotic radical cystectomy (RRC) has become a commonly utilised alternative to open radical cystectomy (ORC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RRC vs ORC focusing on perioperative outcomes and safety.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medline, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched from January 2000 to April 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Statement for study selection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 47 studies (5 randomised controlled trials, 42 non-randomised comparative studies) comprising 12,640 patients (6572 ORC, 6068 RRC) were included. There was no difference in baseline demographics between the groups apart from males were more likely to undergo ORC (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85). Those with muscle-invasive disease were more likely to undergo RRC (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.34), and those with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer were more likely to undergo ORC (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.89). RRC had a significantly longer operating time, less blood loss and lower transfusion rate. There was no difference in lymph node yield, rate of positive surgical margins, or Clavien-Dindo Grade I-II complications between the two groups. However, the RRC group were less likely to experience Clavien-Dindo Grade III-IV (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30-1.89) and overall complications (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.26-1.68) than the ORC group. The mortality rate was higher in ORC although this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.99-2.35).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RRC has significantly lower blood loss, transfusion rate and is associated with fewer high grade and overall complications compared to ORC.",2
1095,A systematic review and network meta-analysis of different surgical approaches for pancreaticoduodenectomy,"Background:
        
      
      Minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD) is a demanding surgical procedure, thus explaining its slow expansion and limited popularity amongst Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary (HPB) surgeons. However, three main advantages of robotic assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) including improved dexterity, 3D vision less surgical fatigue, may overcome some of the hurdles and ultimately lead to a wider adoption. This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to evaluate the current literature on open and MIPD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted for studies reporting robotic, laparoscopic and open surgery for PD. Network meta-analysis of intraoperative (operating time, blood loss, transfusion rate), postoperative (overall and major complications, pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, length of hospital stay) and oncological outcomes (R0 resection, lymphadenectomy) were performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Sixty-one studies including 62,529 patients were included in the network meta-analysis, of which 3% (n = 2131) were totally robotic (TR) and 10% (n = 6514) were totally laparoscopic (TL). There were no significant differences between surgical techniques for major complications, overall and grade B/C fistula, biliary leak, mortality and R0 resections. Transfusion rates were significantly lower in TR compared to TL and open. Operative time for TR was longer compared with open and TL. Both TL and TR were associated with significantly lower rates of wound infections, pulmonary complications, shorter length of stay and higher lymph nodes examined when compared to open. TR was associated with significantly lower conversion rates than TL.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In summary, this network meta-analysis highlights the variability in techniques within MIPD and compares other variations to the conventional open PD. Current evidence appears to demonstrate MIPD, both laparoscopic and robotic techniques are associated with improved rates of surgical site infections, pulmonary complications, and a shorter hospital stay, with no compromise in oncological outcomes for cancer resections.",9
1096,Use of the self-retaining Alexis ring retractor in transoral robotic surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Ring retractors, such as the Alexis® wound retractor, are simple devices used in a wide range of surgical settings to provide atraumatic exposure while protecting wound edges.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Here, we describe the application of the Alexis® to provide access during transoral robotic surgery (TORS).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Its ease of application and many benefits, including maximization of intraoral space and protection of perioral soft tissues, make this device an excellent adjunct for TORS procedures.",1
1097,Trust in artificial intelligence within production management - an exploration of antecedents,"Industry 4.0, big data, predictive analytics, and robotics are leading to a paradigm shift on the shop floor of industrial production. However, complex, cognitive tasks are also subject of change, due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Smart assistants are finding their way into the world of knowledge work and require cooperation with humans. Here, trust is an essential factor that determines the success of human-AI cooperation. Within this article, an analysis within production management identifies possible antecedent variables on trust in AI and evaluates these due to interaction scenarios with AI. The results of this research are five antecedents for human trust in AI within production management. From these results, preliminary design guidelines are derived for a socially sustainable human-AI interaction in future production management systems. Practitioner summary: In the future, artificial intelligence will assist cognitive tasks in production management. In order to make good decisions, humans trust in AI has to be well calibrated. For trustful human-AI interactions, it is beneficial that humans subjectively perceive AI as capable and comprehensible and that they themselves are digitally competent.",4
1098,Robot-assisted kidney transplantation: update from the European Robotic Urology Section (ERUS) series,"Objective:
        
      
      To report the results of the robot-assisted kidney transplantation (RAKT) experience performed in 10 European centres by members of the European Robotic Urology Section (ERUS)-RAKT group.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      This is a multicentre prospective observational study of RAKT. Descriptive analysis of recipients and donor characteristics, surgical data, intraoperative outcomes, complications rate and functional results were collected and analysed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Between July 2015 and September 2019, 291 living-donor RAKTs were performed. Recipients were mostly male (189 [65%]), the mean Standard deviation (sd) age was 45.2 (13.35) years, the mean (sd) body mass index was 27.13 (19.28) kg/m2 , and RAKT was pre-emptive in 155 (53.8%) cases. Right and multiple arteries kidneys were used in 15.4%. The mean (sd) total surgical and re-warming time was 244 (70.5) min and 53.16 (15.27) min, respectively. In all, 17 patients presented with postoperative bleeding (5.7%). Five kidneys had delayed graft function; five (2%) were lost due to thrombosis and one due to acute rejection. Two patients had arterial stenosis, three had incisional hernias, six had ureteric stenosis, and nine had lymphoceles. Neither surgical nor re-warming times were correlated with postoperative serum creatinine levels (P > 0.05). Comparison of surgical data between the first 120 cases and the following 171 cases showed a significantly shorter total surgical time in the second group (265 vs 230 min, P = 0.005).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the largest European multicentre study of RAKT with good surgical and functional results competitive with open kidney transplant series, with a relatively short learning curve when performed in centres with a wide experience in open kidney transplantation and robotic surgery.",9
1099,Bringing Psychological Strategies to Robot-Assisted Physiotherapy for Enhanced Treatment Efficacy,"Robotic technologies offer a range of functions to augment clinical rehabilitation practice. However, compliance with robot-assisted rehabilitation techniques has not been optimally achieved. Traditional approaches to improving the treatment efficacy are focusing more on the system function, while psychological factors have not been integrated comprehensively. In this perspective paper, eight key factors reflecting three conceptions-robot design, function design, and patients' expectations have been evaluated and analyzed. Clinical results with 28 therapists and 84 patients indicate that integrating psychological strategies into robot-assisted physiotherapy may promote better trust and acceptance of rehabilitation robots.",1
1100,Comprehensive training in robotic surgery,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      Robotic training in urology can be poorly structured, lack a basic skills foundation, and may not include teaching in important nontechnical human factor skills vital to the safe delivery of robotic care. Assessment of acquired skills is not routine. There is a need for structured and standardized curricular to deliver validated training and final assessment. The present reviews the current literature on training methods for robotic surgery, and examines the evidence for their effect on performance, where available.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      There is good evidence for the beneficial effect of dry lab simulators on robotic skills acquisition, but less for cadaveric and animal models. Two urological authorities have developed comprehensive curricula for robotic training that take a novice robotic surgeon through the full stages of robotic skills acquisition. These are in the early stages of development and validation but have stimulated the development of curricula in other specialties.
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The future landscape for robotic urology training is likely to include structured, mandated, and centralized training, possibly administered by urological organizations. There will be roles for telementoring, advanced education for robotic trainers, and regular revalidation of expert robotic surgeons.",3
1101,The future of partial nephrectomy,"Innovation in recent times has accelerated due to factors such as the globalization of communication; but there are also more barriers/safeguards in place than ever before as we strive to streamline this process. From the first planned partial nephrectomy completed in 1887, it took over a century to become recommended practice for small renal tumours. At present, identified areas for improvement/innovation are 1) to preserve renal parenchyma, 2) to optimise pre-operative eGFR and 3) to reduce global warm ischaemia time. All 3 of these, are statistically significant predictors of post-operative renal function. Urologists, have a proud history of embracing innovation & have experimented with different clamping techniques of the renal vasculature, image guidance in robotics, renal hypothermia, lasers and new robots under development. The DaVinci model may soon no longer have a monopoly on this market, as it loses its stranglehold with novel technology emerging including added features, such as haptic feedback with reduced costs. As ever, our predictions of the future may well fall wide of the mark, but in order to progress, one must open the mind to the possibilities that already exist, as evolution of existing technology often appears to be a revolution in hindsight.",0
1102,Targeting accuracy of robot-assisted deep brain stimulation surgery in childhood-onset dystonia: a single-center prospective cohort analysis of 45 consecutive cases,"Objective:
        
      
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for pediatric dystonia. The accuracy of electrode implantation is multifactorial and remains a challenge in this age group, mainly due to smaller anatomical targets in very young patients compared to adults, and also due to anatomical abnormalities frequently associated with some etiologies of dystonia. Data on the accuracy of robot-assisted DBS surgery in children are limited. The aim of the current paper was to assess the accuracy of robot-assisted implantation of DBS leads in a series of patients with childhood-onset dystonia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Forty-five children with dystonia undergoing implantation of DBS leads under general anesthesia between 2017 and 2019 were included. Robot-assisted stereotactic implantation of the DBS leads was performed. The final position of the electrodes was verified with an intraoperative 3D scanner (O-arm). Coordinates of the planned electrode target and actual electrode position were obtained and compared, looking at the radial error, depth error, absolute error, and directional error, as well as the euclidean distance. Functional assessment data prospectively collected by a multidisciplinary pediatric complex motor disorders team were analyzed with regard to motor skills, individualized goal achievement, and patients' and caregivers' expectations.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 90 DBS electrodes were implanted and 48.5% of the patients were female. The mean age was 11.0 ± 0.6 years (range 3-18 years). All patients received bilateral DBS electrodes into the globus pallidus internus. The median absolute errors in x-, y-, and z-axes were 0.85 mm (range 0.00-3.25 mm), 0.75 mm (range 0.05-2.45 mm), and 0.75 mm (range 0.00-3.50 mm), respectively. The median euclidean distance from the target to the actual electrode position was 1.69 ± 0.92 mm, and the median radial error was 1.21 ± 0.79. The robot-assisted technique was easily integrated into the authors' surgical practice, improving accuracy and efficiency, and reducing surgical time significantly along the learning curve. No major perioperative complications occurred.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robot-assisted stereotactic implantation of DBS electrodes in the pediatric age group is a safe and accurate surgical method. Greater accuracy was present in this cohort in comparison to previous studies in which conventional stereotactic frame-based techniques were used. Robotic DBS surgery and neuroradiological advances may result in further improvement in surgical targeting and, consequently, in better clinical outcome in the pediatric population.",0
1103,From Tutoring Gross Anatomy to Pancreatic Surgery Innovation,"The training for pancreatic surgery still is not conducted according to standardized protocols, and academic programs differ between countries and hospitals. Moreover, due to recent technological innovations such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, and the broader indications for complex pancreatic procedures due to the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, training is continuously redefining itself. The historical paradigm of ""see one, do one, teach one"" has been challenged and might have become obsolete. Finally, the rising number of surgical residents along with the limited time required practicing during residency might represent a major limitation to becoming an independent surgeon. Gross anatomy is a solid practice for the active learning of human anatomy during medical school. With regards to the pancreas, it offers a unique opportunity to both actively study the pancreatic gland anatomy during dissection and simulate actual surgical procedures. A critical review of the literature was conducted, aiming to assess the role of gross anatomy in surgical training and possible future perspectives.",3
1104,Robotic vs laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancers: has a paradigm change occurred? A systematic review by updated meta-analysis,"Aim:
        
      
      The debate about the oncological adequacy, safety and efficiency of robotic vs laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancers continues. Therefore, an updated, traditional and cumulative meta-analysis was performed with the aim of assessing the new evidence on this topic.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A systematic search of the literature for data pertaining to the last 25 years was performed. Fixed- and random-effects models were used to cumulatively assess the accumulation of evidence over time.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Patients with a significantly higher body mass index (BMI), tumours located approximately 1 cm further distally and more patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy were included in the robotic total mesorectal excision (RTME) cohort compared with those in the laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) cohort [RTME, mean difference (MD) = 0.22 (0.07, 0.36), P = 0.005; LTME, MD = -0.97 (-1.57, 0.36), P < 0.002; OR = 1.47 (1.11, 1.93), P = 0.006]. Significantly lower conversion rates to open surgery were observed in the RTME cohort than in the LTME cohort [OR = 0.33 (0.24, 0.46), P < 0.001]. Operative time in the LTME cohort was significantly reduced (by 50 min) compared with the RTME cohort. Subgroup analysis of the three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) challenged all the significant results of the main analysis and demonstrated nonsignificant differences between the RTME cohort and LTME cohort.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although the RTME cohort included patients with a significantly higher BMI, more distal tumours and more patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, this cohort demonstrated lower conversion rates to open surgery when compared with the LTME cohort. However, subgroup analysis of the RCTs demonstrated nonsignificant differences between the two procedures.",9
1105,Heterogeneous human-robot task allocation based on artificial trust,"Effective human-robot collaboration requires the appropriate allocation of indivisible tasks between humans and robots. A task allocation method that appropriately makes use of the unique capabilities of each agent (either a human or a robot) can improve team performance. This paper presents a novel task allocation method for heterogeneous human-robot teams based on artificial trust from a robot that can learn agent capabilities over time and allocate both existing and novel tasks. Tasks are allocated to the agent that maximizes the expected total reward. The expected total reward incorporates trust in the agent to successfully execute the task as well as the task reward and cost associated with using that agent for that task. Trust in an agent is computed from an artificial trust model, where trust is assessed along a capability dimension by comparing the belief in agent capabilities with the task requirements. An agent's capabilities are represented by a belief distribution and learned using stochastic task outcomes. Our task allocation method was simulated for a human-robot dyad. The team total reward of our artificial trust-based task allocation method outperforms other methods both when the human's capabilities are initially unknown and when the human's capabilities belief distribution has converged to the human's actual capabilities. Our task allocation method enables human-robot teams to maximize their joint performance.",4
1106,Insights into the relationship between usability and willingness to use a robot in the future workplaces: Studying the mediating role of trust and the moderating roles of age and STARA,"Background and aim:
        
      
      Human-robot collaboration is the key component of the fourth industrial revolution concept. Workers' willingness to collaborate with industrial robots is a basic requirement for an efficient and effective interaction. The roles of human-robot trust and technology affinity as mediators in the relationship between robot usability and worker willingness were analyzed in this study. As other critical variables, the mediator roles of Age and STARA were also calculated.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This study included 400 workers from a car company who interacted with industrial robots in their daily work activities. After examining the questionnaires' validity and reliability, the main variables were determined to be willingness to use robots and robot usability. AMOS software also considered human-robot trust and worker technology affinity as mediators. The bootstrapping method was used to evaluate indirect relationships. A set of goodness-of-fit indices were presented to determine the adequacy of the goodness of fit between the proposed model and the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Based on model fit indices, an overall satisfactory model fit was obtained for the direct/indirect relationship between robot usability and worker willingness to use it (with mediating role of human-robot trust). Workers' age and fear of Smart Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Algorithms (STARA) were identified as moderators in the relationship between usability and willingness.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Attention to the robot usability and the role of workers' trust in robots appears to be required to ensure workers' willingness to use robots and the success of human-robot collaboration in future workplaces. As the workers age and their fear of robots grows, usability can play a larger role in increasing their willingness to put robots to work.",4
1107,Locomotor and robotic assistive gait training for children with cerebral palsy,"Aim:
        
      
      To determine if robotic assisted gait training (RAGT) using surface muscle electrical stimulation and locomotor training enhances mobility outcomes when compared to locomotor training alone in children with cerebral palsy (CP).
    


          Method:
        
      
      Forty children (18 females, 22 males; mean age 8y 1mo, SD 2y 1mo; range 5y 1mo-12y 11mo) with CP in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels (GMFCS) III, IV, and V were randomly assigned to the RAGT and locomotor training (RAGT+LT) group or locomotor training only group (dosage for both: three 1-hour sessions a week for 6 weeks). Outcomes were assessed at baseline T1 (week 0), post-treatment T2 (week 6), and retention T3 (week 26). The primary outcome measure was the Goal Attainment Scale. Secondary outcome measures included the 10-metre walk test, children's functional independence measure mobility and self-care domain, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, and the Gross Motor Function Measure.
    


          Results:
        
      
      There were no significant differences between the groups for both the primary and secondary outcome measures. All participants completed the intervention in their original group allocation. There were no reported adverse events.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      The addition of RAGT to locomotor training does not significantly improve motor outcomes in children with CP in GMFCS levels III, IV, and V. Future studies could investigate health and well-being outcomes after locomotor training.
    


          What this paper adds:
        
      
      Marginally ambulant and non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy can participate in locomotor training. Robotic assisted gait training when added to locomotor training does not appear to be any more effective than locomotor training alone.",2
1108,A novel 3D-printed hybrid simulation model for robotic-assisted kidney transplantation (RAKT),"Robotic-assisted kidney transplantation (RAKT) offers key benefits for patients that have been demonstrated in several studies. A barrier to the wider uptake of RAKT is surgical skill acquisition. This is exacerbated by the challenges of modern surgery with reduced surgical training time, patient safety concerns and financial pressures. Simulation is a well-established method of developing surgical skill in a safe and controlled environment away from the patient. We have developed a 3D printed simulation model for the key step of the kidney transplant operation which is the vascular anastomosis. The model is anatomically accurate, based on the CT scans of patients and it incorporates deceased donor vascular tissue. Crucially, it was developed to be used in the robotic operating theatre with the operating robot to enhance its fidelity. It is portable and relatively inexpensive when compared with other forms of simulation such as virtual reality or animal lab training. It thus has the potential of being more accessible as a training tool for the safe acquisition of RAKT specific skills. We demonstrate this model here.",0
1109,Robotically assisted laparoscopy benefits surgical performance under stress,"While the benefits of robotic surgery for the patient have been relatively well established, little is known about the benefits for the surgeon. This study examined whether the advantages of robotically assisted laparoscopy (improved dexterity, a 3-dimensional view, reduction in tremors, etc.) enable the surgeon to better deal with stressful tasks. Subjective and objective (i.e. cardiovascular) responses to stress were assessed while surgeons performed on either a robotic or conventional laparoscopic system. Thirty-two surgeons were assigned to perform a surgical task on either a robotic system or a laparoscopic system, under three stress conditions. The surgeons completed self-report measures of stress before each condition. Furthermore, the surgeons' cardiovascular responses to stress were recorded prior to each condition. Finally, task performance was recorded throughout each condition. While both groups reported experiencing similar levels of stress, compared to the laparoscopic group, the robotic group displayed a more adaptive cardiovascular response to the stress conditions, reflecting a challenge state (i.e. higher blood flow and lower vascular resistance). Furthermore, despite no differences in completion time, the robotic group performed the tasks more accurately than the laparoscopic group across the stress conditions. These results highlight the benefits of using robotic technology during stressful situations. Specifically, the results show that stressful tasks can be performed more accurately with a robotic platform, and that surgeons' cardiovascular responses to stress are more favourable. Importantly, the 'challenge' cardiovascular response to stress displayed when using the robotic system has been associated with more positive long-term health outcomes in domains where stress is commonly experienced (e.g. lower cardiovascular disease risk).",6
1110,Transoral robotic resection of a lingual thyroid: a novel treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea,"A 34-year-old woman with a history of congenital hypothyroidism and 15 years of obstructive sleep apnoea was admitted with a left submandibular swelling secondary to a dental infection. A CT scan of the neck identified an incidental 27 mm tongue base mass and the absence of any cervical thyroid tissue. This mass was not observable on examination of the oropharynx but was seen on fine nasendoscopy while thyroid function tests showed good thyroid stimulating hormone suppression. Her acute dental infection was treated and, following multidisciplinary team discussion, she was diagnosed with an ectopic lingual thyroid. She was offered different management options including no intervention and radio-iodide treatment but opted for transoral robotic resection. The lesion was resected en bloc with clear margins and histology confirmed lingual thyroid tissue. Since the procedure, she has remained free of sleep apnoea with a significantly improved quality of life.",0

1112,Forces exerted during microneurosurgery: a cadaver study,"Background:
        
      
      A prerequisite for the successful design and use of robots in neurosurgery is knowledge of the forces exerted by surgeons during neurosurgical procedures. The aim of the present cadaver study was to measure the surgical instrument forces exerted during microneurosurgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An experimental apparatus was set up consisting of a platform for human cadaver brains, a Leica microscope to provide illumination and magnification, and a Quanser 6 Degrees-Of-Freedom Telepresence System for tissue manipulation and force measurements.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The measured forces varied significantly depending on the region of the brain (P = 0.016) and the maneuver performed (P < 0.0001). Moreover, blunt arachnoid dissection was associated with greater force exertion than sharp dissection (0.22 N vs. 0.03 N; P = 0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The forces necessary to manipulate brain tissue were surprisingly low and varied depending on the anatomical structure being manipulated, and the maneuver performed. Knowledge of such forces could well increase the safety of microsurgery.",1
1113,"Development, validation and clinical application of Pelvic Lymphadenectomy Assessment and Completion Evaluation: intraoperative assessment of lymph node dissection after robot-assisted radical cystectomy for bladder cancer","Objectives:
        
      
      To develop a scoring tool, Pelvic Lymphadenectomy Appropriateness and Completion Evaluation (PLACE), to assess the intraoperative completeness and appropriateness of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) following robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
    


          Patients, subjects and methods:
        
      
      A panel of 11 open and robotic surgeons developed the content and structure of PLACE. The PLND template was divided into three zones. In all, 21 de-identified videos of bilateral robot-assisted PLNDs were assessed by the 11 experts using PLACE to determine inter-rater reliability. Lymph node (LN) clearance was defined as the proportion of cleared LNs from all PLACE zones. We investigated the correlation between LN clearance and LN count. Then, we compared the LN count of 18 prospective PLNDs using PLACE with our retrospective series performed using the extended template (No PLACE).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A significant reliability was achieved for all PLACE zones among the 11 raters for the 21 bilateral PLND videos. The median (interquartile range) for LN clearance was 468 (431-545). There was a significant positive correlation between LN clearance and LN count (R2 = 0.70, P < 0.01). The PLACE group yielded similar LN counts when compared to the No PLACE group.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Pelvic Lymphadenectomy Appropriateness and Completion Evaluation is a structured intraoperative scoring system that can be used intraoperatively to measure and quantify PLND for quality control and to facilitate training during RARC.",3
1114,Design and Implementation of a Bespoke Robotic Manipulator for Extra-corporeal Ultrasound,"With the potential for high precision, dexterity, and repeatability, a self-tracked robotic system can be employed to assist the acquisition of real-time ultrasound. However, limited numbers of robots designed for extra-corporeal ultrasound have been successfully translated into clinical use. In this study, we aim to build a bespoke robotic manipulator for extra-corporeal ultrasound examination, which is lightweight and has a small footprint. The robot is formed by five specially shaped links and custom-made joint mechanisms for probe manipulation, to cover the necessary range of motion with redundant degrees of freedom to ensure the patient's safety. The mechanical safety is emphasized with a clutch mechanism, to limit the force applied to patients. As a result of the design, the total weight of the manipulator is less than 2 kg and the length of the manipulator is about 25 cm. The design has been implemented, and simulation, phantom, and volunteer studies have been performed, to validate the range of motion, the ability to make fine adjustments, mechanical reliability, and the safe operation of the clutch. This paper details the design and implementation of the bespoke robotic ultrasound manipulator, with the design and assembly methods illustrated. Testing results to demonstrate the design features and clinical experience of using the system are presented. It is concluded that the current proposed robotic manipulator meets the requirements as a bespoke system for extra-corporeal ultrasound examination and has great potential to be translated into clinical use.",4
1115,Robotic colorectal surgery: previous laparoscopic colorectal experience is not essential,"A background in minimally invasive colorectal surgery (MICS) has been thought to be essential prior to robotic-assisted colorectal surgery (RACS). Our aim was to determine whether MICS is essential prior to starting RACS training based on results from our initial experience with RACS. Two surgeons from our centre received robotic training through the European Academy of Robotic Colorectal Surgery (EARCS). One surgeon had no prior formal MICS training. We reviewed the first 30 consecutive robotic colorectal procedures from a prospectively maintained database between November 2014 and January 2016 at our institution. Fourteen patients were male. Median age was 64.5 years (range 36-82) and BMI was 27.5 (range 20-32.5). Twelve procedures (40%) were performed by the non-MICS-trained surgeon: ten high anterior resections (one conversion), one low anterior resection and one abdomino-perineal resection of rectum (APER). The MICS-trained surgeon performed nine high and four low anterior resections, one APER and in addition three right hemicolectomies and one abdominal suture rectopexy. There were no intra-operative complications and two patients required re-operation. Median post-operative stay was five days (range 1-26). There were two 30-day re-admissions. All oncological resections had clear margins and median node harvest was 18 (range 9-39). Our case series demonstrates that a background in MICS is not essential prior to starting RACS training. Not having prior MICS training should not discourage surgeons from considering applying for a robotic training programme. Safe and successful robotic colorectal services can be established after completing a formal structured robotic training programme.",3
1116,Robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty: a single-centre experience,"Background:
        
      
      Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is characterised by an obstruction compromising the passage of urine from the renal pelvis into the ureter, and can be corrected by Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty (RALP). We aimed to evaluate the surgical outcomes of RALP, and examine the rates of true pain resolution following the procedure.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively explored the records of all patients who underwent RALP between April 2005 and January 2017. Measures of success were defined as the prevention of deterioration in split renal function and resolution of obstruction, and the resolution or improvement in subjective pain levels.
    


          Results:
        
      
      83 patients were included in this series. Mean patient age was 40.8 years. 38 patients had a left sided RALP, whilst 45 underwent RALP on the right. Crossing vessels were identified in 53.0% of patients. Mean operative time was 148.0 min. 68 patients had pain as their presenting feature. Following RALP, the pain resolved in 69.2% (n = 47), improved in 26.5% (n = 18), and remained the same in 4.4% (n = 3). 11.8% (n = 8) of patients required referral to other specialities for pain management. Success from a radiological perspective of cleared obstruction and arrest of deteriorating renal function was 97.6%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our individual outcomes demonstrate a high success rate regarding resolution of obstruction and preventing deterioration in renal function. We also report that a number of patients, who despite meeting the radiological criteria to undergo RALP, had alternate underlying causes for their pain symptoms. For this reason, we propose that the primary measure of success for RALP should be based on renal function and radiological outcomes, rather than the outcomes relating to pain. Both surgeons and patients should be aware that whilst RALP is a highly successful procedure, persistence of pain may be due to overlapping clinical conditions which can be managed by a multidisciplinary approach.",0
1117,When Can I Trust The Robot? An Algorithm for CT-Based Robotic-Assisted Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been shown to demonstrate a variety of clinical benefits for patients, including reductions in dislocation rates, decreased impingement, and improved implant longevity. However, variability in surgeon experience with robotic systems can lead to inconsistent results. Mastery of the initial acetabular registration step is critical to performing a predictable and accurate robotic-assisted total hip replacement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed 100 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral THA with MAKOplasty®. From this data, we reviewed where errors in planning or registration occurred. These cases either required a repeat registration if the error was caught early, or the errors were realized on postoperative imaging when the x-ray did not match the preoperative plan. Subsequently, we developed an algorithm to ensure accurate registration and implemented its use on the next 100 cases, again reviewing the intraoperative case data and postoperative x-rays for any errors.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Initial analysis revealed that 87 of the first 100 cases were correctly registered, where postoperative acetabular cup position matched the plan on first attempt. Of the remaining 13 cases that had a registration error, eight cases were identified intra-operatively and re-registered. There were five cases where the postoperative x-ray did not match the plan despite a ""good"" registration. For incorrectly registered cases (N = 13), seven of 13 were found to exhibit a type I error (initial registration), while six of 13 demonstrated a type II error (fine point registration). Following the implementation of our registration algorithm, we were able to decrease the discrepancy between the preoperative plan (planning) and the postoperative x-rays (execution) from 13% to 0% of cases.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this study, we present a detailed method to examine registration errors during robotic-navigated THA with MAKOplasty®. From this analysis, we were able to develop a successful algorithm that allows the surgeon to ensure correct registration and ultimately a postoperative x-ray that matches the preoperative plan. Our algorithm presents a principled approach that provides the surgeon and patient confidence in the safety and efficacy a roboticassisted total hip replacement.",0
1118,Robot-assisted nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: the Taiwan Robot Urological Surgery Team (TRUST) experience,"Background:
        
      
      To report Taiwan's experience in robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (RANU) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twenty patients with a diagnosis of renal pelvic or ureteral urothelial carcinoma underwent RANU at three medical centers. We performed RANU by re-docking the robot after the nephrectomy with or without repositioning for excision of the distal ureter and bladder cuff.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From November 2010 to July 2013, a total of 20 patients with a mean age of 70.1 +/- 9.9 years (range 43 to 92 years) and mean body mass index (BMI) of 22.9 +/-3.8 kg/m2 underwent RANU for renal pelvic or ureteral urothelial carcinoma. Mean operative time was 251.6 +/- 126.7 minutes (range 110 to 540 minutes), estimated blood loss was 50.0 +/- 42.9 mL (range 10 to 200 mL), and mean length of hospital stay was 6.7 +/- 2.4 days (range 4 to 12 days). Pathology data revealed 19 high and one low-grade urothelial carcinoma and staged Ta for three, T1 for five, T2 for five and T3 for seven. With a mean follow-up of 14.7 months (range 2 to 34 months), three intravesical recurrences developed in the bladder, and four of them also developed metastatic disease.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The TRUST early experience showed that RANU is a safe and feasible minimally invasive procedure for UTUC.",9
1119,Techniques and Outcomes of Salvage Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (sRARP),"Background:
        
      
      Salvage Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (sRARP) has been described as feasible treatment for the management of localised prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence after primary treatment. However, no large reports have published cancer and quality outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To report perioperative, functional and oncologic outcomes of sRARP in patients with localised PCa recurrence.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      We retrospectively evaluated 106 patients with local recurrence eligible for sRARP.
    


          Surgical procedure:
        
      
      Surgery was performed using the DaVinci Si system similar to the standard approach but with adaptation to the primary treatment.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Peri-operative outcomes included 90-day complication rate. Functional outcomes included rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Oncological outcomes included tumour staging, margin rate and recurrence.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      Primary treatment was High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in 59 (56%) patients, 27 (25%) radiotherapy, 10 (9%) seed brachytherapy, 8 (8%) solitary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), one (1%) cryotherapy and one (1%) electroporation / Nanoknife. Median follow-up was 2.1 years. 90-day complication rate was 8%. At two years or more, 50% were fully continent and 33% were socially continent. Continence rates tended to be better after focal compared to whole-gland treatments. Erectile dysfunction was present in 95%. Positive surgical margin rate was 39%. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 13% and local or metastatic recurrence in 11%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      sRARP is technically more challenging but is a feasible option in high-volume centres for treatment of recurrent PCa. Patients should be counselled that functional outcomes are inferior to primary RARP. Adjustment of surgical technique according to the primary treatment is key for good surgical outcomes.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We report our experience with sRARP for the management of localised PCa recurrence after primary treatment. This represents a feasible approach with acceptable peri-operative complications and cancer outcomes. Functional outcomes are inferior to RARP in the primary setting.",2
1120,Robot-assisted training compared with an enhanced upper limb therapy programme and with usual care for upper limb functional limitation after stroke: the RATULS three-group RCT,"Background:
        
      
      Loss of arm function is common after stroke. Robot-assisted training may improve arm outcomes.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The objectives were to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted training, compared with an enhanced upper limb therapy programme and with usual care.
    


          Design:
        
      
      This was a pragmatic, observer-blind, multicentre randomised controlled trial with embedded health economic and process evaluations.
    


          Setting:
        
      
      The trial was set in four NHS trial centres.
    


          Participants:
        
      
      Patients with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation, between 1 week and 5 years following first stroke, were recruited.
    


          Interventions:
        
      
      Robot-assisted training using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Manus robotic gym system (InMotion commercial version, Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA), an enhanced upper limb therapy programme comprising repetitive functional task practice, and usual care.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      The primary outcome was upper limb functional recovery 'success' (assessed using the Action Research Arm Test) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes at 3 and 6 months were the Action Research Arm Test results, upper limb impairment (measured using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment), activities of daily living (measured using the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index), quality of life (measured using the Stroke Impact Scale), resource use costs and quality-adjusted life-years.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 770 participants were randomised (robot-assisted training, n = 257; enhanced upper limb therapy, n = 259; usual care, n = 254). Upper limb functional recovery 'success' was achieved in the robot-assisted training [103/232 (44%)], enhanced upper limb therapy [118/234 (50%)] and usual care groups [85/203 (42%)]. These differences were not statistically significant; the adjusted odds ratios were as follows: robot-assisted training versus usual care, 1.2 (98.33% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.0); enhanced upper limb therapy versus usual care, 1.5 (98.33% confidence interval 0.9 to 2.5); and robot-assisted training versus enhanced upper limb therapy, 0.8 (98.33% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.3). The robot-assisted training group had less upper limb impairment (as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment motor subscale) than the usual care group at 3 and 6 months. The enhanced upper limb therapy group had less upper limb impairment (as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment motor subscale), better mobility (as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale mobility domain) and better performance in activities of daily living (as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale activities of daily living domain) than the usual care group, at 3 months. The robot-assisted training group performed less well in activities of daily living (as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale activities of daily living domain) than the enhanced upper limb therapy group at 3 months. No other differences were clinically important and statistically significant. Participants found the robot-assisted training and the enhanced upper limb therapy group programmes acceptable. Neither intervention, as provided in this trial, was cost-effective at current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence willingness-to-pay thresholds for a quality-adjusted life-year.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robot-assisted training did not improve upper limb function compared with usual care. Although robot-assisted training improved upper limb impairment, this did not translate into improvements in other outcomes. Enhanced upper limb therapy resulted in potentially important improvements on upper limb impairment, in performance of activities of daily living, and in mobility. Neither intervention was cost-effective.
    


          Future work:
        
      
      Further research is needed to find ways to translate the improvements in upper limb impairment seen with robot-assisted training into improvements in upper limb function and activities of daily living. Innovations to make rehabilitation programmes more cost-effective are required.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Pragmatic inclusion criteria led to the recruitment of some participants with little prospect of recovery. The attrition rate was higher in the usual care group than in the robot-assisted training or enhanced upper limb therapy groups, and differential attrition is a potential source of bias. Obtaining accurate information about the usual care that participants were receiving was a challenge.

1123,A comparison of operative and margin outcomes from surgeon learning curves in robot assisted radical prostatectomy in a changing referral practice,"Introduction The aim of this study was to explore the impact of increasing proportions of high risk referrals on surgical margin outcomes of a surgeon's learning curve in robotic prostatectomy. Methods All patients in this study underwent robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed by three different consultant urological surgeons. Data collected included preoperative clinical stage, Gleason score and prostate specific antigen levels, which were used to risk stratify patients according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria. Oncological clearance was assessed by overall and stage specific positive margin status. Comparisons were made between each surgeon for the first and second 50 consecutive cases. Results For the three surgeons, there was a progressive increase in the proportion of high risk cases referred accompanied by a corresponding decline in low risk disease (p<0.001). Postoperative pathology also showed an upward trend in pT3 cases across the three eras. There was no statistical difference in overall positive margin rates between the surgeons. The overall rates were 12%, 20% and 23% for the first 50 cases, and 32%, 36% and 21% for the second 50 cases for the three surgeons respectively. Conclusions Our series demonstrates an upward trend in the risk profile of men referred for robotic prostatectomy over a nine-year period. Despite this, there was minimal impact on pathological and surgical outcomes among our surgeons, who were at the initial stages of their RARP learning curve. Our results suggest that there is no requirement for an active case selection bias against patients with high risk disease for surgeons newly embarking on their RARP learning experience.",2
1124,"Hurry Up, We Need to Find the Key! How Regulatory Focus Design Affects Children's Trust in a Social Robot","In educational scenarios involving social robots, understanding the way robot behaviors affect children's motivation to achieve their learning goals is of vital importance. It is crucial for the formation of a trust relationship between the child and the robot so that the robot can effectively fulfill its role as a learning companion. In this study, we investigate the effect of a regulatory focus design scenario on the way children interact with a social robot. Regulatory focus theory is a type of self-regulation that involves specific strategies in pursuit of goals. It provides insights into how a person achieves a particular goal, either through a strategy focused on ""promotion"" that aims to achieve positive outcomes or through one focused on ""prevention"" that aims to avoid negative outcomes. In a user study, 69 children (7-9 years old) played a regulatory focus design goal-oriented collaborative game with the EMYS robot. We assessed children's perception of likability and competence and their trust in the robot, as well as their willingness to follow the robot's suggestions when pursuing a goal. Results showed that children perceived the prevention-focused robot as being more likable than the promotion-focused robot. We observed that a regulatory focus design did not directly affect trust. However, the perception of likability and competence was positively correlated with children's trust but negatively correlated with children's acceptance of the robot's suggestions.",4

Previous research has shown that the characteristics of robot communication positively affect human-robot interaction outcomes such as usability, trust, workload, and performance. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of transparency and anthropomorphism in robotic dual-channel communication, encompassing the voice channel (low or high, increasing the amount of information provided by textual information) and the visual channel (low or high, increasing the amount of information provided by expressive information). The results showed the benefits and limitations of increasing the transparency and anthropomorphism, demonstrating the significance of the careful implementation of transparency methods. The limitations and future directions are discussed.",4

Here, we describe a protocol for automated high-throughput (AHT) ChIP-seq. To demonstrate the quality of data obtained using AHT-ChIP-seq, we applied it to five proteins in mouse livers using a single 96-well plate, demonstrating an extremely high degree of qualitative and quantitative reproducibility among biological and technical replicates. We estimated the optimum and minimum recommended cell numbers required to perform AHT-ChIP-seq by running an additional plate using HepG2 and MCF7 cells. With this protocol, commercially available robotics can perform four hundred experiments in five days.",7
1128,Abstract and proportional myoelectric control for multi-fingered hand prostheses,"Powered hand prostheses with many degrees of freedom are moving from research into the market for prosthetics. In order to make use of the prostheses' full functionality, it is essential to study efficient ways of high dimensional myoelectric control. Human subjects can rapidly learn to employ electromyographic (EMG) activity of several hand and arm muscles to control the position of a cursor on a computer screen, even if the muscle-cursor map contradicts directions in which the muscles would act naturally. But can a similar control scheme be translated into real-time operation of a dexterous robotic hand? We found that despite different degrees of freedom in the effector output, the learning process for controlling a robotic hand was surprisingly similar to that for a virtual two-dimensional cursor. Control signals were derived from the EMG in two different ways, with a linear and a Bayesian filter, to test how stable user intentions could be conveyed through them. Our analysis indicates that without visual feedback, control accuracy benefits from filters that reject high EMG amplitudes. In summary, we conclude that findings on myoelectric control principles, studied in abstract, virtual tasks can be transferred to real-life prosthetic applications.",4
1129,Outcomes of EAU-endorsed Live Surgical Events over a 5-year Period (2015-2020) and Updated Guidelines from the EAU Live Surgery Committee,"Context:
        
      
      Live surgery events (LSEs) have been used in all surgical fields for education and training and to demonstrate new techniques. The European Association of Urology (EAU) live surgery guidelines were established in 2014.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To review the compliance of outcomes for procedures performed at EAU-affiliated LSEs with the 2014 guidelines and to establish updated guidelines for LSEs and semi-LSEs.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      Patients from EAU-affiliated LSEs were included for all surgical procedures carried out between January 2015 and January 2020. All these events were pre-evaluated by the EAU Live Surgery Committee and met the criteria for an EAU LSE, with outcomes recorded and submitted to the registry. Data were collected for the type of procedure and for intraoperative and short- and long-term complications.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      A total of 246 procedures were performed across 18 LSEs, with an annual volume ranging from 19 to 74 procedures. These included 109 (44.3%) robot-assisted procedures, 21 (8.5%) laparoscopic procedures, 10 (4%) transurethral bladder procedures, 11 (4.4%) prostate enucleation procedures, 72 (29.2%) endourological procedures, and 23 (9.3%) andrology or reconstruction procedures. A total of 77 different surgical techniques and variations for 55 different types of surgery were performed as LSEs over the past 5 yr. There were 44 (17.8%) short-term complications and 11.3% (nine/79) long-term complications observed, with Clavien grade III/IV complications seen in 5.2% and 7.5% of cases over short- and long-term follow-up, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The 5-yr outcomes for EAU LSEs show that they are safe and follow previous guidelines set by the panel. It seems likely that the fine balance between patient safety and educational value might be best achieved if LSEs are performed by local surgeons in their parent hospital with patients and staff they know, and that technological advances will make live streaming a seamless process. The current EAU Live Surgery Committee has updated the guidelines on LSEs and provided new guidelines for semi-live events.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      We reviewed 5-year outcomes for live surgery events endorsed by the European Association of Urology. We found that the operations carried out at these events were safe and followed the guidelines previously set. We have updated the guidelines and provided new guidelines for semi-live events.",2
1130,Is ovarian cancer surgery stuck in the dark ages?: a commentary piece reviewing surgical technologies,"Ovarian cancer surgery endeavours to remove all visible tumour deposits, and surgical technologies could potentially facilitate this aim. However, there appear to be barriers around the adoption of new technologies, and we hope this article provokes discussion within the specialty to encourage a forward-thinking approach to new-age surgical gynaecological oncology.",1
1131,Sequential robotic-assisted lung resection with a subxiphoid utility incision,"For the past two years, the authors have used a subxiphoid utility incision for robot-assisted lobectomies. This approach prevents unnecessary rib pressure, offers a good angle of approach to the hilum, and allows specimen retrieval with minimal resistance. Robot-assisted lung resection is an established technique that facilitates postoperative recovery by minimizing operative trauma and postoperative pain. We believe the subxiphoid utility incision further enhances recovery and facilitates early repeat surgery. We present two cases of staged sequential robot-assisted anatomical lung resection using the same subxiphoid utility incision on each occasion.",0
1132,Protocol for the systematic review of the reporting of transoral robotic surgery,"Introduction:
        
      
      Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has been adopted in some parts of the world as an innovative approach to the resection of oropharyngeal tumours. The development, details and outcomes of early-to-later phase evaluation of this technique and the quality of evidence to support its adoption into practice have hitherto not been summarised. The aim of this review is to identify and summarise the early and later phase studies of, and evidence for, TORS and to understand how early phase studies report intervention development, governance procedures and selection and reporting of outcomes to optimise methods for using the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework for surgical innovation that informs evidence-based practice. The protocol has been written in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols checklist.
    


          Methods and analysis:
        
      
      Electronic searches in OVID SP versions of Medline and EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the start of indexing to 30 April 2017 will identify studies reporting TORS. At least two independent researchers will identify studies for inclusion. Two researchers will extract data from each paper. Studies will be categorised into IDEAL stages of study design from 'pre-IDEAL' to randomised controlled trials (stage 3). Data will be collected about the (1) novel intervention and criteria for modification, (2) governance arrangements and patient information provision, (3) outcome domains selected and reported and (4) quality of study design, conduct and reporting. Descriptive statistics and a narrative synthesis will be presented.
    


          Ethics and dissemination:
        
      
      The results of this systematic review will be presented at relevant conferences. The methods will be used to inform future reviews exploring other novel surgical innovations. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This study does not require ethical approval.",1
1133,"Scoping review of approaches used for remote-access parathyroidectomy: A contemporary review of techniques, tools, pros and cons","After our coauthors described the first remote-access parathyroidectomy (RAP) series in 2000, several other approaches were developed. No systematic review has been performed to classify and evaluate RAP techniques. We performed a literature search using PubMed and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL). A total of 71 studies met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. RAP can be categorized into five approaches: (1) endoscopic and robotic axillary, (2) anterior chest, (3) transoral, (4) retroauricular, and (5) a combination of these approaches. The limited data in the literature suggest that the cure rates and safety of RAP are in no way inferior to those of open parathyroidectomy. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the recommendations for the selection of each approach are listed. The selection of approach methods might depend on the surgeon's experience and familiarity and the patient's preference and disease status.",1
1134,Robot-Assisted Carotid Artery Stenting: A Safety and Feasibility Study,"Purpose:
        
      
      Endovascular robotics is an emerging technology within the developing field of medical robotics. This was a prospective evaluation to assess safety and feasibility of robotic-assisted carotid artery stenting.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Consecutive cases of carotid artery stenting cases performed over period of 24 months, from May 2015 to October 2016, using the Magellan Robotic System (Hansen, Mountain View, CA) were included. All cases utilised the robotic system to navigate the arch, obtain a stable position in the common carotid artery, followed by manual manipulation of Embolic Protection Devices and self-expandable stents through the robotic catheter. Patients demographics, clinical indications, anatomical features, technical and clinical success, complication rate and hospital stay were prospectively recorded.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirteen patients, 10 males (78.5%), with an average age of 68.7 years were treated. Mean follow up time was 30 months. Ten patients (91%) were symptomatic at presentation. Anatomical indications for endovascular stent insertion were previous open surgery to the neck ± radiotherapy (87.5%) and hostile anatomy for open surgery (12.5%). Technical success was 100% and the robotic system demonstrates enhanced stability during arch and lesion crossing. There were no neurological complications post-operatively. Average hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-6 days) and a change in serum creatinine of -7.8 μmol/L. There was no documented case of in stent restenosis, new or worsening neurology during follow-up.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These results illustrate safety and feasibility of robotic endovascular revascularisation for carotid disease and demonstrates potential to enhance peri-procedural safety through improved control and stability.",1
1135,Robotic Telemedicine for Mental Health: A Multimodal Approach to Improve Human-Robot Engagement,"COVID-19 has severely impacted mental health in vulnerable demographics, in particular older adults, who face unprecedented isolation. Consequences, while globally severe, are acutely pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) confronting pronounced gaps in resources and clinician accessibility. Social robots are well-recognized for their potential to support mental health, yet user compliance (i.e., trust) demands seamless affective human-robot interactions; natural 'human-like' conversations are required in simple, inexpensive, deployable platforms. We present the design, development, and pilot testing of a multimodal robotic framework fusing verbal (contextual speech) and nonverbal (facial expressions) social cues, aimed to improve engagement in human-robot interaction and ultimately facilitate mental health telemedicine during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the design optimization of a hybrid face robot, which combines digital facial expressions based on mathematical affect space mapping with static 3D facial features. We further introduce a contextual virtual assistant with integrated cloud-based AI coupled to the robot's facial representation of emotions, such that the robot adapts its emotional response to users' speech in real-time. Experiments with healthy participants demonstrate emotion recognition exceeding 90% for happy, tired, sad, angry, surprised and stern/disgusted robotic emotions. When separated, stern and disgusted are occasionally transposed (70%+ accuracy overall) but are easily distinguishable from other emotions. A qualitative user experience analysis indicates overall enthusiastic and engaging reception to human-robot multimodal interaction with the new framework. The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs. The mechanically simple and low-cost social robot has been deployed in pilot tests to support older individuals and PwD at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai, India. A procedure for deployment addressing challenges in cultural acceptance, end-user acclimatization and resource allocation is further introduced. Results indicate strong promise to stimulate human-robot psychosocial interaction through the hybrid-face robotic system. Future work is targeting deployment for telemedicine to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults and PwD in both LMICs and higher income regions.",4
1136,Transoral Robotic Surgery for Oropharyngeal Cancer,"Transoral robotic surgery has shown significant promise in the management of oropharyngeal cancer since its description in 2007. The oncological efficacy of this procedure has been proven in several single-centre studies, multicentre collaborative publications and systematic reviews. The rapid take-up of transoral robotic surgery shows greater acceptance by professionals and is associated with a relatively short learning curve. This overview discusses the rationale and principles underlying the use of transoral robotic surgery in primary and recurrent oropharyngeal cancer and the emerging role for this technique in diagnosing the unknown primary site, and summarizes ongoing research in this field.",1
1137,The black sheep effect: The case of the deviant ingroup robot,"The black sheep effect (BSE) describes the evaluative upgrading of norm-compliant group members (ingroup bias), and evaluative downgrading of deviant (norm-violating) group members, relative to similar outgroup members. While the BSE has been demonstrated extensively in human groups, it has yet to be shown in groups containing robots. This study investigated whether a BSE towards a 'deviant' robot (one low on warmth and competence) could be demonstrated. Participants performed a visual tracking task in a team with two humanoid NAO robots, with one robot being an ingroup member and the other an outgroup member. The robots offered advice to the participants which could be accepted or rejected, proving a measure of trust. Both robots were also evaluated using questionnaires, proxemics, and forced preference choices. Experiment 1 (N = 18) manipulated robot grouping to test our group manipulation generated ingroup bias (a necessary precursor to the BSE) which was supported. Experiment 2 (N = 72) manipulated the grouping, warmth and competence of both robots, predicting a BSE towards deviant ingroup robots, which was supported. Results indicated that a disagreeable ingroup robot is viewed less favourably than a disagreeable outgroup robot. Furthermore, when interacting with two independent robots, a ""majority rule"" effect can occur in which each robot's opinion is treated as independent vote, with participants significantly more likely to trust two unanimously disagreeing robots. No effect of warmth was found. The impact of these findings for human-robot team composition are discussed.",6
1138,Human-robot interaction: how worker influence in task allocation improves autonomy,"Task allocation research is often efficiency-focussed, but procedural and work-psychological perspectives are required to enable human-centred human-robot interaction (HRI). Hence, the motivational and cognitive outcomes of the degree of worker influence over task allocation are relevant to research objects for allocation process design. In a laboratory experiment, 87 participants manufactured goods in collaboration with a robot under three conditions: (1) a support system decided the allocation, (2) a support-system allocation could be revised, (3) the participant determined the allocation. Conditions affected mental effort, process control and autonomy, resulting in higher values when participants allocated tasks themselves. Satisfaction with the process appears lower with no worker influence. Trust in the support-system moderates the condition effect, with higher satisfaction depending on trust when a system is involved in allocation. An allocation made by the workers and adaptability is preferred. Results show the importance of worker influence over task allocation in HRI. Practitioner Summary: Our experiment on allocation processes seeks to satisfy the gap in human-centred psychological research on task allocation in human-robot interaction (HRI). For successful, ergonomic HRI, it is found that workers should be provided with influence over task allocation.",4
1139,Robotic endovascular surgery: current and future practice,"Minimally invasive techniques have been at the forefront of surgical progress, and the evolution of endovascular robotic technologies has seen a paradigm shift in the focus of future innovation. Endovascular robotic technology may help overcome many of the challenges associated with traditional endovascular techniques by enabling greater control, stability, and precision of target navigation and treatment, while simultaneously reducing operator learning curves and improving safety. Several robotic systems have been developed to perform a broad range of endovascular procedures, but none have been used at scale or widely in routine practice, and the evidence for their safety, effectiveness, and efficiency remains limited. High cost and device complexity, lack of haptic feedback, and limited integration and interoperability with existing equipment and devices are the principal technology, cost, and sustainability barriers to the scalability and widespread adoption in day-to-day practice. In order to fully realize its potential, future robotic innovation must ensure compatibility with a range of off-the-shelf equipment that can be tracked and exchanged quickly during a procedure and come together with developments in navigation, tracking, and imaging. Reducing cost and complexity and supporting sustainability of the technology is key. In parallel, new technologies must be evaluated by clear and transparent standardized outcomes and be accompanied by robust clinical training. Key to the successful future development and dissemination of robotic technology is open collaboration among industry, clinicians, and patients in order to fully understand and address current challenges and enable the technology to realize its full potential.",1
1140,Factors that affect younger and older adults' causal attributions of robot behaviour,"Stereotypes are cognitive shortcuts that facilitate efficient social judgments about others. Just as causal attributions affect perceptions of people, they may similarly affect perceptions of technology, particularly anthropomorphic technology such as robots. In a scenario-based study, younger and older adults judged the performance and capability of an anthropomorphised robot that appeared young or old. In some cases, the robot successfully performed a task while at other times it failed. Results showed that older adult participants were more susceptible to aging stereotypes as indicated by trust. In addition, both younger and older adult participants succumbed to aging stereotypes when measuring perceived capability of the robots. Finally, a summary of causal reasoning results showed that our participants may have applied aging stereotypes to older-appearing robots: they were most likely to give credit to a properly functioning robot when it appeared young and performed a cognitive task. Our results tentatively suggest that human theories of social cognition do not wholly translate to technology-based contexts and that future work may elaborate on these findings. Practitioner summary: Perception and expectations of the capabilities of robots may influence whether users accept and use them, especially older users. The current results suggest that care must be taken in the design of these robots as users may stereotype them.",4
1141,Robotic versus conventional laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:
        
      
      Robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) offers theoretical advantages to conventional laparoscopic surgery including improved instrument dexterity, 3D visualization and better ergonomics. This review aimed to determine if these theoretical advantages translate into improved patient outcomes comparing patients having either robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy or laparoscopic (LPD) equivalent.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A systematic literature search was conducted for studies reporting minimally invasive surgery for pancreaticoduodenectomy either robotic assisted or totally laparoscopic. Meta-analysis of intra-operative (blood loss, operating times, conversion and R0 resections) and postoperative outcomes (overall complications, pancreatic fistula, length of hospital stay) was performed using a random effects model.
    


          Result:
        
      
      This review identified 44 studies, of which six were non-randomised comparative studies including 3462 patients (1025 robotic and 2437 laparoscopic). Intraoperatively, RPD was associated with significantly lower conversion rates (OR 0.45, p < 0.001) and transfusion rates (OR: 0.60, p = 0.002) compared to LPD. However, no significant difference in blood loss (mean: 220 vs 287 mL, p = 0.1), operating time (mean: 405 vs 418 min, p = 0.3) was noted. Postoperatively RPD was associated with a shorter hospital stay (mean: 12 vs 11 days, p < 0.001) but no significant difference was noted in postoperative complications, incidence of pancreatic fistulae and R0 resection rates.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RPD appears to offer some advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery, although both approaches appear to offer equivalent clinical outcomes. Importantly, the quality of evidence is generally limited to cohort studies and a high-quality randomised trial comparing both techniques is needed.",9
1142,More Than a Feeling-Interrelation of Trust Layers in Human-Robot Interaction and the Role of User Dispositions and State Anxiety,"With service robots becoming more ubiquitous in social life, interaction design needs to adapt to novice users and the associated uncertainty in the first encounter with this technology in new emerging environments. Trust in robots is an essential psychological prerequisite to achieve safe and convenient cooperation between users and robots. This research focuses on psychological processes in which user dispositions and states affect trust in robots, which in turn is expected to impact the behavior and reactions in the interaction with robotic systems. In a laboratory experiment, the influence of propensity to trust in automation and negative attitudes toward robots on state anxiety, trust, and comfort distance toward a robot were explored. Participants were approached by a humanoid domestic robot two times and indicated their comfort distance and trust. The results favor the differentiation and interdependence of dispositional, initial, and dynamic learned trust layers. A mediation from the propensity to trust to initial learned trust by state anxiety provides an insight into the psychological processes through which personality traits might affect interindividual outcomes in human-robot interaction (HRI). The findings underline the meaningfulness of user characteristics as predictors for the initial approach to robots and the importance of considering users' individual learning history regarding technology and robots in particular.",4
1143,The Influence of Robots' Fairness on Humans' Reward-Punishment Behaviors and Trust in Human-Robot Cooperative Teams,"Objective:
        
      
      Based on social exchange theory, this study investigates the effects of robots' fairness and social status on humans' reward-punishment behaviors and trust in human-robot interactions.
    


          Background:
        
      
      In human-robot teamwork, robots show fair behaviors, dedication (altruistic unfair behaviors), and selfishness (self-interested unfair behaviors), but few studies have discussed the effects of these robots' behaviors on teamwork.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This study adopts a 3 (the independent variable is the robot's fairness: self-interested unfair behaviors, fair behaviors, and altruistic unfair behaviors) × 3 (the moderator variable is the robot's social status: superior, peer, and subordinate) experimental design. Each participant and a robot completed the experimental task together through a computer.
    


          Results:
        
      
      When robots have different social statuses, the more altruistic the fairness of the robot, the more reward behaviors, the fewer punishment behaviors, and the higher human-robot trust of humans. Robots' higher social status weakens the influence of their fairness on humans' punishment behaviors. Human-robot trust will increase humans' reward behaviors and decrease humans' punishment behaviors. Humans' reward-punishment behaviors will increase repaired human-robot trust.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robots' fairness has a significant impact on humans' reward-punishment behaviors and trust. Robots' social status moderates the effect of their fair behavior on humans' punishment behavior. There is an interaction between humans' reward-punishment behaviors and trust.
    


          Application:
        
      
      The study can help to better understand the interaction mechanism of the human-robot team and can better serve the management and cooperation of the human-robot team by appropriately adjusting the robots' fairness and social status.",4
1144,Advancing the Strategic Messages Affecting Robot Trust Effect: The Dynamic of User- and Robot-Generated Content on Human-Robot Trust and Interaction Outcomes,"Human-robot interaction (HRI) will soon transform and shift the communication landscape such that people exchange messages with robots. However, successful HRI requires people to trust robots, and, in turn, the trust affects the interaction. Although prior research has examined the determinants of human-robot trust (HRT) during HRI, no research has examined the messages that people received before interacting with robots and their effect on HRT. We conceptualize these messages as SMART (Strategic Messages Affecting Robot Trust). Moreover, we posit that SMART can ultimately affect actual HRI outcomes (i.e., robot evaluations, robot credibility, participant mood) by affording the persuasive influences from user-generated content (UGC) on participatory Web sites. In Study 1, participants were assigned to one of two conditions (UGC/control) in an original experiment of HRT. Compared with the control (descriptive information only), results showed that UGC moderated the correlation between HRT and interaction outcomes in a positive direction (average Δr = +0.39) for robots as media and robots as tools. In Study 2, we explored the effect of robot-generated content but did not find similar moderation effects. These findings point to an important empirical potential to employ SMART in future robot deployment.",4
1145,The impact of a fellow on a regional robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy service,"Introduction:
        
      
      Training a fellow has a cost in time and effort for the surgeon and their team. Their relative inexperience may also negatively affect the patient. The aim of this study was to determine and quantify the impact of a fellow on a regional robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy service and on perioperative outcomes.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      We reviewed the prospectively collected data for 522 patients who had undergone robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy since 2015 during the tenure of six fellows. Perioperative outcomes for three groups were compared: group A (no fellow participation), group B (some participation) and group C (fellow completed entire operation). We also reviewed progression over 12 months.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Demographics were similar in all groups apart from the percentage of men, which was lower in group C (p < 0.05). Operative time was 27 minutes longer for group B (p < 0.001). Warm ischaemia time was significantly shorter for group A but the difference was only four minutes (p < 0.001). Length of stay was slightly shorter for group C compared with the other groups (p < 0.01). Trifecta achievement was greatest for group A (p < 0.001). There were no perioperative deaths in any group and positive margins, complications and readmissions were low and similar in all groups. Towards the end of their fellowship, fellows performed more operations independently.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There is a measurable, but small, negative impact of a fellow on a robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy service, which reduces with experience. With appropriate supervision and patient selection, a fellow can be taught robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy without affecting patient safety or treatment outcome.",8
1146,Robotic-assisted diaphragmatic plication: Improving safety and effectiveness in the treatment of diaphragmatic paralysis,"Background:
        
      
      Diaphragmatic plication can be performed with various surgical approaches. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of robotic-assisted plication.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent diaphragmatic plication from 2017 to 2021.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eighteen patients underwent 20 operations, 11 of which were performed with robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) and 9 with open transthoracic approach. RATS was associated with shorter operating time (80 vs. 120 min; p = 0.04), less blood loss (20 vs. 100 ml; p = 0.01), shorter chest-drain duration (1 vs. 3 days; p = 0.01), and shorter length of stay (3 vs. 7 days; p = 0.04). The median grade in the Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale improved from four to two in both groups.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted diaphragmatic plication is a safe procedure that can significantly improve dyspnoea and is associated with shorter hospitalisation compared to open approach.",9
1147,Selection and control of limb posture for stability,"Impedance control can be used to stabilize the limb against both instability and unpredictable perturbations. Limb posture influences motor noise, energy usage and limb impedance as well as their interaction. Here we examine whether subjects use limb posture as part of a mechanism to regulate limb stability. Subjects performed stabilization tasks while attached to a two dimensional robotic manipulandum which generated a virtual environment. Subjects were instructed that they could perform the stabilization task anywhere in the workspace, while the chosen postures were tracked as subjects repeated the task. In order to investigate the mechanisms behind the chosen limb postures, simulations of the neuro-mechanical system were performed. The results indicate that posture selection is performed to provide energy efficiency in the presence of force variability.",4
1148,Added value of 3D-vision during robotic pancreatoduodenectomy anastomoses in biotissue (LAEBOT 3D2D): a randomized controlled cross-over trial,"Background:
        
      
      We tested the added value of 3D-vision on procedure time and surgical performance during robotic pancreatoduodenectomy anastomoses in biotissue. Robotic surgery has the advantage of articulating instruments and 3D-vision. Consensus is lacking on the added value of 3D-vision during laparoscopic surgery. Given the improved dexterity with robotic surgery, the added value of 3D-vision may be even less with robotic surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this experimental randomized controlled cross-over trial, 20 surgeons and surgical residents from 5 countries performed robotic pancreaticojejunostomy and hepaticojejunostomy anastomoses in a biotissue organ model using the da Vinci® system and were randomized to start with either 3D- or 2D-vision. Primary endpoint was the time required to complete both anastomoses. Secondary endpoint was the objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS; range 12-60) rating; scored by two observers blinded to 3D/2D.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Robotic 3D-vision reduced the combined operative time from 78.1 to 57.3 min (24.6% reduction, p < 0.001; 20.8 min reduction, 95% confidence intervals 12.8-28.8 min). This reduction was consistent for both anastomoses and between surgeons and residents, p < 0.001. Robotic 3D-vision improved OSATS performance by 6.1 points (20.8% improvement, p = 0.003) compared to 2D (39.4 to 45.1 points, ± 5.5).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      3D-vision has a considerable added value during robotic pancreatoduodenectomy anastomoses in biotissue in both time reduction and improved surgical performance as compared to 2D-vision.",1
1149,BCI controlled robotic arm as assistance to the rehabilitation of neurologically disabled patients,"Purpose:
        
      
      Brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled assistive robotic systems have been developed with increasing success with the aim to rehabilitation of patients after brain injury to increase independence and quality of life. While such systems may use surgically implanted invasive sensors, non-invasive alternatives can be better suited due to the ease of use, reduced cost, improvements in accuracy and reliability with the advancement of the technology and practicality of use. The consumer-grade BCI devices are often capable of integrating multiple types of signals, including Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG) signals.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      This paper summarizes the development of a portable and cost-efficient BCI-controlled assistive technology using a non-invasive BCI headset ""OpenBCI"" and an open source robotic arm, U-Arm, to accomplish tasks related to rehabilitation, such as access to resources, adaptability or home use. The resulting system used a combination of EEG and EMG sensor readings to control the arm. To avoid risks of injury while the device is being used in clinical settings, appropriate measures were incorporated into the software control of the arm. A short survey was used following the system usability scale (SUS), to measure the usability of the technology to be trialed in clinical settings.
    


          Results:
        
      
      From the experimental results, it was found that EMG is a very reliable method for assistive technology control, provided that the user specific EMG calibration is done. With the EEG, even though the results were promising, due to insufficient detection of the signal, the controller was not adequate to be used within a neurorehabilitation environment. The survey indicated that the usability of the system is not a barrier for moving the system into clinical trials.Implication on rehabilitationFor the rehabilitation of patients suffering from neurological disabilities (particularly those suffering from varying degrees of paralysis), it is necessary to develop technology that bypasses the limitations of their condition. For example, if a patient is unable to walk due to the unresponsiveness in their motor neurons, technology can be developed that used an alternate input to move an exoskeleton, which enables the patient to walk again with the assistance of the exoskeleton.This research focuses on neuro-rehabilitation within the framework of the NHS at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital in UK. The hospital currently does not have any system in place for self-driven rehabilitation and instead relies on traditional rehabilitation methods through assistance from physicians and exercise regimens to maintain muscle movement.This paper summarises the development of a portable and cost-efficient BCI controlled assistive technology using a non-invasive BCI headset ""OpenBCI"" and an open source robotic arm, U-Arm, to accomplish tasks related to rehabilitation, such as access to resources, adaptability or home use. The resulting system used a combination of EEG and EMG sensor readings to control the arm, which could perform a number of different tasks such as picking/placing objects or assist users in eating.",0
1150,Robotic Automation of In Vivo Two-Photon Targeted Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology,"Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recording is a powerful technique for studying cellular function. While in vivo patch-clamp recording has recently benefited from automation, it is normally performed ""blind,"" meaning that throughput for sampling some genetically or morphologically defined cell types is unacceptably low. One solution to this problem is to use two-photon microscopy to target fluorescently labeled neurons. Combining this with robotic automation is difficult, however, as micropipette penetration induces tissue deformation, moving target cells from their initial location. Here we describe a platform for automated two-photon targeted patch-clamp recording, which solves this problem by making use of a closed loop visual servo algorithm. Our system keeps the target cell in focus while iteratively adjusting the pipette approach trajectory to compensate for tissue motion. We demonstrate platform validation with patch-clamp recordings from a variety of cells in the mouse neocortex and cerebellum.",7
1151,Integrated surgery and radiology: trans-oral robotic surgery guided by real-time radiologist-operated intraoral ultrasound,"Purpose:
        
      
      We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and utility of intraoral ultrasound as a real-time guidance technique in trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We report our early experiences of radiologist-operated intraoral ultrasound during TORS, providing information on tumour margin and important adjacent structures. Resection specimens were sonographically imaged for margin assessment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Four patients underwent ultrasound-guided TORS, with a close correlation between intraoperative and preoperative imaging in each case. The tumour was fully excised in three cases (one did not proceed due to difficult access). No ultrasound-related adverse events occurred, surgical margins were negative, and the treated patients are currently in a state of remission, with functional swallows.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Intraoperative ultrasound can allow previously inaccessible disease to be robotically resected with confidence. Sonographic interrogation of the resected specimen correlated closely with histological margin analysis, and a novel technique of using saline to improve ultrasound conductance and therefore image quality is described.",1
1152,A proof of concept study investigating the feasibility of combining iPAM robot assisted rehabilitation with functional electrical stimulation to deliver whole arm exercise in stroke survivors,"Rehabilitation robots can provide exercise for stroke survivors with weakness at the shoulder and elbow, but most do not facilitate hand movements. The aim was to combine robotics and functional electrical stimulation to facilitate exercise in stroke survivors with upper limb impairment. iPAM Mk II was used to assist active reaching in combination with an Odstock Pace stimulator to assist hand opening. The ABILHAND, Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) were recorded at baseline and completion. Nine participants (eight males and one female; mean age = 58 years) were recruited; mean time since stroke was 16 months (range = 6-64). The ABILHAND at baseline was -2.73, improving to -1.45 at follow-up (p = 0.038). The ARAT changed from 4.1 to 2.6 (p = 0.180), and the SIS from 49 to 60 (p = 0.019). This study demonstrates that it is possible to combine two technologies in stroke rehabilitation.",6
1153,Robot-assisted and fluoroscopy-guided pedicle screw placement: a systematic review,"Purpose:
        
      
      At present, most spinal surgeons undertake pedicle screw implantation using either anatomical landmarks or C-arm fluoroscopy. Reported rates of screw malposition using these techniques vary considerably, though the evidence generally favors the use of image-guidance systems. A miniature spine-mounted robot has recently been developed to further improve the accuracy of pedicle screw placement. In this systematic review, we critically appraise the perceived benefits of robot-assisted pedicle screw placement compared to conventional fluoroscopy-guided technique.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched between January 2006 and January 2013 to identify relevant publications that (1) featured placement of pedicle screws, (2) compared robot-assisted and fluoroscopy-guided surgery, (3) assessed outcome in terms of pedicle screw position, and (4) present sufficient data in each arm to enable meaningful comparison (>10 pedicle screws in each study group).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 246 articles were retrieved, of which 5 articles met inclusion criteria, collectively reporting placement of 1,308 pedicle screws (729 robot-assisted, 579 fluoroscopy-guided). The findings of these studies are mixed, with limited higher level of evidence data favoring fluoroscopy-guided procedures, and remaining comparative studies supporting robot-assisted pedicle screw placement.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      There is insufficient evidence to unequivocally recommend one surgical technique over the other. Given the high cost of robotic systems, and the high risk of spinal surgery, further high quality studies are required to address unresolved clinical equipoise in this field.",1
1154,Robot Lies in Health Care: When Is Deception Morally Permissible?,"Autonomous robots are increasingly interacting with users who have limited knowledge of robotics and are likely to have an erroneous mental model of the robot's workings, capabilities, and internal structure. The robot's real capabilities may diverge from this mental model to the extent that one might accuse the robot's manufacturer of deceiving the user, especially in cases where the user naturally tends to ascribe exaggerated capabilities to the machine (e.g. conversational systems in elder-care contexts, or toy robots in child care). This poses the question, whether misleading or even actively deceiving the user of an autonomous artifact about the capabilities of the machine is morally bad and why. By analyzing trust, autonomy, and the erosion of trust in communicative acts as consequences of deceptive robot behavior, we formulate four criteria that must be fulfilled in order for robot deception to be morally permissible, and in some cases even morally indicated.",4
1155,Exercising with Baxter: preliminary support for assistive social-physical human-robot interaction,"Background:
        
      
      The worldwide population of older adults will soon exceed the capacity of assisted living facilities. Accordingly, we aim to understand whether appropriately designed robots could help older adults stay active at home.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Building on related literature as well as guidance from experts in game design, rehabilitation, and physical and occupational therapy, we developed eight human-robot exercise games for the Baxter Research Robot, six of which involve physical human-robot contact. After extensive iteration, these games were tested in an exploratory user study including 20 younger adult and 20 older adult users.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Only socially and physically interactive games fell in the highest ranges for pleasantness, enjoyment, engagement, cognitive challenge, and energy level. Our games successfully spanned three different physical, cognitive, and temporal challenge levels. User trust and confidence in Baxter increased significantly between pre- and post-study assessments. Older adults experienced higher exercise, energy, and engagement levels than younger adults, and women rated the robot more highly than men on several survey questions.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The results indicate that social-physical exercise with a robot is more pleasant, enjoyable, engaging, cognitively challenging, and energetic than similar interactions that lack physical touch. In addition to this main finding, researchers working in similar areas can build on our design practices, our open-source resources, and the age-group and gender differences that we found.",5
1156,"Salvage Robot-assisted Renal Surgery for Local Recurrence After Surgical Resection or Renal Mass Ablation: Classification, Techniques, and Clinical Outcomes","Background:
        
      
      Salvage treatment for local recurrence after prior partial nephrectomy (PN) or local tumor ablation (LTA) for kidney cancer is, as of yet, poorly investigated.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To classify the treatments and standardize the nomenclature of salvage robot-assisted renal surgery, to describe the surgical technique for each scenario, and to investigate complications, renal function, and oncologic outcomes.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Sixty-seven patients underwent salvage robot-assisted renal surgery from October 2010 to December 2020 at nine tertiary referral centers.
    


          Surgical procedure:
        
      
      Salvage robot-assisted renal surgery classified according to treatment type as salvage robot-assisted partial or radical nephrectomy (sRAPN or sRARN) and according to previous primary treatment (PN or LTA).
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Postoperative complications, renal function, and oncologic outcomes were assessed.
    


          Results and limitations:
        
      
      A total of 32 and 35 patients underwent salvage robotic surgery following PN and LTA, respectively. After prior PN, two patients underwent sRAPN, while ten underwent sRARN for a metachronous recurrence in the same kidney. No intra- or perioperative complication occurred. For local recurrence in the resection bed, six patients underwent sRAPN, while 14 underwent sRARN. For sRAPN, the intraoperative complication rate was 33%; there was no postoperative complication. For sRARN, there was no intraoperative complication and the postoperative complication rate was 7%. At 3 yr, the local recurrence-free rates were 64% and 82% for sRAPN and sRARN, respectively, while the 3-yr metastasis-free rates were 80% and 79%, respectively. At 33 mo, the median estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were 57 and 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 for sRAPN and sRARN, respectively. After prior LTA, 35 patients underwent sRAPN and no patient underwent sRARN. There was no intraoperative complication; the overall postoperative complications rate was 20%. No local recurrence occurred. The 3-yr metastasis-free rate was 90%. At 43 mo, the median eGFR was 38 ml/min/1.73 m2. The main limitations are the relatively small population and the noncomparative design of the study.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Salvage robot-assisted surgery has a safe complication profile in the hands of experienced surgeons at high-volume institutions, but the risk of local recurrence in this setting is non-negligible.
    


          Patient summary:
        
      
      Patients with local recurrence after partial nephrectomy or local tumor ablation should be aware that further treatment with robot-assisted surgery is not associated with a worrisome complication profile, but also that they are at risk of further recurrence.",2
1157,The Role of Decision Authority and Stated Social Intent as Predictors of Trust in Autonomous Robots,"Prior research has demonstrated that trust in robots and performance of robots are two important factors that influence human-autonomy teaming. However, other factors may influence users' perceptions and use of autonomous systems, such as perceived intent of robots and decision authority of the robots. The current study experimentally examined participants' trust in an autonomous security robot (ASR), perceived trustworthiness of the ASR, and desire to use an ASR that varied in levels of decision authority and benevolence. Participants (N = 340) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results revealed the participants had increased trust in the ASR when the robot was described as having benevolent intent compared to self-protective intent. There were several interactions between decision authority and intent when predicting the trust process, showing that intent may matter the most when the robot has discretion on executing that intent. Participants stated a desire to use the ASR in a military context compared to a public context. Implications for this research demonstrate that as robots become more prevalent in jobs paired with humans, factors such as transparency provided for the robot's intent and its decision authority will influence users' trust and trustworthiness.",4
1158,Robot Guided 'Pen Skill' Training in Children with Motor Difficulties,"Motor deficits are linked to a range of negative physical, social and academic consequences. Haptic robotic interventions, based on the principles of sensorimotor learning, have been shown previously to help children with motor problems learn new movements. We therefore examined whether the training benefits of a robotic system would generalise to a standardised test of 'pen-skills', assessed using objective kinematic measures [via the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool, CKAT]. A counterbalanced, cross-over design was used in a group of 51 children (37 male, aged 5-11 years) with manual control difficulties. Improved performance on a novel task using the robotic device could be attributed to the intervention but there was no evidence of generalisation to any of the CKAT tasks. The robotic system appears to have the potential to support motor learning, with the technology affording numerous advantages. However, the training regime may need to target particular manual skills (e.g. letter formation) in order to obtain clinically significant improvements in specific skills such as handwriting.",6
1159,Trusting Autonomous Security Robots: The Role of Reliability and Stated Social Intent,"Objective:
        
      
      This research examined the effects of reliability and stated social intent on trust, trustworthiness, and one's willingness to endorse use of an autonomous security robot (ASR).
    


          Background:
        
      
      Human-robot interactions in the domain of security is plausible, yet we know very little about what drives acceptance of ASRs. Past research has used static images and game-based simulations to depict the robots versus actual humans interacting with actual robots.
    


          Method:
        
      
      A video depicted an ASR interacting with a human. The ASR reviewed access credentials and allowed entrance once verified. If the ASR could not verify one's credentials it instructed the visitor to return to the security checkpoint. The ASR was equipped with a nonlethal device and the robot used this device on one of the three visitors (a research confederate). Manipulations of reliability and stated social intent of the ASR were used in a 2 × 4 between subjects design (N = 320).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Reliability influenced trust and trustworthiness. Stated social intent influenced trustworthiness. Participants reported being more favorable toward use of the ASR in military contexts versus public contexts.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The study demonstrated that reliability of the ASR and statements regarding the ASR's stated social intent are important considerations influencing the trust process (inclusive of intentions to be vulnerable and trustworthiness perceptions).
    


          Application:
        
      
      If robotic systems are authorized to use force against a human, public acceptance may be increased with availability of the intent-based programming of the robot and whether or not the robot's decision was reliable.",4
1160,Robotic rectal cancer surgery: comparative study of the impact of obesity on early outcomes,"The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) in obese versus non-obese patients.

Patient obesity was not associated with adverse short-term clinical outcomes after robotic rectal cancer surgery. Indicated in the obese perhaps?",2
1161,Trust in Robots: Challenges and Opportunities,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      To assess the state-of-the-art in research on trust in robots and to examine if recent methodological advances can aid in the development of trustworthy robots.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      While traditional work in trustworthy robotics has focused on studying the antecedents and consequences of trust in robots, recent work has gravitated towards the development of strategies for robots to actively gain, calibrate, and maintain the human user's trust. Among these works, there is emphasis on endowing robotic agents with reasoning capabilities (e.g., via probabilistic modeling).
    


          Summary:
        
      
      The state-of-the-art in trust research provides roboticists with a large trove of tools to develop trustworthy robots. However, challenges remain when it comes to trust in real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) settings: there exist outstanding issues in trust measurement, guarantees on robot behavior (e.g., with respect to user privacy), and handling rich multidimensional data. We examine how recent advances in psychometrics, trustworthy systems, robot-ethics, and deep learning can provide resolution to each of these issues. In conclusion, we are of the opinion that these methodological advances could pave the way for the creation of truly autonomous, trustworthy social robots.",4
1162,Robot-Guided Evacuation as a Paradigm for Human-Robot Interaction Research,"This paper conceptualizes the problem of emergency evacuation as a paradigm for investigating human-robot interaction. We argue that emergency evacuation offers unique and important perspectives on human-robot interaction while also demanding close attention to the ethical ramifications of the technologies developed. We present a series of approaches for developing emergency evacuation robots and detail several essential design considerations. This paper concludes with a discussion of the ethical implications of emergency evacuation robots and a roadmap for their development, implementation, and evaluation.",4
1163,Child-Robot Relationship Formation: A Narrative Review of Empirical Research,"This narrative review aimed to elucidate which robot-related characteristics predict relationship formation between typically-developing children and social robots in terms of closeness and trust. Moreover, we wanted to know to what extent relationship formation can be explained by children's experiential and cognitive states during interaction with a robot. We reviewed 86 journal articles and conference proceedings published between 2000 and 2017. In terms of predictors, robots' responsiveness and role, as well as strategic and emotional interaction between robot and child, increased closeness between the child and the robot. Findings about whether robot features predict children's trust in robots were inconsistent. In terms of children's experiential and cognitive states during interaction with a robot, robot characteristics and interaction styles were associated with two experiential states: engagement and enjoyment/liking. The literature hardly addressed the impact of experiential and cognitive states on closeness and trust. Comparisons of children's interactions with robots, adults, and objects showed that robots are perceived as neither animate nor inanimate, and that they are entities with whom children will likely form social relationships. Younger children experienced more enjoyment, were less sensitive to a robot's interaction style, and were more prone to anthropomorphic tendencies and effects than older children. Tailoring a robot's sex to that of a child mainly appealed to boys.",7
1164,Validation of the RobotiX Mentor Robotic Surgery Simulator,"Objectives:
        
      
      To assess face, content, and construct validity of the RobotiX Mentor virtual reality simulator, to assess its acceptability as a robotic surgery training tool and feasibility of its use, and to develop a supplementary training curriculum.
    


          Subjects and methods:
        
      
      This prospective, observational, and comparative study recruited novice (n = 20), intermediate (n = 15), and expert (n = 11) robotic surgeons as participants from institutions across the United Kingdom and at the 30th European Association of Urology Annual Meeting. Each participant completed nine surgical tasks across two modules on the simulator, followed by a questionnaire to evaluate subjective realism (face validity), task importance (content validity), feasibility, and acceptability. Outcome measures of novice, intermediate, and expert groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests to assess construct validity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Construct validity was demonstrated in a total of 17/25 performance evaluation metrics (p < 0.001). Experts performed better than intermediates with regard to time taken to complete the first (p = 0.002) and second (p = 0.043) module, number of instrument collisions (p = 0.040), path length (p = .049), number of cuts >2 mm deep (p = 0.033), average distance from suture target (p = 0.015), and number of suture breakages (p = 0.038). Participants determined both the simulator console and psychomotor tasks as highly realistic (mean: 3.7/5) and important for surgical training (4.5/5), with system pedals (4.2/5) and knot tying task (4.6/5) scoring highest, respectively. The simulator was also rated as an acceptable (4.3/5) tool for training and its use highly feasible (4.3/5).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Construct, face, and content validity was established for the RobotiX Mentor, and feasibility and acceptability of incorporation into surgical training were ascertained. The RobotiX Mentor shows potential as a valuable tool for training and assessment of trainees in robotic skills. Investigation of concurrent and predictive validity is necessary to complete validation, and evaluation of learning curves would provide insight into its value for training.",6
1165,Trends in the diffusion of robotic surgery: A retrospective observational study,"Background:
        
      
      Recent studies have suggested that the use of robotic surgery for prostatectomy has been increasing, but characterization of the diffusion of robotic surgery in other procedures has not been available.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data were analysed for the years 2006-2014 using hospital episode statistics (HES), a database of all admissions to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. OPCS codes were used to determine the annual number of prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy procedures. Concurrent OPCS codes were then used to identify whether these procedures were robotic, conventional laparoscopic or open surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The proportion of robotic cases varied depending on the surgical procedure. Diffusion of robotic surgery was relatively rapid in prostatectomy, moderate in partial nephrectomy, and slow in total abdominal hysterectomy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Although high institutional cost might explain the earliest delays in diffusion, this barrier does not fully account for the different rates of diffusion among surgical procedures.",5
1166,Updated Alternative Fistula Risk Score (ua-FRS) to Include Minimally Invasive Pancreatoduodenectomy: Pan-European Validation,"Objective:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to validate and optimize the alternative Fistula Risk Score (a-FRS) for patients undergoing minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy (MIPD) in a large pan-European cohort.
    


          Background:
        
      
      MIPD may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). The a-FRS could allow for risk-adjusted comparisons in research and improve preventive strategies for high-risk patients. The a-FRS, however, has not yet been validated specifically for laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and hybrid MIPD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A validation study was performed in a pan-European cohort of 952 consecutive patients undergoing MIPD (543 laparoscopic, 258 robot-assisted, 151 hybrid) in 26 centers from 7 countries between 2007 and 2017. The primary outcome was POPF (International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery grade B/C). Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC; discrimination) and calibration plots. Validation included univariable screening for clinical variables that could improve performance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 202 of 952 patients (21%) developed POPF after MIPD. Before adjustment, the original a-FRS performed moderately (AUC 0.68) and calibration was inadequate with systematic underestimation of the POPF risk. Single-row pancreatojejunostomy (odds ratio 4.6, 95 confidence interval [CI] 2.8-7.6) and male sex (odds ratio 1.9, 95 CI 1.4-2.7) were identified as important risk factors for POPF in MIPD. The updated a-FRS, consisting of body mass index, pancreatic texture, duct size, and male sex, showed good discrimination (AUC 0.75, 95 CI 0.71-0.79) and adequate calibration. Performance was adequate for laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and hybrid MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The updated a-FRS (www.pancreascalculator.com) now includes male sex as a risk factor and is validated for both MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy. The increased risk of POPF in laparoscopic MIPD was associated with single-row pancreatojejunostomy, which should therefore be discouraged.",0
1167,"Artificial intelligence, robotics and eye surgery: are we overfitted?","Eye surgery, specifically retinal micro-surgery involves sensory and motor skill that approaches human boundaries and physiological limits for steadiness, accuracy, and the ability to detect the small forces involved. Despite assumptions as to the benefit of robots in surgery and also despite great development effort, numerous challenges to the full development and adoption of robotic assistance in surgical ophthalmology, remain. Historically, the first in-human-robot-assisted retinal surgery occurred nearly 30 years after the first experimental papers on the subject. Similarly, artificial intelligence emerged decades ago and it is only now being more fully realized in ophthalmology. The delay between conception and application has in part been due to the necessary technological advances required to implement new processing strategies. Chief among these has been the better matched processing power of specialty graphics processing units for machine learning. Transcending the classic concept of robots performing repetitive tasks, artificial intelligence and machine learning are related concepts that has proven their abilities to design concepts and solve problems. The implication of such abilities being that future machines may further intrude on the domain of heretofore ""human-reserved"" tasks. Although the potential of artificial intelligence/machine learning is profound, present marketing promises and hype exceeds its stage of development, analogous to the seventieth century mathematical ""boom"" with algebra. Nevertheless robotic systems augmented by machine learning may eventually improve robot-assisted retinal surgery and could potentially transform the discipline. This commentary analyzes advances in retinal robotic surgery, its current drawbacks and limitations, and the potential role of artificial intelligence in robotic retinal surgery.",3
1168,Inguinal hernia TAPP repair using Senhance® robotic platform: first multicenter report from the TRUST registry,"Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of this article was to provide feasibility and safety results of robotic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (Robotic TAPP).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We included 271 cases of robotic inguinal hernia TAPP repair using the Senhance® robotic platform from four different centers between March 2017 and March 2020. Key data points were intraoperative and postoperative complication rate, operating time, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain score and time required to get back to a daily routine that were inserted in the TransEnterix European Patient Registry for Robotic assisted Laparoscopic Procedures in Urology, Abdominal Surgery, Thoracic and Gynecologic Surgery (TRUST).
    


          Results:
        
      
      We report 203 cases of unilateral and 68 cases of bilateral inguinal hernia repairs. Mean operative time was 74 ± 35 min (range 32-265 min), postoperative complications occurred in five (1.85%) cases, the intraoperative complication rate was five (1.85%). The average subjective patient-related pain score after the procedure was 3 ± 1.9 (range 1-9), length of hospital stay was 39 ± 28 h (range 4-288 h), and recovery time was 9.65 ± 8 days (range 1-36 days).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotic inguinal hernia TAPP repair shows inspiring results. It is a safe and doable procedure. However, cost analysis should be performed in future to show the superiority over other techniques.",3
1169,What makes AI 'intelligent' and 'caring'? Exploring affect and relationality across three sites of intelligence and care,"This paper scrutinises how AI and robotic technologies are transforming the relationships between people and machines in new affective, embodied and relational ways. Through investigating what it means to exist as human 'in relation' to AI across health and care contexts, we aim to make three main contributions. (1) We start by highlighting the complexities of philosophical issues surrounding the concepts of ""artificial intelligence"" and ""ethical machines."" (2) We outline some potential challenges and opportunities that the creation of such technologies may bring in the health and care settings. We focus on AI applications that interface with health and care via examples where AI is explicitly designed as an 'augmenting' technology that can overcome human bodily and cognitive as well as socio-economic constraints. We focus on three dimensions of 'intelligence' - physical, interpretive, and emotional - using the examples of robotic surgery, digital pathology, and robot caregivers, respectively. Through investigating these areas, we interrogate the social context and implications of human-technology interaction in the interrelational sphere of care practice. (3) We argue, in conclusion, that there is a need for an interdisciplinary mode of theorising 'intelligence' as relational and affective in ways that can accommodate the fragmentation of both conceptual and material boundaries between human and AI, and human and machine. Our aim in investigating these sociological, philosophical and ethical questions is primarily to explore the relationship between affect, relationality and 'intelligence,' the intersection and integration of 'human' and 'artificial' intelligence, through an examination of how AI is used across different dimensions of intelligence. This allows us to scrutinise how 'intelligence' is ultimately conveyed, understood and (technologically or algorithmically) configured in practice through emerging relationships that go beyond the conceptual divisions between humans and machines, and humans vis-à-vis artificial intelligence-based technologies.",4

      Consecutive patients undergoing iRARC between January 2016 and December 2017 completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item core (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and EORTC-QLQ-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Module (EORTC-QLQ-BLM30) questionnaires before surgery and had a minimum of 12 months follow-up postoperatively.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 76 patients met the inclusion criteria at 12 months. Neobladder (NB) cases (n = 24) were younger (57.0 vs 71.0 years, P < 0.001) and fitter than ileal conduit (IC) cases (n = 52), and had higher physical (100.0 vs 93.3, P = 0.039) and sexual functioning (66.7 vs 50.0, P = 0.013) scores at baseline. Longitudinal analysis of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 showed that physical (NB: 93.3 vs 100.0, P = 0.020; IC: 80.0 vs 93.3, P < 0.001) and role functioning scores (NB: 83.3 vs 100.0, P = 0.010; IC: 83.3 vs 100.0, P = 0.017) decreased and fatigue score (NB: 22.2 vs 11.1, P = 0.026; IC: 33.3 vs 22.2, P = 0.008) increased at 3 months in both diversion groups. Scores returned to baseline at 6 months except physical functioning score in IC patients that remained below baseline until 12 months (86.7 vs 93.3, P = 0.012). The global HRQoL score did not show significant change postoperatively in both groups. A major 90-day Clavien-Dindo complication was a significant predictor (odds ratio [OR] 0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.62; P = 0.012) of deteriorated global HRQoL score at 3 months, while occurrence of a late complication (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.65; P = 0.013) was a predictor of deteriorated global HRQoL score at 12 months. Longitudinal analysis of the EORTC-QLQ-BLM30 showed that urinary problems (NB: 14.3 vs 38.3, P < 0.001; IC: 5.6 vs 19.1, P < 0.001) and future perspective (NB: 33.3 vs 44.4, P = 0.004; IC: 22.2 vs 44.4, P < 0.001) scores were better than baseline at 3 months. Sexual function deteriorated significantly at 3 months (NB: 8.3 vs 66.7, P < 0.001; IC: 4.2 vs 50.0, P < 0.001) and then showed improvement at 12 months but was still below baseline (NB: 33.3 vs 66.7, P = 0.001; IC: 25.0 vs 50.0, P < 0.001). Involvement in penile rehabilitation was shown to be a significant predictor (β 18.62, 95% CI 6.06-30.45; P = 0.005) of higher sexual function score at 12 months.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      While most functional domains and symptoms scales recover to or exceed baseline within 6 months of iRARC, physical function remains below baseline in IC patients up to 12 months. Global HRQoL is preserved for both types of urinary diversion; however, postoperative complications seem to be the main driving factor for global HRQoL. Sexual function is adversely affected after iRARC suggesting that structured rehabilitation of sexual function should be an integral part of the RC pathway.",2
1171,Robotic Dual-Console Distal Pancreatectomy: Could it be Considered a Safe Approach and Surgical Teaching even in Pancreatic Surgery? A Retrospective Observational Study Cohort,"Background:
        
      
      The study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of the robotic dual-console during a robotic distal pancreatectomy METHODS: The data of the consecutive patients submitted to RDP from 2012 to 2019 at the Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients submitted to RDP were divided into the dual-console platform group (DG) and compared to the standard robotic procedure group (SG).
    


          Results:
        
      
      In the study period, 102 robotic distal pancreatectomies were performed, of whom 42 patients (41%) belonged to the DG and 60 patients (59%) to the SG. Higher operation time was recorded in the DG compared to the SG (410 vs. 265 min, p < 0.001). The overall conversion rate of the series was 7% (n 7 patients). All the conversions were observed in the SG (p = 0.021). No differences in morbidity or pancreatic fistula rate were recorded (p > 0.05). No mortality events in the 90th postoperative days were reported in this series.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The robotic dual-console approach for distal pancreatectomy is safe, feasible, and reproducible. The postoperative surgical outcomes are comparable to the standard RDP with the single-console da Vinci Surgical System®. This surgical technique can widely and safely improve the robotic surgical training program.",9
1172,Robotic versus laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy: multicentre analysis,"Background:
        
      
      The role of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy is still unclear, and whether robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) offers benefits over laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) is unknown because large multicentre studies are lacking. This study compared perioperative outcomes between RDP and LDP.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicentre international propensity score-matched study included patients who underwent RDP or LDP for any indication in 21 European centres from six countries that performed at least 15 distal pancreatectomies annually (January 2011 to June 2019). Propensity score matching was based on preoperative characteristics in a 1 : 1 ratio. The primary outcome was the major morbidity rate (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa or above).
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1551 patients (407 RDP and 1144 LDP) were included in the study. Some 402 patients who had RDP were matched with 402 who underwent LDP. After matching, there was no difference between RDP and LDP groups in rates of major morbidity (14.2 versus 16.5 per cent respectively; P = 0.378), postoperative pancreatic fistula grade B/C (24.6 versus 26.5 per cent; P = 0.543) or 90-day mortality (0.5 versus 1.3 per cent; P = 0.268). RDP was associated with a longer duration of surgery than LDP (median 285 (i.q.r. 225-350) versus 240 (195-300) min respectively; P < 0.001), lower conversion rate (6.7 versus 15.2 per cent; P < 0.001), higher spleen preservation rate (81.4 versus 62.9 per cent; P = 0.001), longer hospital stay (median 8.5 (i.q.r. 7-12) versus 7 (6-10) days; P < 0.001) and lower readmission rate (11.0 versus 18.2 per cent; P = 0.004).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The major morbidity rate was comparable between RDP and LDP. RDP was associated with improved rates of conversion, spleen preservation and readmission, to the detriment of longer duration of surgery and hospital stay.",9
1173,Emotion-Driven Analysis and Control of Human-Robot Interactions in Collaborative Applications,"The utilization of robotic systems has been increasing in the last decade. This increase has been derived by the evolvement in the computational capabilities, communication systems, and the information systems of the manufacturing systems which is reflected in the concept of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the robotics systems are continuously required to address new challenges in the industrial and manufacturing domain, like keeping humans in the loop, among other challenges. Briefly, the keeping humans in the loop concept focuses on closing the gap between humans and machines by introducing a safe and trustworthy environment for the human workers to work side by side with robots and machines. It aims at increasing the engagement of the human as the automation level increases rather than replacing the human, which can be nearly impossible in some applications. Consequently, the collaborative robots (Cobots) have been created to allow physical interaction with the human worker. However, these cobots still lack of recognizing the human emotional state. In this regard, this paper presents an approach for adapting cobot parameters to the emotional state of the human worker. The approach utilizes the Electroencephalography (EEG) technology for digitizing and understanding the human emotional state. Afterwards, the parameters of the cobot are instantly adjusted to keep the human emotional state in a desirable range which increases the confidence and the trust between the human and the cobot. In addition, the paper includes a review on technologies and methods for emotional sensing and recognition. Finally, this approach is tested on an ABB YuMi cobot with commercially available EEG headset.",4
1174,Optic Nerve Sheath Fenestration With a Multi-Arm Continuum Robot,"This article presents a medical robotic system for deep orbital interventions, with a focus on Optic Nerve Sheath Fenestration (ONSF). ONSF is a currently invasive ophthalmic surgical approach that can reduce potentially blinding elevated hydrostatic intracranial pressure on the optic disc via an incision on the optic nerve. The prototype is a multi-arm system capable of dexterous manipulation and visualization of the optic nerve area, allowing for a minimally invasive approach. Each arm is an independently controlled concentric tube robot collimated by a bespoke guide that is secured on the eye sclera via sutures. In this article, we consider the robot's end-effector design in order to reach/navigate the optic nerve according to the clinical requirements of ONSF. A prototype of the robot was engineered, and its ability to penetrate the optic nerve was analysed by conducting ex vivo experiments on porcine optic nerves and comparing their stiffness to human ones. The robot was successfully deployed in a custom-made realistic eye phantom. Our simulation studies and experimental results demonstrate that the robot can successfully navigate to the operation site and carry out the intervention.",1
1175,Robotic surgery in emergency setting: 2021 WSES position paper,"Background:
        
      
      Robotics represents the most technologically advanced approach in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Its application in general surgery has increased progressively, with some early experience reported in emergency settings. The present position paper, supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), aims to provide a systematic review of the literature to develop consensus statements about the potential use of robotics in emergency general surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This position paper was conducted according to the WSES methodology. A steering committee was constituted to draft the position paper according to the literature review. An international expert panel then critically revised the manuscript. Each statement was voted through a web survey to reach a consensus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ten studies (3 case reports, 3 case series, and 4 retrospective comparative cohort studies) have been published regarding the applications of robotics for emergency general surgery procedures. Due to the paucity and overall low quality of evidence, 6 statements are proposed as expert opinions. In general, the experts claim for a strict patient selection while approaching emergent general surgery procedures with robotics, eventually considering it for hemodynamically stable patients only. An emergency setting should not be seen as an absolute contraindication for robotic surgery if an adequate training of the operating surgical team is available. In such conditions, robotic surgery can be considered safe, feasible, and associated with surgical outcomes related to an MIS approach. However, there are some concerns regarding the adoption of robotic surgery for emergency surgeries associated with the following: (i) the availability and accessibility of the robotic platform for emergency units and during night shifts, (ii) expected longer operative times, and (iii) increased costs. Further research is necessary to investigate the role of robotic surgery in emergency settings and to explore the possibility of performing telementoring and telesurgery, which are particularly valuable in emergency situations.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Many hospitals are currently equipped with a robotic surgical platform which needs to be implemented efficiently. The role of robotic surgery for emergency procedures remains under investigation. However, its use is expanding with a careful assessment of costs and timeliness of operations. The proposed statements should be seen as a preliminary guide for the surgical community stressing the need for reevaluation and update processes as evidence expands in the relevant literature.",3
1176,Conservative management of urinary incontinence following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy,"Introduction:
        
      
      Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is getting more and more popular becoming the most common radical prostatectomy technique. Unfortunately, a not negligible proportion of patients in whom RARP is performed experience urinary incontinence. We aimed to systematically review the current literature evidence on urinary incontinence conservative treatment after RARP.
    


          Edidence aquisition:
        
      
      A systematic literature review search using PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed in December 2019. PRISMA guidelines have been adopted. Population consisted of patients with urinary incontinence after RARP (P), conservative intervention was considered of interest (I). No comparator was considered mandatory (C). Outcomes of interest were the recovery of continence and quality of life (O).
    


          Evidedence synthesis:
        
      
      Six studies were included. Four of them investigated the use of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). PFMT improved pelvic muscle strength. Continence recovery was faster when guided PFMT was adopted. Moreover, two studies tested the effect of solifenacin on urinary incontinence. One of them, a randomized clinical trial, failed to show shorter time to continence in solifenacin group compared to placebo.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The use of pads is associated with a detrimental effect on quality of life thus active treatments for UI post-RARP are warranted. PFMT has the main advantage to shorten the time for recovery. The use of solifenacin seems to not offer striking advantages in UI following RARP. Future studies should focus on testing the efficacy of these treatments when used after robotic vs. open radical prostatectomy.",2

1178,Robot-assisted vs open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in adults,"Background:
        
      
      It has been suggested that, in comparison with open radical cystectomy (ORC), robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) results in less blood loss, shorter convalescence and fewer complications, with equivalent short-term oncological and functional outcomes; however, uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of these benefits.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To assess the effects of RARC vs ORC in adults with bladder cancer.
    


          Search methods:
        
      
      We conducted a comprehensive search, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared RARC with ORC. The date of the last search was 1 July 2018. Databases searched included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1999 to July 2018), PubMed Embase (1999 to July 2018), Web of Science (1999 to July 2018), Cancer Research UK (www.cancerresearchuk.org/), and the Institute of Cancer Research (www.icr.ac.uk/). We also searched the following trial registers: ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/); BioMed Central International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry (www.isrctn.com); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The review was based on a published protocol. Primary outcomes of the review were recurrence-free survival and major postoperative complications (Clavien grade III to V). Secondary outcomes were minor postoperative complications (Clavien grades I and II), transfusion requirement, length of hospital stay (days), quality of life, and positive surgical margins (%). Three review authors independently assessed relevant titles and abstracts of records identified by the literature search to determine which studies should be assessed further. Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse the data.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We included in the review five RCTs comprising a total of 541 participants. Total numbers of participants included in the ORC and RARC cohorts were 270 and 271, respectively. We found that RARC and ORC may result in a similar time to recurrence (hazard ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.43; two trials, low-certainty evidence). In absolute terms at 5 years of follow-up, this corresponds to 16 more recurrences per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 123 more) with 431 recurrences per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations and imprecision. RARC and ORC may result in similar rates of major complications (risk ratio [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48; five trials, low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 11 more major complications per 1000 participants (95% CI 44 fewer to 89 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations and imprecision. We were very uncertain whether RARC reduces minor complications (very-low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations and very serious imprecision. RARC probably results in substantially fewer transfusions than ORC (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; two trials, moderate-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 193 fewer transfusions per 1000 participants (95% CI 262 fewer to 92 fewer) based on 460 transfusion per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations. RARC may result in a slightly shorter hospital stay than ORC (mean difference -0.67, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.12; five trials, low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations and imprecision. RARC and ORC may result in a similar quality of life (standardized mean difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.32 lower to 0.16 higher; three trials, low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations and imprecision. RARC and ORC may result in similar positive surgical margin rates (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.40; five trials, low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to eight more (95% CI 21 fewer to 67 more) positive surgical margins per 1000 participants, based on 48 positive surgical margins per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations and imprecision.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We conclude that RARC and ORC may have similar outcomes with regard to time to recurrence, rates of major complications, quality of life, and positive surgical margin rates (all low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether the robotic approach reduces rates of minor complications (very-low-certainty evidence), although it probably reduces the risk of blood transfusions substantially (moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce hospital stay slightly (low-certainty evidence). We were unable to conduct any of the preplanned subgroup analyses to assess the impact of patient age, pathological stage, body habitus, or surgeon expertise on outcomes. This review did not address issues of cost-effectiveness.",2
1179,Articulated Multi-Instrument 2-D Pose Estimation Using Fully Convolutional Networks,"Instrument detection, pose estimation, and tracking in surgical videos are an important vision component for computer-assisted interventions. While significant advances have been made in recent years, articulation detection is still a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network for articulated multi-instrument 2-D pose estimation, which is trained on detailed annotations of endoscopic and microscopic data sets. Our model is formed by a fully convolutional detection-regression network. Joints and associations between joint pairs in our instrument model are located by the detection subnetwork and are subsequently refined through a regression subnetwork. Based on the output from the model, the poses of the instruments are inferred using maximum bipartite graph matching. Our estimation framework is powered by deep learning techniques without any direct kinematic information from a robot. Our framework is tested on single-instrument RMIT data, and also on multi-instrument EndoVis and in vivo data with promising results. In addition, the data set annotations are publicly released along with our code and model.",1
1180,Would a robot trust you? Developmental robotics model of trust and theory of mind,"Trust is a critical issue in human-robot interactions: as robotic systems gain complexity, it becomes crucial for them to be able to blend into our society by maximizing their acceptability and reliability. Various studies have examined how trust is attributed by people to robots, but fewer have investigated the opposite scenario, where a robot is the trustor and a human is the trustee. The ability for an agent to evaluate the trustworthiness of its sources of information is particularly useful in joint task situations where people and robots must collaborate to reach shared goals. We propose an artificial cognitive architecture based on the developmental robotics paradigm that can estimate the trustworthiness of its human interactors for the purpose of decision making. This is accomplished using Theory of Mind (ToM), the psychological ability to assign to others beliefs and intentions that can differ from one's owns. Our work is focused on a humanoid robot cognitive architecture that integrates a probabilistic ToM and trust model supported by an episodic memory system. We tested our architecture on an established developmental psychological experiment, achieving the same results obtained by children, thus demonstrating a new method to enhance the quality of human and robot collaborations. This article is part of the theme issue 'From social brains to social robots: applying neurocognitive insights to human-robot interaction'.",4
1181,Functional Brain States Measure Mentor-Trainee Trust during Robot-Assisted Surgery,"Mutual trust is important in surgical teams, especially in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) where interaction with robot-assisted interface increases the complexity of relationships within the surgical team. However, evaluation of trust between surgeons is challenging and generally based on subjective measures. Mentor-Trainee trust was defined as assessment of mentor on trainee's performance quality and approving trainee's ability to continue performing the surgery. Here, we proposed a novel method of objectively assessing mentor-trainee trust during RAS based on patterns of brain activity of surgical mentor observing trainees. We monitored the EEG activity of a mentor surgeon while he observed procedures performed by surgical trainees and quantified the mentor's brain activity using functional and cognitive brain state features. We used methods from machine learning classification to identity key features that distinguish trustworthiness from concerning performances. Results showed that during simple surgical task, functional brain features are sufficient to classify trust. While, during more complex tasks, the addition of cognitive features could provide additional accuracy, but functional brain state features drive classification performance. These results indicate that functional brain network interactions hold information that may help objective trainee specific mentorship and aid in laying the foundation of automation in the human-robot shared control environment during RAS.",4
1182,Physiological and perceptual consequences of trust in collaborative robots: An empirical investigation of human and robot factors,"Measuring trust is an important element of effective human-robot collaborations (HRCs). It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.",4
1183,A Critical Analysis of the Learning Curve and Postlearning Curve Outcomes of Two Experience- and Volume-Matched Surgeons for Laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,"Background and purpose:
        
      
      There remains equipoise with regard to whether laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has any benefit over the other. Despite this, there is a trend for the increasing adoption of RARP at great cost to health services across the world. The aim was to critically analyze the learning curve and outcomes for LRP and RARP for two experience- and volume-matched surgeons who have completed the learning curve for LRP and RARP.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Two experience- and volume-matched LRP and RARP surgeons who have completed the learning curve were compared with respect to their learning curve and outcomes for RARP and LRP. There were 531 RARP and 550 LRPs analyzed from April 2003 until January 2012 at two relatively high-volume United Kingdom centers. Outcome measures included operative time, blood loss, complication rate (Clavien-Dindo grade III), positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, and early continence rate.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Learning curves for blood loss, operative times, and complication rate were similar between groups. The overall PSM rate and pT2 PSM rate learning curves were longer for RARP compared with LRP but shorter for early continence. Apical PSM showed no learning curve for RARP; however, a long learning curve for LRP and the rate was lower for RARP than for LRP (P=<0.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This study of RARP and LRP identified that both modalities had long learning curves. Despite the long learning curve for RARP, significant benefits in lower PSM rates and better early continence in comparison with LRP exist. There are benefits to patients with RARP over LRP, especially those linked to better apical dissection (apical PSM and early continence).",2
1184,Hip Joint Torsional Loading Before and After Cam Femoroacetabular Impingement Surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Surgical management of cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) aims to preserve the native hip and restore joint function, although it is unclear how the capsulotomy, cam deformity, and capsular repair influence joint mechanics to balance functional mobility.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To examine the contributions of the capsule and cam deformity to hip joint mechanics. Using in vitro, cadaveric methods, we examined the individual effects of the surgical capsulotomy, cam resection, and capsular repair on passive range of motion and resistance of applied torque.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Descriptive laboratory study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Twelve cadaveric hips with cam deformities were skeletonized to the capsule and mounted onto a robotic testing platform. The robot positioned each intact hip in multiple testing positions: (1) extension, (2) neutral 0°, (3) flexion 30°, (4) flexion 90°, (5) flexion-adduction and internal rotation (FADIR), and (6) flexion-abduction and external rotation. Then the robot performed applicable internal and external rotations, recording the neutral path of motion until a 5-N·m of torque was reached in each rotational direction. Each hip then underwent a series of surgical stages (T-capsulotomy, cam resection, capsular repair) and was retested to reach 5 N·m of internal and external torque again after each stage. During the capsulotomy and cam resection stages, the initial intact hip's recorded path of motion was replayed to measure changes in resisted torque.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Regarding changes in motion, external rotation increased substantially after capsulotomies, but internal rotation only further increased at flexion 90° (change +32%, P = .001, d = 0.58) and FADIR (change +33%, P < .001, d = 0.51) after cam resections. Capsular repair provided marginal restraint for internal rotation but restrained the external rotation compared with the capsulotomy stage. Regarding changes in torque, both internal and external torque resistance decreased after capsulotomy. Compared with the capsulotomy stage, cam resection further reduced internal torque resistance during flexion 90° (change -45%, P < .001, d = 0.98) and FADIR (change -37%, P = .003, d = 1.0), where the cam deformity accounted for 21% of the intact hip's torsional resistance in flexion 90° and 27% in FADIR.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Although the capsule played a predominant role in joint constraint, the cam deformity provided 21% to 27% of the intact hip's resistance to torsional load in flexion and internal rotation. Resecting the cam deformity would remove this loading on the chondrolabral junction.

      These findings are the first to quantify the contribution of the cam deformity to resisting hip joint torsional loads and thus quantify the reduced loading on the chondrolabral complex that can be achieved after cam resection.",3
1185,Three-Degree-of-Freedom MR-Compatible Multisegment Cardiac Catheter Steering Mechanism,"This paper presents a novel MR-compatible 3-DOF cardiac catheter steering mechanism. The catheter's steerable structure is tendon driven and consists of miniature deflectable, helical segments created by a precise rapid prototyping technique. The created catheter prototype has an outer diameter of 9 Fr (3 mm) and a steerable distal end that can be deflected in a 3-D space via four braided high-tensile Spectra fiber tendons. Any longitudinal twist commonly observed in helical structures is compensated for by employing clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) helical segments in an alternating fashion. A 280 μm flexible carbon fiber rod is used as a backbone in a central channel to improve the structure's steering and positioning repeatability. In addition to the backbone, a carbon fiber tube can be inserted into the structure to a varying amount capable of changing the structure's forcibility and, thus, providing a means to change the curvature and to modify the deflectable length of the catheter leading to an extension of reachable points in the catheter-tip workspace. A unique feature of this helical segment structure is that the stiffness can be further adjusted by appropriately tensioning tendons simultaneously. An experimental study has been conducted examining the catheter-tip trajectory in a 3-D space and its positioning repeatability using a 5-DOF magnetic coil tracking system. Furthermore, MRI experiments in a 1.5-T scanner confirmed the MR-compatibility of the catheter prototype. The study shows that the proposed concept for catheter steering has great potential to be employed for robotically steered and MR-guided cardiac catheterization.",0
1186,Robotics in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery: a critical review of existing systems and proposed specifications for new robotic platforms,"Background:
        
      
      Over the past decade, advances in image guidance, endoscopy, and tube-shaft instruments have allowed for the further development of keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery, utilizing smaller craniotomies and minimizing exposure and manipulation of unaffected brain tissue. Although such approaches offer the possibility of shorter operating times, reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved long-term outcomes, the technical skills required to perform such surgery are inevitably greater than for traditional open surgical techniques, and they have not been widely adopted by neurosurgeons. Surgical robotics, which has the ability to improve visualization and increase dexterity, therefore has the potential to enhance surgical performance.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the role of surgical robots in keyhole transcranial endoscope-assisted microsurgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The technical challenges faced by surgeons utilizing keyhole craniotomies were reviewed, and a thorough appraisal of presently available robotic systems was performed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Surgical robotic systems have the potential to incorporate advances in augmented reality, stereoendoscopy, and jointed-wrist instruments, and therefore to significantly impact the field of keyhole neurosurgery. To date, over 30 robotic systems have been applied to neurosurgical procedures. The vast majority of these robots are best described as supervisory controlled, and are designed for stereotactic or image-guided surgery. Few telesurgical robots are suitable for keyhole neurosurgical approaches, and none are in widespread clinical use in the field.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      New robotic platforms in minimally invasive neurosurgery must possess clear and unambiguous advantages over conventional approaches if they are to achieve significant clinical penetration.",1
1187,Development and validation of a robotic system for ankle joint testing,"Ankle sprains are the most common sports injury. Gaining a better understanding of ankle mechanics will help improve current treatments, enabling a better quality of life for patients following surgery. In this paper, the development of a robotic system for ankle joint testing is presented. It is composed of an industrial robot, a universal force/torque sensor and bespoke holders allowing high repositioning of specimens. A specimen preparation protocol that uses optical tracking to register the ankle specimens is used. A registration technique is applied to define and calibrate the task related coordinate system needed to control the joint's degrees of freedom and to simulate standardised, clinical ankle laxity tests. Experiments were carried out at different flexion angles using the robotic platform. Optical tracking was used to record the resulting motion of the tibia for every simulated test. The measurements from the optical tracker and the robot were compared and used to validate the system. These findings showed that the optical tracking measurements validate those from the robot for ankle joint testing with interclass coefficients equal to 0.991, 0.996 and 0.999 for the anterior-posterior translations, internal-external and inversion-eversion rotations.",0
1188,Effective implementation and adaptation of structured robotic colorectal programme in a busy tertiary unit,"Background:
        
      
      Safety and feasibility of robotic colorectal surgery has been reported as increasing over the last decade. However safe implementation and adaptation of such a programme with comparable morbidities and acceptable oncological outcomes remains a challenge in a busy tertiary unit. We present our experience of implementation and adaptation of a structured robotic colorectal programme in a high-volume center in the United Kingdom.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Two colorectal surgeons underwent a structured robotic colorectal training programme consisting of time on simulation console, dry and wet laboratory courses, case observation, and initial mentoring. Data were collected on consecutive robotic colorectal cancer resections over a period of 12 months and compared with colorectal cancer resections data of the same surgeons' record prior to the adaptation of the new technique. Patient demographics including age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologist score (ASA), Clavien-Dindo grading, previous abdominal surgeries, and BMI were included. Short-term outcomes including conversion to open, length of stay, return to theatre, 30- and 90-days mortality, blood loss, and post-operative analgesia were recorded. Tumour site, TNM staging, diverting stoma, neo-adjuvant therapy, total mesorectal excision (TME) grading and positive resection margins (R1) were compared. p values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Ninety colorectal cancer resections were performed with curative intent from June 2018 to June 2020. Thirty robotic colorectal cancer resections (RCcR) were performed after adaption of programme and were compared with 60 non-robotic colorectal cancer resections (N-RCcR) prior to implementation of technique. There was no conversion in the RCcR group; however, in N-RCcR group, five had open resection from start and the rest had laparoscopic surgery. In laparoscopic group, there were six (10.9%) conversions to open (two adhesions, three multi-visceral involvements, one intra-operative bleed). Male-to-female ratio was 20:09 in RCcR group and 33:20 in N-RCcR groups. No significant differences in gender (p = 0.5), median age (p = 0.47), BMI (p = 0.64) and ASA scores (p = 0.72) were present in either groups. Patient characteristics between the two groups were comparable aside from an increased proportion of rectal and sigmoid cancers in RCcR group. Mean operating time, and returns to theaters were comparable in both groups. Complications were fewer in RCcR group as compared to N-RCcR (16.6% vs 25%). RCcR group patients have reduced length of stay (5 days vs 7 days) but this is not statistically significant. Estimated blood loss and conversion to open surgery was significantly lesser in the robotic group (p < 0.01). The oncological outcomes from surgery including TNM, resection margin status, lymph node yield and circumferential resection margin (for rectal cancers) were all comparable. There was no 30-day mortality in either group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Implementation and integration of robotic colorectal surgery is safe and effective in a busy tertiary center through a structured training programme with comparable short-term survival and oncological outcomes during learning curve.",9
1189,Deep learning-based monocular placental pose estimation: towards collaborative robotics in fetoscopy,"Purpose:
        
      
      Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a placental defect occurring in monochorionic twin pregnancies. It is associated with high risks of fetal loss and perinatal death. Fetoscopic elective laser ablation (ELA) of placental anastomoses has been established as the most effective therapy for TTTS. Current tools and techniques face limitations in case of more complex ELA cases. Visualization of the entire placental surface and vascular equator; maintaining an adequate distance and a close to perpendicular angle between laser fiber and placental surface are central for the effectiveness of laser ablation and procedural success. Robot-assisted technology could address these challenges, offer enhanced dexterity and ultimately improve the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic procedures.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This work proposes a 'minimal' robotic TTTS approach whereby rather than deploying a massive and expensive robotic system, a compact instrument is 'robotised' and endowed with 'robotic' skills so that operators can quickly and efficiently use it. The work reports on automatic placental pose estimation in fetoscopic images. This estimator forms a key building block of a proposed shared-control approach for semi-autonomous fetoscopy. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict the relative orientation of the placental surface from a single monocular fetoscope camera image. To overcome the absence of real-life ground-truth placenta pose data, similar to other works in literature (Handa et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2016; Gaidon et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2016; Vercauteren et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE, 2019) the network is trained with data generated in a simulated environment and an in-silico phantom model. A limited set of coarsely manually labeled samples from real interventions are added to the training dataset to improve domain adaptation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The trained network shows promising results on unseen samples from synthetic, phantom and in vivo patient data. The performance of the network for collaborative control purposes was evaluated in a virtual reality simulator in which the virtual flexible distal tip was autonomously controlled by the neural network.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Improved alignment was established compared to manual operation for this setting, demonstrating the feasibility to incorporate a CNN-based estimator in a real-time shared control scheme for fetoscopic applications.",0
1190,"Design and Integration of a Parallel, Soft Robotic End-Effector for Extracorporeal Ultrasound","Objective:
        
      
      In this work we address limitations in state-of-the-art ultrasound robots by designing and integrating a novel soft robotic system for ultrasound imaging. It employs the inherent qualities of soft fluidic actuators to establish safe, adaptable interaction between ultrasound probe and patient.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We acquire clinical data to determine the movement ranges and force levels required in prenatal foetal ultrasound imaging and design the soft robotic end-effector accordingly. We verify its mechanical characteristics, derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate controllability and imaging capabilities on an ultrasound phantom.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The soft robot exhibits the desired stiffness characteristics and is able to reach 100% of the required workspace when no external force is present, and 95% of the workspace when considering its compliance. The model can accurately predict the end-effector pose with a mean error of 1.18±0.29 mm in position and 0.92±0.47° in orientation. The derived controller is, with an average position error of 0.39 mm, able to track a target pose efficiently without and with externally applied loads. Ultrasound images acquired with the system are of equally good quality compared to a manual sonographer scan.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The system is able to withstand loads commonly applied during foetal ultrasound scans and remains controllable with a motion range similar to manual scanning.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      The proposed soft robot presents a safe, cost-effective solution to offloading sonographers in day-to-day scanning routines. The design and modelling paradigms are greatly generalizable and particularly suitable for designing soft robots for physical interaction tasks.",0

1192,Robot-Assisted Reconstruction in Head and Neck Surgical Oncology: The Evolving Role of the Reconstructive Microsurgeon,"Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is gaining more widespread use among head and neck surgical procedures. As experience grows with this technique, so do the indications of when and in which patients it can be used. Already established in the treatment of small oral cavity tumours, it is expanding into larger multi-site resections and resections, such as through-and-through-into-the-neck defects, that will require reconstruction. With robot-assisted surgery advancing, so robot-assisted reconstruction (RAR) is evolving. In this paper, we discuss the evolving role of reconstruction in post-TORS defects as well as the role of RAR in today's practice.",0

1194,Comparison of FreeHand® robot-assisted with human-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare the safety, operative time and feasibilty of FreeHand® robot (FreeHand Ltd, Guildford, United Kingdom) with manual camera control approach for Laparoscopic Fundoplication.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      A case control study was performed for patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication. Primary outcome was operative time; secondary outcomes included length of stay, post-operative morbidity, symptoms at first follow-up and total post-operative out-patient visits.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Forty-four patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication between January 2014 and June 2016. Twenty-six (59%) underwent conventional human-assisted fundoplication while 18 (41%) had FreeHand® robot assisted procedures. Mean operative time for conventional laparoscopic fundoplication was 165 min compared with 129 min in the robot-assisted group, saving 36 min (p < .001).The median length of stay was 1.5 days in the robot-assisted as compared to two days in the conventional group. Sixteen percent of robot-assisted as opposed to 30% of conventional group patients experienced complications. There was no 30-day mortality. Two patients required more than one post-operative clinic visit in robot-assisted against six in conventional group.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robot-assisted fundoplication is safe, feasible and reduces operative time. Furthermore, this negates need of assistant. Mean operative time for robot-assisted fundoplication was 36 min less than for conventional fundoplication. Advantages also include fewer adverse events, shorter length of stay and less post-operative clinic visits.",1
1195,Investigating cooperation with robotic peers,"We explored how people establish cooperation with robotic peers, by giving participants the chance to choose whether to cooperate or not with a more/less selfish robot, as well as a more or less interactive, in a more or less critical environment. We measured the participants' tendency to cooperate with the robot as well as their perception of anthropomorphism, trust and credibility through questionnaires. We found that cooperation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) follows the same rule of Human-Human Interaction (HHI), participants rewarded cooperation with cooperation, and punished selfishness with selfishness. We also discovered two specific robotic profiles capable of increasing cooperation, related to the payoff. A mute and non-interactive robot is preferred with a high payoff, while participants preferred a more human-behaving robot in conditions of low payoff. Taken together, these results suggest that proper cooperation in HRI is possible but is related to the complexity of the task.",4
1196,Gesture Recognition in Robotic Surgery: A Review,"Objective:
        
      
      Surgical activity recognition is a fundamental step in computer-assisted interventions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in methods for automatic recognition of fine-grained gestures in robotic surgery focusing on recent data-driven approaches and outlines the open questions and future research directions.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      An article search was performed on 5 bibliographic databases with the following search terms: robotic, robot-assisted, JIGSAWS, surgery, surgical, gesture, fine-grained, surgeme, action, trajectory, segmentation, recognition, parsing. Selected articles were classified based on the level of supervision required for training and divided into different groups representing major frameworks for time series analysis and data modelling.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 52 articles were reviewed. The research field is showing rapid expansion, with the majority of articles published in the last 4 years. Deep-learning-based temporal models with discriminative feature extraction and multi-modal data integration have demonstrated promising results on small surgical datasets. Currently, unsupervised methods perform significantly less well than the supervised approaches.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The development of large and diverse open-source datasets of annotated demonstrations is essential for development and validation of robust solutions for surgical gesture recognition. While new strategies for discriminative feature extraction and knowledge transfer, or unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, can mitigate the need for data and labels, they have not yet been demonstrated to achieve comparable performance. Important future research directions include detection and forecast of gesture-specific errors and anomalies.

      This paper is a comprehensive and structured analysis of surgical gesture recognition methods aiming to summarize the status of this rapidly evolving field.",1
1197,A robot goes to rehab: a novel gamified system for long-term stroke rehabilitation using a socially assistive robot-methodology and usability testing,"Background:
        
      
      Socially assistive robots (SARs) have been proposed as a tool to help individuals who have had a stroke to perform their exercise during their rehabilitation process. Yet, to date, there are no data on the motivating benefit of SARs in a long-term interaction with post-stroke patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Here, we describe a robot-based gamified exercise platform, which we developed for long-term post-stroke rehabilitation. The platform uses the humanoid robot Pepper, and also has a computer-based configuration (with no robot). It includes seven gamified sets of exercises, which are based on functional tasks from the everyday life of the patients. The platform gives the patients instructions, as well as feedback on their performance, and can track their performance over time. We performed a long-term patient-usability study, where 24 post-stroke patients were randomly allocated to exercise with this platform-either with the robot or the computer configuration-over a 5-7 week period, 3 times per week, for a total of 306 sessions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The participants in both groups reported that this rehabilitation platform addressed their arm rehabilitation needs, and they expressed their desire to continue training with it even after the study ended. We found a trend for higher acceptance of the system by the participants in the robot group on all parameters; however, this difference was not significant. We found that system failures did not affect the long-term trust that users felt towards the system.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We demonstrated the usability of using this platform for a long-term rehabilitation with post-stroke patients in a clinical setting. We found high levels of acceptance of both platform configurations by patients following this interaction, with higher ratings given to the SAR configuration. We show that it is not the mere use of technology that increases the motivation of the person to practice, but rather it is the appreciation of the technology's effectiveness and its perceived contribution to the rehabilitation process. In addition, we provide a list of guidelines that can be used when designing and implementing other technological tools for rehabilitation.

1198,Patient-reported outcomes and urodynamic findings in men with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy,"Aims:
        
      
      To evaluate the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and urodynamic findings in men seeking intervention for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in a regional referral center for continence surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Consecutive men with post-RARP LUTS, who were referred for specialist evaluation and urodynamics between December 2012 and October 2017, were evaluated. Men were invited to complete the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire on Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Long Form (ICIQ-MLUTS) pre-operatively and at 6, 12 and 18 months post-RARP.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total 64/860 (7.4%) men post-RARP were referred for specialist evaluation. There was a significant increase in total ICIQ-MLUTS and bother scores at 6, 12 and 18 months compared with the baseline in these men (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Urodynamics identified 41/64 (64%) had urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) only, 2/64 (3%) had detrusor overactivity (DO) only and 11/64 (17%) had a combination of USI and DO. Of those referred to a continence specialist 29/64 (45%) underwent a continence procedure.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with bothersome LUTS post-RARP have higher baseline ICIQ-MLUTs scores and significant worsening of total scores at all time points compared with the baseline. Routine use of PROMs may identify patients at risk of bothersome symptoms after RARP and prompt earlier referral for further management of their LUTS. Urodynamic evaluation revealed that the most common finding was pure stress incontinence but the range of urodynamic diagnoses highlights the need to perform urodynamics before making treatment decisions for men with LUTS post-RARP.",2
1199,Factors affecting trust in high-vulnerability human-robot interaction contexts: A structural equation modelling approach,"The current research proposed and tested a structural equation model (SEM) that describes hypothesized relationships among factors affecting trust in human-robot interaction (HRI) such as trustworthiness, human-likeness, intelligence, perfect automation schema (PAS), and affect. A video stimulus depicting an autonomous guard robot interacting with humans was employed as a stimulus via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to recruit 233 participants. Human-related and robot-related metrics were found to affect trustworthiness that subsequently affected trust. In particular, ability (as a trustworthiness facet) was a dominant factor affecting trust in HRI. Integrity was found to mediate the relationships between robot- and human-related metrics and trustworthiness. This study also showed a correlation between intelligence and trustworthiness, as well as between PAS and trustworthiness. The findings of the present study have significant implications for both theory and practice on factors and levels that affect trust in HRI.",4

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public-private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public-private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.",3
1201,Latest Advances in Robot-Assisted Knee Arthroplasty,"In the longstanding pursuit of improving alignment and functional outcome in knee arthroplasty, technological evolution leading to robotic systems has now been introduced to the mainstream orthopaedic surgical world. This technology facilitates greater accuracy in implant placement, protects soft tissues, and achieves better balancing, while also allowing the potential to be more bone conserving. Robots currently in use in orthopaedic surgery can be classified into passive or haptic semi-active surgeon-guided systems. Using a virtual model of the knee joint, the robot system guides bone cuts and facilitates precise implant placement. In addition, small changes to bone resection can be made permitting deformity correction and balancing. This is achieved on-table by dynamic referencing, which enables live objective measurement of range of movements, stability, and gap balance throughout the range of motion. Preservation of ligaments and their unnecessary releases has been shown to reduce time to recovery and allow potentially better knee kinematics. Advances in robot technology in knee arthroplasty have led to the development of a variety of systems to execute the multiple steps in this procedure including using computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, plain radiographs (image based), or image-free systems. The combination of these images and on-table registering of bony landmarks allow the creation of a 3-dimensional (3D) virtual, but accurate, model of the knee during surgery. The various systems apply sculpting tools, burrs, or cutting saws to deliver the bone cuts or allow robots to guide placement of cutting blocks to ensure accurate pre-planned bone cuts. Intraoperative adjustments to bone resections can be made using a variety of tracker systems to measure joint movement and ligament balance to correct any malalignments while performing the surgery, so compound errors in the technique are avoided. Data from comparative studies suggest improved accuracy in implant placement in patients compared to conventional knee arthroplasty. Benefits of robot assistance have been demonstrated both in total knee arthroplasty and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Recent studies show a trend toward improved patient-reported outcomes and better patient satisfactions as well as earlier recoveries following robot-assisted knee arthroplasty. Early survivorship data has also shown a better survivorship with robot-assisted knee arthroplasty, although long-term survivorship data are awaited. An increase in familiarity, availability, and demand for this technology is driving innovations aimed at delivering a personalized approach to knee arthroplasty. This chapter will discuss the latest advances and look at the clinical research in relation to the robotic technological advancement comparing some of the different system approaches.",0

          Methods:
        
      
      A SWOT analysis to understand the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of robotic technology in palliative and supportive care.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The opportunities of robotics in palliative, supportive and end-of-life care include a number of assistive, therapeutic, social and educational uses. However, there are a number of technical, societal, economic and ethical factors which need to be considered to ensure meaningful use of this technology in palliative care.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Robotics could have a number of potential applications in palliative, supportive and end-of-life care. Future work should evaluate the health-related, economic, societal and ethical implications of using this technology. There is a need for collaborative research to establish use-cases and inform policy, to ensure the appropriate use (or non-use) of robots for people with serious illness.",3
1204,"Robotic or open radical cystectomy, which is safer? A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies","Robotic radical cystectomy (RRC) has been growing in popularity across the world as a treatment option for bladder cancer.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To compare early surgical outcomes for RRC and open radical cystectomy (ORC) with an emphasis on complications and postoperative mortality rates.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      A literature review was conducted from 2000 to 2013, including studies comparing RRC and ORC. The main outcome measures analyzed were the complications and mortality rates, in addition to patient demographics, pathological parameters, operating time, estimated blood loss (EBL), transfusion rates, and type of urinary diversion. A meta-analysis was conducted. For continuous data, the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used, and for dichotomous data, inverse variance was used and each expressed as risk ratio with 95% CI.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 748 patients were included, 461 patients in the robotic group and 287 patients in the open group (seven studies). There were no significant differences in the demographic parameters of the two groups, except for age (age: p=0.03). There was no difference in the number of muscle-invasive diseases: p=0.47. No difference in positive surgical margin rates (p=0.21).
    


          Primary outcomes:
        
      
      The overall (p=0.32) and lower grade (Clavien I-II) (p=0.10) complication rates between the two cohorts did not achieve statistical significance. The high-grade (Clavien III-IV) (p=0.007) complication rates in the ORC group were significantly higher. The mortality rate (Clavien V) was higher in the ORC group (2.2%) compared with the RRC group (0.35%) and this did achieve statistical significance on a meta-analysis (p=0.04).
    


          Secondary outcomes:
        
      
      The EBL and transfusion rates were statistically significantly lower in the RRC cohort (p<0.00001). The operating time was statistically significantly higher in the RRC cohort (p<0.00001). There was no statistically significant difference in the margin positivity between the two cohorts (p=0.08).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In early experience, RRC appears to be feasible and a safe alternative to the ORC. RRC appears to have lower high-grade complications and mortality rates compared with the open approach. Although these results are promising, the authors would suggest caution while interpreting these results due to concerns with methodological flaws in the included studies in this review.",2
1205,Cost-effectiveness and quality of life analysis of laparoscopic and robotic distal pancreatectomy: a propensity score-matched study,"Background:
        
      
      This study analyzed the Quality of Life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic (LDP) versus robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP).
    


          Method:
        
      
      All patients who underwent LDP or RDP from 2011 to 2017 and with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 12 months were included in the study. To minimize bias, a propensity score-matched analysis (1:2) was performed. Two different questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D) were completed by the patients. The mean differential cost and mean differential Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) were calculated and plotted on a cost-utility plane.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study population consisted of 152 patients. After having applied the propensity score matching, the final population included 103 patients divided into RDP group (n = 37, 36%) and LDP (n = 66, 64%). No differences were found between groups regarding the baseline, intraoperative, postoperative, and pathological variables (p > 0.05). The QoL analysis showed a significant improvement in the RDP group on the postoperative social function, nausea, vomiting, and financial status (p = 0.010, p = 0.050, and p = 0.030, respectively). As expected, the crude costs analysis confirmed that RDP was more expensive than LDP (12,053 Euros vs. 5519 Euros, p < 0.001). However, the robotic approach had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than the laparoscopic procedure when a willingness to pay of more than 4800 Euros/QALY was accepted.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RDP was associated with QoL improvement in specific domains. Crude costs were higher relative to LDP. Cost-effectiveness threshold resulted to be 4800 euros/QALY. The increasing worldwide diffusion of the robotic technology, with easier access and possible cost reduction, could increase the sustainability of this procedure.",5
1206,Is remote live urologic surgery a reality? Evidences from a systematic review of the literature,"Introduction and objectives:
        
      
      The possibility of performing remote-surgery has been the goal to achieve, since the early development of the first surgical robotic platforms. This systematic review aims to analyse the state of the art in the field and to provide an overview of the possible growth of this technology.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      All English language publications on Telementoring and Telesurgery for minimally invasive urologic procedures were evaluated. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) statement to evaluate PubMed®, Scopus®, and Web of Science™ databases (up to June 2019).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Our electronic search identified a total of 124 papers in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Of these, 81 publications were identified for detailed review, which yielded 22 included in the present systematic review. Our results showed that remote surgery has been under-utilised until today, mostly due to the lack of appropriate telecommunication technologies.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Remote live surgery is a growing technology that is catalyzing incremental interest. Despite not being yet reliable today on a regular basis in its most advanced applications, thanks to the advent of novel data-transmission technologies, telepresence might become a critical educational methodology, highly impacting the global healthcare system.",1
1207,Perioperative impact of body mass index on upper urinary tract and renal robot-assisted surgery: a single high-volume centre experience,"To assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on peri-operative outcomes of kidney and upper tract robot-assisted surgery. Medical audit of patients who underwent robot-assisted kidney and upper tract cancer surgery at a single institution between 2017 and 2019, categorized on BMI into obese patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and a control group with BMI < 25 kg/m2. Patient and tumour characteristics, surgery time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative adverse events (AE) according to the European Association of Urology Intraoperative Adverse Incidents Classification (EAUiaiC), conversion- to-open/radical rate as well as 30-day postoperative AE according to Clavien-Dindo (CD) and length of inpatient stay were analyzed. 366 patients were identified, 141 with a BMI < 25 (normal-weight) and 225 BMI ≥ 30 (obesity). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, tumour size, TNM stage and type of surgery. Obese patients had a higher estimated blood loss (198.05 ml), surgery time (171.75 min), intraoperative AE (all grades) (14.67%, 95% CI (0.10-0.19) as well as adherent perinephric fat (APF) (14.22%, 95% CI (0.09-0.19)) in contrast to the control group (86.85 ml, 148.29 min, 7.04% and 2.12%, respectively). Hospital stay, major intraoperative AE (≥ 3) and major postoperative AE (CD > 2) distributed equally between groups. Robotic kidney and upper tract surgery in obese patients showed an increase in surgery time and blood loss potentially related to APF. However, obesity was not associated with conversion to open surgery or radical nephrectomy in nephron-sparing procedures, length of stay, major intraoperative AE or postoperative complications.",9
1208,Large bilateral seminal vesicle calculi presenting with spermolithiasis,"A 34-year-old male presented with an 8-month history of passing increasingly painful 'grit' in his ejaculate. Semen analysis was normal as were urinary and blood tests. T1-weighted MRI revealed several bilateral high-signal areas measuring up to 1 cm in diameter, located in the seminal vesicles. These were confirmed as calculi on T2-weighted imaging and a seminal vesiculogram, with no drainage from the left ejaculatory duct and only minimal from the right duct. He is currently awaiting a robot-assisted laparoscopic vesiculotomy after completion of family.",0
1209,"Robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) and standardization of outcome reporting: a prospective, observational study on reaching the ""Trifecta and Pentafecta""","Partial nephrectomy (PN) for small renal masses is common, but outcomes are not reported in a standard manner. Traditionally, parameters such as 90-day mortality, blood loss, transfusion rates, length of stay, nephrometry scoring and complications are published but their collective impact on warm ischemia time (WIT) and post-surgery GFR is rarely determined. Thus, our aim was to assess if ""Trifecta"" and ""Pentafecta"" outcomes could be used as useful surgical outcome markers. A prospective database of 252 Robotic-Assisted PN (RAPN) cases (2008-2019) was analysed. ""Pentafecta"" was defined as achievement of ""Trifecta"" (negative surgical margin, no postoperative complications and WIT of < 25 min) plus over 90% estimated GFR preservation and no CKD stage upgrading at 1 year. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict factors which may prevent achieving a Trifecta/Pentafecta. Median tumour size was 3 cm and mean WIT was 15 min. Positive surgical margins (PSM) occurred in 2 cases. Overall, the intra-operative complication rate was 7%. One recurrence conferred 5-year cancer-free survival of 97%. Trifecta outcome was achieved in 169 (67%) and Pentafecta in 141 (56%) of cases. At logistic regression analysis, intraoperative blood loss was the only factor to affect Trifecta achievement (p = 0.018). Advanced patient age negatively impacted Pentafecta achievement (p = 0.010). The Trifecta and Pentafecta outcomes are easily applicable to PN data, and offer an internationally comparable PN outcome, quality measure. We recommend applying this standardization to national data collection to improve the quality of reporting and ease of interpretation of surgeon/centres' outcomes.",9
1210,Laparoscopic and Robotic Surgery for Endometrial and Cervical Cancer,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has many benefits, in the form of reduced postoperative morbidity, improved recovery and reduced inpatient stay. It is imperative, however, when new techniques are adopted, in the context of treating oncology patients, that the oncological efficacy and safety are established rigorously rather than assumed based on first principles. Here we have attempted to provide a comprehensive review of all the contentious and topical themes surrounding the use of MIS in the treatment of endometrial and cervix cancer following a thorough review of the literature. On the topic of endometrial cancer, we cover the role of laparoscopy in both early and advanced disease, together with the role and unique benefits of robotic surgery. The surgical challenge of patients with a raised body mass index and the frail and elderly are discussed and finally the role of sentinel lymph node assessment. For cervical cancer, the role of MIS for staging and primary treatment is covered, together with the interesting and highly specialist topics of fertility-sparing treatment, ovarian transposition and the live birth rate associated with this. We end with a discussion on the evidence surrounding the role of adjuvant hysterectomy following radical chemoradiation and pelvic exenteration for recurrent cervical cancer. MIS is the standard of care for endometrial cancer. The future of MIS for cervix cancer, however, remains uncertain. Current recommendations, based on the available evidence, are that the open approach should be considered the gold standard for the surgical management of early cervical cancer and that MIS should only be adopted in the context of research. Careful counselling of patients on the current evidence, discussing in detail the risks and benefits to enable them to make an informed choice, remains paramount.",3
1211,Robot-assistant for MRI-guided liver ablation: A pilot study,"Purpose:
        
      
      Percutaneous ablation under MRI-guidance allows treating otherwise inoperable liver tumors locally using a catheter probe. However, manually placing the probe is an error-prone and time consuming task that requires a considerable amount of training. The aim of this paper was to present a pneumatically actuated robotic instrument that can assist clinicians in MRI-guided percutaneous intervention of the liver and to assess its functionality in a clinical setting. The robot positions a needle-guide inside the MRI scanner bore and assists manual needle insertions outside the bore.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The robot supports double oblique insertions that are particularly challenging for less experienced clinicians. Additionally, the system employs only standard imaging sequences and can therefore be used on different MRI scanners without requiring prior integration. The repeatability and the accuracy of the robot were evaluated with an optical tracking system. The functionality of the robot was assessed in an initial pilot study on two patients that underwent MRI-guided laser ablation of the liver.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The robot positioned the needle-guide in a repeatable manner with a mean error of 0.35 mm and a standard deviation of 0.32 mm. The mean position error corresponding to the needle tip, measured for an equivalent needle length of 195 mm over 25 fixed points, was 2.5 mm with a standard deviation of 1.2 mm. The pilot study confirmed that the robot does not interfere with the equipment used for MRI-guided laser ablation and does not visibly affect the MR images. The robot setup integrated seamlessly within the established clinical workflow. The robot-assisted procedure was successfully completed on two patients, one of which required a complex double oblique insertion. For both patients, the insertion depth and the tumor size were within the range reported for previous MRI-guided percutaneous interventions. A third patient initially enrolled in the pilot study and was considerably heavier than the others, preventing the use of the robot and requiring several freehand insertion attempts.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The robot repeatability and accuracy are appropriate for liver tumors normally treated with MRI-guided ablation. The results of the pilot study endorse the clinical use of the robot in its current form: the robot is fully functional and MRI-compatible in a clinical setting and is suitable for double-oblique needle insertions.",0
1212,Systematic review of learning curves in robot-assisted surgery,"Background:
        
      
      Increased uptake of robotic surgery has led to interest in learning curves for robot-assisted procedures. Learning curves, however, are often poorly defined. This systematic review was conducted to identify the available evidence investigating surgeon learning curves in robot-assisted surgery.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched in February 2018, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, alongside hand searches of key congresses and existing reviews. Eligible articles were those assessing learning curves associated with robot-assisted surgery in patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Searches identified 2316 records, of which 68 met the eligibility criteria, reporting on 68 unique studies. Of these, 49 assessed learning curves based on patient data across ten surgical specialties. All 49 were observational, largely single-arm (35 of 49, 71 per cent) and included few surgeons. Learning curves exhibited substantial heterogeneity, varying between procedures, studies and metrics. Standards of reporting were generally poor, with only 17 of 49 (35 per cent) quantifying previous experience. Methods used to assess the learning curve were heterogeneous, often lacking statistical validation and using ambiguous terminology.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Learning curve estimates were subject to considerable uncertainty. Robust evidence was lacking, owing to limitations in study design, frequent reporting gaps and substantial heterogeneity in the methods used to assess learning curves. The opportunity remains for the establishment of optimal quantitative methods for the assessment of learning curves, to inform surgical training programmes and improve patient outcomes.",3
1213,Autonomous pick-and-place using the dVRK,"Purpose:
        
      
      Robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) is a tissue-preserving approach to treating renal cancer, where ultrasound (US) imaging is used for intra-operative identification of tumour margins and localisation of blood vessels. With the da Vinci Surgical System (Sunnyvale, CA), the US probe is inserted through an auxiliary access port, grasped by the robotic tool and moved over the surface of the kidney. Images from US probe are displayed separately to the surgical site video within the surgical console leaving the surgeon to interpret and co-registers information which is challenging and complicates the procedural workflow.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We introduce a novel software architecture to support a hardware soft robotic rail designed to automate intra-operative US acquisition. As a preliminary step towards complete task automation, we automatically grasp the rail and position it on the tissue surface so that the surgeon is then able to manipulate manually the US probe along it.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A preliminary clinical study, involving five surgeons, was carried out to evaluate the potential performance of the system. Results indicate that the proposed semi-autonomous approach reduced the time needed to complete a US scan compared to manual tele-operation.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Procedural automation can be an important workflow enhancement functionality in future robotic surgery systems. We have shown a preliminary study on semi-autonomous US imaging, and this could support more efficient data acquisition.",0
1214,Training in Robotic Surgery-an Overview,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      There has been a rapid and widespread adoption of the robotic surgical system with a lag in the development of a comprehensive training and credentialing framework. A literature search on robotic surgical training techniques and benchmarks was conducted to provide an evidence-based road map for the development of a robotic surgical skills for the novice robotic surgeon.
    


          Recent findings:
        
      
      A structured training curriculum is suggested incorporating evidence-based training techniques and benchmarks for progress. This usually involves sequential progression from observation, case assisting, acquisition of basic robotic skills in the dry and wet lab setting along with achievement of individual and team-based non-technical skills, modular console training under supervision, and finally independent practice. Robotic surgical training must be based on demonstration of proficiency and safety in executing basic robotic skills and procedural tasks prior to independent practice.",3
1215,Transoral Robotic Surgery and the Unknown Primary,"Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) comprises approximately 1%-5% of all head and neck malignancies. Primary site detection rates for metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remain variable, with current diagnostic imaging unable to identify all tumours. Prevailing evidence suggests that most head and neck CUP are located in the oropharynx. Diagnostic surgical efforts have been directed at sampling the entire oropharynx. Present techniques that make this possible include transoral robotic surgery (TORS). TORS Lingual tonsillectomy or tongue base mucosectomy performed in the setting of head and neck CUP increases the detection rate of occult tumour. The indication, surgical technique, evidence base, and controversies of performing TORS in the context of the unknown primary are presented.",1
1216,Current Practice of State-of-the-Art Surgical Coronary Revascularization,"Coronary artery bypass grafting remains one of the most commonly performed major surgeries, with well-established symptomatic and prognostic benefits in patients with multivessel and left main coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current indications, contemporary practice, and outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting. Despite an increasingly higher-risk profile of patients, outcomes have significantly improved over time, with significant reductions in operative mortality and perioperative complications. Five- and 10-year survival rates are ≈85% to 95% and 75%, respectively. A number of technical advances could further improve short- and long-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting. Developments in off-pump and no-touch procedures; epiaortic scanning; conduit selection, including bilateral internal mammary artery and radial artery use; intraoperative graft assessment; minimally invasive procedures, including robotic-assisted surgery; and hybrid coronary revascularization are discussed.",2
1217,Views of nurses and other health and social care workers on the use of assistive humanoid and animal-like robots in health and social care: a scoping review,"Background:
        
      
      Robots are introduced in many health and social care settings.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To provide an overview of the existing evidence related to the views of nurses and other health and social care workers about the use of assistive humanoid and animal-like robots.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Using the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines we searched MEDLINE, PUBMED, CINHAL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore digital library. Nineteen (19) articles met the criteria for inclusion.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Health care workers reported mixed views regarding the use of robots. They considered an array of tasks that robots could perform; they addressed the issue of patient safety and raised concerns about privacy.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A limited number of studies have explored the views of health care workers about the use of robots. Considering the fast pace with which technology is advancing in the care field, it is critical to conduct more research in this area. Impact Statement: Robots will increasingly have a role to play in nursing, health and social care. The potential impact will be challenging for the healthcare workforce. It is therefore important for nurses and other health and social care workers to engage in discussion regarding the contribution of robots and their impact not only on nursing care but also on future roles of health and social care workers.",7
1218,"Incidence, temporal trends and potential risk factors for aseptic loosening following primary unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: A meta-analysis of 96,294 knees","Background:
        
      
      Aseptic loosening (AL) is among the major reasons for revision of failed primary unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). There is an ongoing temporal increase in the use of UKA with a resultant increase in the revision burden. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of, temporal trends and risk factors for AL.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Longitudinal studies reporting the incidence of AL following primary UKA were sought from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library up to 6th April 2020. Incidence and relative risks (RR) (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We identified 62 studies for inclusion. Overall, 96,294 primary UKA procedures accounting for 1752 AL cases were included. AL incidence ranged from 0.00% to 22.70% over a 7.7 year weighted mean follow-up. The pooled random effects incidence (95% CI) was 1.77% (1.34-2.25) in the same follow-up period. The annual rate of AL was 0.10% (0.02-0.22). AL incidence increased with length of follow-up, but there was a temporal decrease from the 1970s onwards. Tibial loosening was more common than femoral component loosening: incidence (95% CI) of 1.63% (0.96-2.44) and 0.58% (0.20-1.09) respectively over a weighted follow-up of 6.6 years. Fixed bearing implant design and cemented fixation were both associated with increased AL risk, whereas robotic-assisted surgery was associated with decreased risk.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The overall incidence of AL following primary UKA is primarily driven by tibial component loosening and there is a temporal decline in rates. The use of mobile bearing, uncemented implants inserted with robotic assisted surgery may reduce the risk of AL.",1
1219,Robotic-assisted bladder diverticulectomy: point of technique to identify the diverticulum,"We aim to outline our technique of performing a robotic-assisted bladder diverticulectomy at our institution and report our surgical outcomes. We report the cases of three robotic-assisted bladder diverticulectomies, performed at the Royal Surrey County Hospital during the period of January 2014 to December 2015. Patient was positioned in low dorsal lithotomy position. A 6Fr double-J stent was prophylactically inserted at the start of the procedure. Foley catheter was placed over guide wire into the diverticulum and balloon inflated on the diverticulum neck. We used a transperitoneal extravesical approach to mobilise the distended bladder diverticulum, dissected en bloc and transected at the diverticulum neck in all cases. The bladder was closed in two layers with absorbable sutures. The procedures were uneventful, without post-operative complications and minimal blood loss. The median length of stay was 3 days and all three patients reported a significant improvement in all symptoms with non-significant post-void residuals. Robotic-assisted bladder diverticulectomy is a safe and effective procedure that results in both symptom relief and minimal post-void residuals.",1
1220,Laparoscopic versus robotic right colectomy with extra-corporeal or intra-corporeal anastomosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose:
        
      
      The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC) versus robotic right colectomy (RRC) using homogeneous subgroup analyses for extra-corporeal anastomosis (EA) and intra-corporeal anastomosis (IA).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to April 2020 for prospective or retrospective studies comparing LRC versus RRC on at least one short- or long-term outcome. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay (LOS). The secondary outcomes included operative and pathological results, survival, and total costs. LRC and RRC were compared using three homogeneous subgroups: without distinction by the type of anastomosis, EA only, and IA only. Pooled data analyses were performed using mean difference (MD) and random effects model.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thirty-seven of 448 studies were selected. The included patients were 21,397 for the LRC group and 2796 for the RRC group. Regardless for the type of anastomosis, RRC showed shorter LOS, lower blood loss, lower conversion rate, shorter time to flatus, and lower overall complication rate compared with LRC, but longer operative time and higher total costs. In the EA subgroup, RRC showed similar LOS, longer operative time, and higher costs compared with LRC, the other outcomes being similar. In the IA subgroup, RRC showed shorter LOS and longer operative time compared with LRC, with no difference for the remaining outcomes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Most included articles are retrospective, providing low-quality evidence and limiting conclusions. The more frequent use of the IA seems to explain the advantages of RRC over LRC.",5
1221,Initiation and feasibility of a multi-specialty minimally invasive surgical programme using a novel robotic system: A case series,"Introduction:
        
      
      There are a number of small case series examining new robotic surgical systems, but this is the first large case series assessing the feasibility of the Versius® system from CMR Surgical (1 Evolution Business Park, Cambridge, UK) in a multi-specialty setting.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      All patients undergoing Versius®-assisted surgery in a previously robot-naïve centre were consented for collection of data on demographics, pre-, intra-, and postoperative outcomes. Data collection was performed prospectively from the start of the robotic surgical programme.
    


          Results:
        
      
      160 operations were performed over a 19-month period, including 68 colorectal, 60 gynaecology, and 32 general surgery cases. The conversion rate to open surgery was 4.4% for colorectal, and 0% for gynaecology and general surgery. Median length of stay was 6 days for colorectal, 1 day for gynaecology, and 0 days for general surgery. Other outcomes were comparable to existing literature for robotic assisted surgery.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The Versius® system is safe and feasible for use in a multi-specialty minimally invasive surgery programme, including colorectal, general surgical & gynaecological cases, and operative volume can be safely and easily scaled up in a district general hospital setting without prior robotic surgical experience.",3
1222,Expert consensus on a train-the-trainer curriculum for robotic colorectal surgery,"Aim:
        
      
      Robotic techniques are being increasingly used in colorectal surgery. There is, however, a lack of training opportunities and structured training programmes. Robotic surgery has specific problems and challenges for trainers and trainees. Ergonomics, specific skills and user-machine interfaces are different from those in traditional laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study was to establish expert consensus on the requirements for a robotic train-the-trainer curriculum amongst robotic surgeons and trainers.
    


          Method:
        
      
      This is a modified Delphi-type study involving 14 experts in robotic surgery teaching. A reiterating 19-item questionnaire was sent out to the same group and agreement levels analysed. A consensus of 0.8 or higher was considered to be high-level agreement.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Response rates were 93-100% and most items reached high levels of agreement within three rounds. Specific requirements for a robotic faculty development curriculum included maximizing dual-console teaching, theatre team training, nontechnical skills training, patient safety, user-machine interface training and telementoring.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      A clear need for the development of a train-the-trainer curriculum has been identified. Further research is needed to assess feasibility, effectiveness and clinical impact of a robotic train-the-trainer curriculum.",3
1223,Outcomes of a Multicenter Training Program in Robotic Pancreatoduodenectomy (LAELAPS-3),"Objective:
        
      
      To assess feasibility and safety of a multicenter training program in robotic pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD) adhering to the IDEAL framework for implementation of surgical innovation.
    


          Background:
        
      
      Good results for RPD have been reported from single center studies. However, data on feasibility and safety of implementation through a multicenter training program in RPD are lacking.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A multicenter training program in RPD was designed together with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, including an online video bank, robot simulation exercises, biotissue drills, and on-site proctoring. Benchmark patients were based on the criteria of Clavien. Outcomes were collected prospectively (March 2016-October 2019). Cumulative sum analysis of operative time was performed to distinguish the first and second phase of the learning curve. Outcomes were compared between both phases of the learning curve. Trends in nationwide use of robotic and laparoscopic PD were assessed in the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Audit.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Overall, 275 RPD procedures were performed in seven centers by 15 trained surgeons. The recent benchmark criteria for low-risk PD were met by 125 (45.5%) patients. The conversion rate was 6.5% (n = 18) and median blood loss 250ml [interquartile range (IQR) 150-500]. The rate of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III complications was 44.4% (n = 122), postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B/C) rate 23.6% (n = 65), 90-day complication-related mortality 2.5% (n = 7) and 90-day cancer-related mortality 2.2.% (n = 6). Median postoperative hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 8-20). In the subgroup of patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 80), the major complication rate was 31.3% and POPF rate was 10%. Cumulative sum analysis for operative time found a learning curve inflection point at 22 RPDs (IQR 10-35) with similar rates of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III complications in the first and second phase (43.4% vs 43.8%, P = 0.956, respectively). During the study period the nationwide use of laparoscopic PD reduced from 15% to 1%, whereas the use of RPD increased from 0% to 25%.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This multicenter RPD training program in centers with sufficient surgical volume was found to be feasible without a negative impact of the learning curve on clinical outcomes.",3
1224,Optimal cerebral perfusion pressure via transcranial Doppler in TBI: application of robotic technology,"Individualized cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) targets may be derived via assessing the minimum of the parabolic relationship between an index of cerebrovascular reactivity and CPP. This minimum is termed the optimal CPP (CPPopt), and literature suggests that the further away CPP is from CPPopt, the worse is clinical outcome in adult traumatic brain injury (TBI). Typically, CPPopt estimation is based on intracranial pressure (ICP)-derived cerebrovascular reactivity indices, given ICP is commonly measured and provides continuous long duration data streams. The goal of this study is to describe for the first time the application of robotic transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the feasibility of determining CPPopt based on TCD autoregulation indices.",2
1225,Imageless robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA : Surgical technique and case-control study compared with primary robotic TKA,"Background and objective:
        
      
      It is evident from the national joint registries that numbers of revision knee arthroplasty operations are rising. The aim of this article is to introduce a new robotic-assisted approach in UKA to TKA revision arthroplasty and investigate the alignment accuracy, implant component use and surgery time and to compare it to primary robotic-assisted TKA arthroplasty.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective, case-control study included patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA (n = 20) and patients undergoing image-less robotic-assisted primary TKA (control group, n = 20) from 11/2018 to 07/2020. The control group was matched based on the BMI and natural alignment. Comparison of groups was based on postoperative alignment, outlier rate, tibial insert size, lateral bone resection depth, incision-to-wound closure time. All surgeries were performed by a single senior surgeon using the same bi-cruciate stabilizing TKA system. Statistical analysis consisted of parametric t‑testing and Fisher's exact test with a level of significance of p < 0.05.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The two groups showed no differences in mean BMI, natural alignment (p > 0.05) and mean overall limb alignment. No outlier was found for OLA and slope analysis. The smallest insert size (9 mm) was used in 70% of the cases in the revision group (n = 14) and in 90% of the cases in the primary group (n = 18, p = 0.24), distal femoral and tibial resection depth showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05). The incision to wound closure time was longer in the revision group but showed no significant difference.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Image-less robotic-assisted revision arthroplasty from UKA to TKA showed a comparable surgery time, and alignment accuracy in comparison to primary robotic-assisted TKA. Comparable bone preservation and subsequent tibial insert size use was observed for both groups.",8
1226,Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open radical retropubic prostatectomy: early outcomes from a randomised controlled phase 3 study,"Background:
        
      
      The absence of trial data comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and open radical retropubic prostatectomy is a crucial knowledge gap in uro-oncology. We aimed to compare these two approaches in terms of functional and oncological outcomes and report the early postoperative outcomes at 12 weeks.
    


          Method:
        
      
      In this randomised controlled phase 3 study, men who had newly diagnosed clinically localised prostate cancer and who had chosen surgery as their treatment approach, were able to read and speak English, had no previous history of head injury, dementia, or psychiatric illness or no other concurrent cancer, had an estimated life expectancy of 10 years or more, and were aged between 35 years and 70 years were eligible and recruited from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (Brisbane, QLD). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or radical retropubic prostatectomy. Randomisation was computer generated and occurred in blocks of ten. This was an open trial; however, study investigators involved in data analysis were masked to each patient's condition. Further, a masked central pathologist reviewed the biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Primary outcomes were urinary function (urinary domain of EPIC) and sexual function (sexual domain of EPIC and IIEF) at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 months and oncological outcome (positive surgical margin status and biochemical and imaging evidence of progression at 24 months). The trial was powered to assess health-related and domain-specific quality of life outcomes over 24 months. We report here the early outcomes at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The per-protocol populations were included in the primary and safety analyses. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), number ACTRN12611000661976.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between Aug 23, 2010, and Nov 25, 2014, 326 men were enrolled, of whom 163 were randomly assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy and 163 to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. 18 withdrew (12 assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy and six assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy); thus, 151 in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group proceeded to surgery and 157 in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group. 121 assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy completed the 12 week questionnaire versus 131 assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Urinary function scores did not differ significantly between the radical retropubic prostatectomy group and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group at 6 weeks post-surgery (74·50 vs 71·10; p=0·09) or 12 weeks post-surgery (83·80 vs 82·50; p=0·48). Sexual function scores did not differ significantly between the radical retropubic prostatectomy group and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group at 6 weeks post-surgery (30·70 vs 32·70; p=0·45) or 12 weeks post-surgery (35·00 vs 38·90; p=0·18). Equivalence testing on the difference between the proportion of positive surgical margins between the two groups (15 [10%] in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group vs 23 [15%] in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group) showed that equality between the two techniques could not be established based on a 90% CI with a Δ of 10%. However, a superiority test showed that the two proportions were not significantly different (p=0·21). 14 patients (9%) in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group versus six (4%) in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group had postoperative complications (p=0·052). 12 (8%) men receiving radical retropubic prostatectomy and three (2%) men receiving robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy experienced intraoperative adverse events.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      These two techniques yield similar functional outcomes at 12 weeks. Longer term follow-up is needed. In the interim, we encourage patients to choose an experienced surgeon they trust and with whom they have rapport, rather than a specific surgical approach.

1227,Robotic Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Conventional total knee arthroplasty(TKA) is one of the safest and cost-effective procedures performed in orthopedics. With a patient satisfaction rate measured within the range of 75% to 92%, TKA presents a powerful method for pain relief and functional restoration in patients with advanced arthritis when exhausting all of the non-operative options. As technology and surgical procedures develop, surgeons try to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. Robots present a tool in which surgeons can do surgical procedures while minimizing human error and maximizing operative accuracy. The term ‘robot’ begins from the Czech word ‘robota,’ which means forced labor or activity. In 1920, Karel Capek, the Czech play writer, wrote a science fiction play called "" Rossum's Universal Robots,"" where Robots were a series of factory-manufactured artificial people that undertook ordinary tasks for their human masters. The play premiered on the 25th of January 1921, and that is when the word ""robot"" was introduced to the English language and to science fiction as a whole. The first robot surgery ever was performed in 1988 to perform neurosurgical biopsies. Since then, the applicability of robotics in surgery has progressed remarkably. Besides the rapidly increasing needs for TKA in the past years, robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has increased in number considerably. Due to increasing average ages, populations encounter a much higher rate of osteoarthritis, so they need a greater amount of TKA.
    

      
      The first surgical specialty to use robots was neurosurgery. In 1988, the first robotic surgery was recorded for performing neurosurgical biopsies. Followed by urosurgery, in 1991, for performing prostatic transurethral resection. Both specialties reported improved perfection and decreased the incidence of iatrogenic complications using robotic surgery. After that, the widespread use of robots in various surgical specialties with the advantages of smaller operative incisions, increased precision in soft tissue management, postoperative quicker recovery and return to work, and decreased length of hospital stay.
    

      
      In orthopedics, a robotic TKR is designed to decrease the mistakes associated with bone cuts and prosthesis position and alignment. Robotic TKR has better surgical and clinical patient outcomes than conventional TKR. The first robotic-assisted TKA was performed in 1988 in the United Kingdom.",1
1228,Cost effectiveness and robot-assisted urologic surgery: does it make dollars and sense?,"Introduction:
        
      
      The introduction of the robotic surgical platform has led to distinct changes in practice patterns and the utilization of minimally invasive surgery in urology. While use of the robotic system is associated with improvements in perioperative outcomes such as estimated blood loss and hospital stay, there are significant fixed and variable costs with the purchase, maintenance and use of the robotics system that has led many authors to investigate the cost effectiveness of robotic urologic surgery. We sought to examine the best current available evidence for the cost effectiveness of robotic urologic surgery.
    


          Evidence acquisition:
        
      
      Comprehensive electronic literature searches were conducted without language restriction to identify reports of published studies within PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Science. Relevant articles were examined and reference lists cross referenced to find additional pertinent publications.
    


          Evidence synthesis:
        
      
      PubMed literature searches of ""robot urology cost"" (304 articles) ""robotic prostatectomy cost"" (215 articles), ""robotic nephrectomy cost"" (87 articles), ""robotic cystectomy cost"" (44 articles) and ""robotic pyeloplasty cost"" (41 articles) were initially reviewed in abstract form to find appropriate articles for inclusion. Given that robotic cystectomy (559 articles), robotic pyeloplasty (344 articles) robotic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (59 articles) are less frequently performed than robotic prostatectomy, all available articles published from January 1st 2000 until July 31st 2016 were reviewed for potential inclusion. After excluding duplicates, appropriate articles were pulled for full text review. 49 articles were used for the final analysis.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The available literature on the cost effectiveness of robotic urologic surgery is somewhat limited by heterogeneity of research methods, local cost variations and methods for determining costs associated with surgical outcomes. The introduction of the robotic surgical platform has led to a dramatic change in the availability and utilization of laparoscopic surgery and is associated with both favorable perioperative outcomes as well as significantly greater fixed costs related to instrumentation and equipment expenses. Well-designed trials comparing open and robotic approaches in the contemporary era of widespread robotic adoption with quality of life and validated economic metrics will be necessary to provide evidence for continued use of this valuable technology.",1
1229,Robot-assisted rehabilitation of hand function after stroke: Development of prediction models for reference to therapy,"Background:
        
      
      Recovery of hand function after stroke represents the hardest target for clinicians. Robot-assisted therapy has been proved to be effective for hand recovery. Nevertheless, studies aimed to refer patients to the best therapy are missing.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      With the aim to identify which clinical features are predictive for referring to robot-assisted hand therapy, 174 stroke patients were assessed with: Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Reaching Performance Scale (RPS), Box and Block Test (BBT), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Nine Hole Pegboard Test (NHPT). Moreover, patients ability to control the robot with residual force and surface EMG (sEMG) independently, was checked. ROC curves were calculated to determine which of the measures were the predictors of the event.
    


          Results:
        
      
      sEMG control (AUC = 0.925) was significantly determined by FMA upper extremity (FMUE) (>24/66) and sensation (>23/24) sections, MAS at Flexor Carpi (<3/4) and total MAS (>4/20). Force control (AUC = 0.928) was correlated only with FMUE (>24/66).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      FMUE and MAS were the best predictors of preserved ability to control the device by two different modalities. This finding opens the possibility to plan specific therapies aimed at maximizing the highest functional outcome achievable after stroke.",5
1230,Real-time assessment of learning curve for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy,"Introduction:
        
      
      The learning curves analysed to date for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy are based on arbitrary cut-offs of the total cases.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We analysed a large dataset of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies from a single centre between 2008 and 2019 for assessment of the learning curve for perioperative outcomes with respect to time and individual cases.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 1,406 patients were evaluated, with mean operative time 198.08 minutes and mean console time 161.05 minutes. A plot of operative time and console time showed an initial decline followed by a near-constant phase. The inflection points were detected at 1,398 days (308th case) for operative time and 1,470 days (324th case) for console time, with a declining trend of 8.83 minutes and 7.07 minutes, respectively, per quarter-year (p<0.001). Mean estimated blood loss showed a 70.04% reduction between the start (214.76ml) and end (64.35ml) (p<0.001). The complication rate did not vary with respect to time (p=0.188) or the number of procedures (p=0.354). There was insufficient evidence to claim that the number of operations (p=0.326), D'Amico classification (p=0.114 for intermediate versus low; p=0.158 for high versus low) or time (p=0.114) was associated with the odds of positive surgical margins.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It takes about 300 cases and nearly 4 years to standardise operative and console times, with a requirement of around 80 cases per annum for a single surgical team in the initial years to optimise the outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.",5
1231,Therapeutic engagement in robot-assisted psychological interventions: A systematic review,"Purpose:
        
      
      Therapeutic engagement is a key component of psychological interventions. Robot-assisted psychological interventions appear to have therapeutic benefits for service users that are challenging to engage. However, engagement with robots in robot-assisted psychological interventions is not well understood. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the quality of therapeutic engagement in robot-assisted psychological interventions (PROSPERO: 122437).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo and Medline were searched until 15 January 2021 for studies which quantitatively evaluated therapeutic engagement in robot-assisted psychological interventions. The Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool was used to assess methodological dimensions of studies.
    


          Results:
        
      
      3647 studies were identified through database searching. Thirty studies (N = 1462), published between 2004 and 2020, and from 14 countries, were included. Robots were typically toy animals or humanoids and were used to provide support and improve wellbeing through social interaction. Studies primarily tested robots on older adults with dementia and children with autism and indicated positive therapeutic engagement. Twelve studies included a control group. EPHPP ratings were 'strong' (N = 1), 'moderate' (N = 10) and 'weak' (N = 19).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Therapeutic engagement between service users and robots is generally positive. Methodological limitations of studies, such as small sample sizes, and lack of control groups and longitudinal data, mean that the field is in early stages of its development and conclusions should be drawn with caution. There are important practical and ethical implications for policymakers to consider, such as responsible clinical practice and how service users may understand the therapeutic relationship with robots.",7
1232,Robotically assisted thymectomy: a review of the literature,"The aim of this literature review is to see where the robotic thymectomy stands nowadays. A thorough search of the PubMed revealed eighty-two related articles which reviewed comprehensively. The zero intraoperative mortality, the minimal intraoperative morbidity, as well as the recorded recurrence rate of 0-11.1% and complete stable remission rate of 0-40% suggests that the robotic-assisted thymectomy is a feasible, safe and an upcoming procedure. However, the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials prevents this technique to become the standard approach for the nonce.",1
1233,Comparison of perioperative outcomes following transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: a propensity-matched analysis of VCQI database,"Objective:
        
      
      To compare perioperative outcomes following retroperitoneal robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RPRAPN) and transperitoneal robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (TPRAPN).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      With this Vattikuti Collective Quality Initiative (VCQI) database, study propensity scores were calculated according to the surgical access (TPRAPN and RPRAPN) for the following independent variables, i.e., age, sex, side of the surgery, RENAL nephrometry scores (RNS), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum creatinine. The study's primary outcome was the comparison of trifecta between the two groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In this study, 309 patients who underwent RPRAPN were matched with 309 patients who underwent TPRAPN. The two groups matched well for age, sex, tumor side, polar location of the tumor, RNS, preoperative creatinine and eGFR. Operative time and warm ischemia time were significantly shorter with RPRAPN. Intraoperative blood loss and need for blood transfusion were lower with RPRAPN. There was a significantly higher number of intraoperative complications with RPRAPN. However, there was no difference in the two groups for postoperative complications. Trifecta outcomes were better with RPRAPN (70.2% vs. 53%, p < 0.0001) compared to TPRAPN. We noted no significant change in overall results when controlled for tumor location (anteriorly or posteriorly). The surgical approach, tumor size and RNS were identified as independent predictors of trifecta on multivariate analysis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      RPRAPN is associated with superior perioperative outcomes in well-selected patients compared to TPRAPN. However, the data for the retroperitoneal approach were contributed by a few centers with greater experience with this technique, thus limiting the generalizability of the results of this study.",9
1234,Evaluation of Haptic Feedback on Bimanually Teleoperated Laparoscopy for Endometriosis Surgery,"Robotic minimal invasive surgery is gaining acceptance in surgical care. In contrast with the appreciated three-dimensional vision and enhanced dexterity, haptic feedback is not offered. For this reason, robotics is not considered beneficial for delicate interventions such as the endometriosis. Overall, haptic feedback remains debatable and yet unproven except for some simple scenarios such as fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery exercises.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This work investigates the benefits of haptic feedback on more complex surgical gestures, manipulating delicate tissue through coordination between multiple instruments.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A new training exercise, ""endometriosis surgery exercise"" (ESE) has been devised approximating the setting for monocular robotic endometriosis treatment. A bimanual bilateral teleoperation setup was designed for laparoscopic laser surgery. Haptic guidance and haptic feedback are, respectively, offered to the operator. User experiments have been conducted to assess the validity of ESE and examine possible advantages of haptic technology during execution of bimanual surgery.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Content and face validity of ESE were established by participating surgeons. Surgeons suggested ESE also as a mean to train lasering skills, and interaction forces on endometriotic tissue were found to be significantly lower when a bilateral controller is used. Collisions between instruments and the environment were less frequent and so were situations marked as potentially dangerous.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study provides some promising results suggesting that haptics may offer a distinct advantage in complex robotic interventions were fragile tissue is manipulated.
    


          Significance:
        
      
      Patients need to know whether it should be incorporated. Improved understanding of the value of haptics is important as current commercial surgical robots are widely used but do not offer haptics.",1
1235,Neural Tuning Functions Underlie Both Generalization and Interference,"In sports, the role of backswing is considered critical for generating a good shot, even though it plays no direct role in hitting the ball. We recently demonstrated the scientific basis of this phenomenon by showing that immediate past movement affects the learning and recall of motor memories. This effect occurred regardless of whether the past contextual movement was performed actively, passively, or shown visually. In force field studies, it has been shown that motor memories generalize locally and that the level of compensation decays as a function of movement angle away from the trained movement. Here we examine if the contextual effect of past movement exhibits similar patterns of generalization and whether it can explain behavior seen in interference studies. Using a single force-field learning task, the directional tuning curves of both the prior contextual movement and the subsequent force field adaptive movements were measured. The adaptation movement direction showed strong directional tuning, decaying to zero by 90° relative to the training direction. The contextual movement direction exhibited a similar directional tuning, although the effect was always above 60%. We then investigated the directional tuning of the passive contextual movement using interference tasks, where the contextual movements that uniquely specified the force field direction were separated by ±15° or ±45°. Both groups showed a pronounced tuning effect, which could be well explained by the directional tuning functions for single force fields. Our results show that contextual effect of past movement influences predictive force compensation, even when adaptation does not require contextual information. However, when such past movement contextual information is crucial to the task, such as in an interference study, it plays a strong role in motor memory learning and recall. This work demonstrates that similar tuning responses underlie both generalization of movement direction during dynamic learning and contextual movements in both single force field and interference tasks.",6
