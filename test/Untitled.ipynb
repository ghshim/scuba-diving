       "[\"Understanding human trust in machine partners has become imperative due to the widespread use of intelligent machines in a variety of applications and contexts. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether human-beings trust a social robot-i.e. a human-like robot that embodies emotional states, empathy, and non-verbal communication-differently than other types of agents. To do so, we adapt the well-known economic trust-game proposed by Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) to assess whether receiving a promise from a robot increases human-trust in it. We find that receiving a promise from the robot increases the trust of the human in it, but only for individuals who perceive the robot very similar to a human-being. Importantly, we observe a similar pattern in choices when we replace the humanoid counterpart with a real human but not when it is replaced by a computer-box. Additionally, we investigate participants' psychophysiological reaction in terms of cardiovascular and electrodermal activity. Our results highlight an increased psychophysiological arousal when the game is played with the social robot compared to the computer-box. Taken all together, these results strongly support the development of technologies enhancing the humanity of robots.\",\n",

It was rated as a feasible (3.95/5) and acceptable (4/5) tool for training. Experts performed significantly better than novice group in 6 metrics in the UVA including time (p = 0.0005), distance by camera (p = 0.0010) and instrument collisions (p = 0.0033), as well as task-specific metrics such as number of unnecessary needle piercing points (p = 0.0463). In novice surgeons, a significant improvement in performance after training was seen in many metrics for both tasks. For bladder neck dissection task, this included time (p < 0.0001), instrument collisions (p = 0.0013) and total time instruments are out of view (p = 0.0251). For UVA, this included time (p = 0.0135), instrument collisions (p = 0.0066) and task-specific metrics such as injury to the urethra (p = 0.0032) and bladder (p = 0.0189).\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Conclusions:\\n        \\n      \\n      Surgeons found this full procedural VR training module to be a realistic, feasible and acceptable component for a robotic surgical training programme. Construct validity was proven between expert and novice surgeons. Novice surgeons have shown a significant learning curve over 5.5 hours of training, suggesting this module could be used in a surgical curriculum for acquisition of technical skills. Further implementation of this module into the curriculum and continued analysis would be beneficial to gauge how it can be fully utilised.\",\n",

       " \"Purpose:\\n        \\n      \\n      Robotic endovascular technology may offer advantages over conventional manual catheter techniques. Our aim was to compare the endovascular catheter path-length (PL) for robotic versus manual contralateral gate cannulation during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), using video motion analysis (VMA).\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Methods:\\n        \\n      \\n      This was a multicentre retrospective cohort study with fluoroscopic video recordings of 24 EVAR cases (14 robotic, 10 manual) performed by experienced operators (> 50 procedures), obtained from four leading European centres. Groups were comparable with no statistically significant differences in aneurysm size (p = 0.47) or vessel tortuosity (p = 0.68). Two trained assessors used VMA to calculate the catheter PL during contralateral gate cannulation for robotic versus manual approaches.\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Results:\\n        \\n      \\n      There was a high degree of inter-observer reliability (Cronbach's α > 0.99) for VMA. Median robotic PL was 35.7 cm [interquartile range, IQR (30.8-51.0)] versus 74.1 cm [IQR (44.3-170.4)] for manual cannulation, p = 0.019. Robotic cases had a median cannulation time of 5.33 min [IQR (4.58-6.49)] versus 1.24 min [IQR (1.13-1.35)] in manual cases (p = 0.0083). Generated efficiency ratios (PL/aorto-iliac centrelines) was 1.6 (1.2-2.1) in robotic cases versus 2.6 (1.7-7.0) in manual, p = 0.031.\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Conclusion:\\n        \\n      \\n      Robot-assisted contralateral gate cannulation in EVAR leads to decreased navigation path lengths and increased economy of movement compared with manual catheter techniques. The benefit could be maximised by prioritising robotic catheter shaping over habituated reliance on guidewire manipulation. Robotic technology has the potential to reduce the endovascular footprint during manipulations even for experienced operators with the added advantage of zero radiation exposure.\",\n",

Surgeon-reported degree of neurovascular-bundle preservation, pathologist-reported positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, and 2-yr prostate-specific antigen-relapse rates were measured.\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Results and limitations:\\n        \\n      \\n      Among 1702 preoperatively potent men, we found enhanced erectile function recovery for low/intermediate-risk patients in the robot-assisted group at 3 mo. For patients with high-risk tumours, point estimates for erectile function recovery at 24 mo favoured the open surgery group. The degree of neurovascular bundle preservation and erectile function recovery were greater correlated for robot-assisted surgery. In pT2 tumours, 10% versus 17% PSM rates were observed for open and robot-assisted surgery, respectively; corresponding rates for pT3 tumours were 48% and 33%. These differences were associated with biochemical recurrence in pT3 but not pT2 disease. The study is limited by its nonrandomised design and relatively short follow-up.\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Conclusions:\\n        \\n      \\n      Earlier recovery of erectile function in the robot-assisted surgery group in lower-risk patients is counterbalanced by lower PSM rates for open surgeons in organ-confined disease; thus, both open and robotic surgeons need to consider this trade-off when determining the plane of surgical dissection. Robot-assisted surgery also facilitates easier identification of nerve preservation planes during radical prostatectomy as well as wider dissection for pT3 cases.\\n    \\n\\n\\n          Patient summary:\\n        \\n      \\n      For prostate cancer surgery, an open operation reduces erection problems in high-risk cancers but has higher relapse rates than robotic surgery. Relapse rates appear similar in low/intermediate-risk cancers and the robot appears better at preserving erections in these cases.',\n",

However, it might be expected in the future that new technologies will improve the technical possibilities to improve the robotic platform for minimally invasive surgery in children. To date, a few applications are considered safe and efficient (in experienced hands), considering that the team has to be aware of some challenges to overcome regarding anesthesia, material, and technique adaptation to the patient.

Among five patients diagnosed with intraductal carcinoma, three experienced early BCR during the vaccination period. All patients that developed BCR remained in stable disease within a median of 99 months (range: 74-99). The baseline immune response was significantly associated with the immune response during the vaccination period (p = 0.015). For patients diagnosed with extraprostatic extension (EPE), time to BCR was longer in vaccine responders than in non-responders (p = 0.09).
